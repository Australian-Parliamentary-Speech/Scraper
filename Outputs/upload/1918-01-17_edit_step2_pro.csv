I think that every honorable member realizes the seriousness of the present position and the responsibility that rests upon us all. This responsibility is not confined to Ministers and party leaders; every honorable member must shoulder his share of it. The recent vote on conscription has created a most serious political situation. The few remarks that I have to offer now will be arranged under three heads. These are (1) the failure to secure by conscription the necessary reinforcements for our men at the Front; (2) the extent to which Australias relationswith other portions of the Empire and the Allies are affected by the vote; (3) the effect of recent events on the public life of Australia. I am one of those who thought the holding of the first referendum on conscription a mistake. The holding of the second referendum was a blunder. Although I advocated conscription to the utmost of my ability,I never addressed a meeting asking the electors to. vote Yes without feeling the impropriety of calling on women to vote to send men to the war. The proposition was not a fair one. Parliament should have taken the responsibility. I have never been able to follow the somewhat conflicting figures that have been published; but we know that the voluntary system in Australia has given magnificent results results, it can be safely said, as good as, if not better than, those obtained by that system in any other country. Had any one, when, at the commencement of the war Mr. Fisher offered 50,000 men for service abroad, declared that within three years there would be over 300,000 Australian volunteers under arms, he would have been regarded as an. exceedingly rash prophet. But the voluntary system failed in Canada, in New Zealand, and in England to give the necessary reinforcements, and it has failed also in Australia in that respect. When Great Britain found that she could not get voluntarily the men which her authorities deemed necessary, she adopted the compulsory system.

During two electoral campaigns, at least, preference to unionists was a prominent issue, and in visiting the timber districts of my electorate, where most of the mill hands are unionists, I found it difficult to answer a question which they put to me, embodying an argument which members of the Labour party have used with effect on every platform in Australia. They said, Is it fair that when we have taken the risks of. dismissal and victimisation in striking to better our conditions, men who have stood outside and made no sacrifice should obtain the full benefits of unionism? That is the argument on which the claims to preference to unionists have been based. It is contended that it is not fair for men to remain outside of unions, and then to enjoy the benefits that unionism has won for unionists at their own risk. I now ask, Is it fair for families to remain outside the military movement, and to accept the benefits conferred by the sacrifice of others? The best argument I have heard for conscription came from an old lady, the wife of a worker, during my first referendum campaign. Some one had asked, Do you think conscription fair? Do you think that a man should be sent to the war without his consent?  This old lady said,  I have three boys, one of whom is in the trenches, another in the hospital, and a third just gone into camp, while my neighbour here has five big boys, none of whom has enlisted. Do you call that fair?  Can any one say that it is fair, democratic, or honest, that whole families should take no part in the war while others are sacrificing all their available men? There are families of three, four, and five eligible boys not one of whom has enlisted.

The Minister for the Navy, the Leader of the Liberal wing of the Nationalist Government said yesterday,  Come in and help us ; if I am standing in the way I will get out. My honorable friends opposite cannot escape their full share of responsibility. Does any one say that men are not required to reinforce the Australians at the Front? An event happened at Hobart two days after the last referendum, which, if it had happened two days before the vote was taken, would have turned thousands of votes. A large transport put into Hobart with New Zealand troops. They were not wounded or disabled men, but men being sent back to New Zealand on six months furlough, to enjoy a wellearned rest. Why ? Because there were other New Zealanders to take their places. Not one man can leave the Australian trenches or Australian hospitals in England to come to Australia for a rest, because there is no one to take his place. I know men who have been at the Front for three years. They have been wounded, sent back to England, patched up, and then sent back to the trenches. They have been patched up three times, and are again back in the trenches. Do not honorable members think that those men require a rest, and have well earned it?

Nothing matters but winning this war, and nothing is so important to me as that the men who have been in the trenches for three years, many of them patched up and sent back again from time to time, should be given a rest and a fighting chance for their lives. Whatever means will give reinforcements, whatever means will enable us to see that those men get the assistance which, God knows, they want, and which every man in this Parliament and in. every party in Australia stands pledged to give them, should be taken. We pledged ourselves to help them when we sent them away, cheering them, singing Australia will be there, and showering honours on them. We must not let them rot unaided in the trenches. Are we going to see them wounded and patched up and sent back time after time, when we know that the New Zealanders are coming back, and getting a wellearned rest, because there are men to take their places? Not one Australian can. bo allowed out of the trenches today, because there is no one to take his place. Those of us who are getting letters from friends at Home know that men who have been wounded are leaving England again, all honour to. them, and going back when they are not fit to go. There is a shocking responsibility on every honorable member of the House, and on any party that refuses to insist that these men should get the help that some of them are dying for tor day, and dying, too,, without a quiver. The only thing Australia has to do is to see that reinforcements are obtained to back up her men. We are responsible. Some one said that we did not send them, there. But we did send them there, and we must take the full responsibility for having done so. The great responsibility, therefore, rests upon us to see that reinforcements are sent to help them. I think we can get reinforcements by the way I have,, perhaps feebly, outlined. I have tried to speak without bringing into the debate the slightest illfeeling, and have studiously avoided hurting the feelings of any man in the House. This is not a time for personalities.. It is a time in which all must accept their responsibilities.

The Prime Minister has no regard whatever for public opinion, if we may judge by his action when the Leader of the Opposition moved his motion of censure. The Prime Minister then endeavoured to stifle all criticism of himself and his colleagues, except such as might take place during the discussion of a Supply Bill, when, in the midst of a debate about the Ministry, a member on the Ministerial side .might easily intervene to put the House off the track by discussing the administration of the Northern Territory, or Papua, or some other question.  The plain duty of the Prime Minister was not to allow any questions to be answered; not to permit a Supply Bill to go through, but to follow the invariable practice adopted by Prime Ministers since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. The practice was laid down by Sir Edmund Barton. When Sir George (then Mr.) Reid gave notice of the first motion of censure in the Federal Parliament, Sir Edmund Barton immediately rose and moved,  That the House do now adjourn. The House accordingly adjourned, and on the next day of sitting, when the honorable member for Maranoa (Mr. Page) desired to ask a question without notice, Sir Edmund Barton at once replied,  May I explain to my honorable friend that with a motion of censure pending it is the constitutional practice to suspend the answering of questions. No business whatever was done until that motion of censure, the debate on which extended over a fortnight, had been disposed of. We can gather from the action of the present Prime Minister that he and his colleagues wish to curtail this debate as much as possible. There is no reason why we should go into recess other than that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Watt), both old political hands, no doubt recognise that if they can crowd the debate into a few days the press will have but little opportunity to report the speeches of honorable members. We had last night a splendid speech by the honorable member for Barrier (Mr.« Considine), and I think the press this morning devote just about twenty lines to it. The Prime Minister, in replying to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), after certain members sitting on the Ministerial crossbenches had informed the Government that if they persisted in the course they were taking they would wreck the purple adjective party, endeavoured to draw us off the track by saying There has been no reference to the great war. ...... We stand on the brink of a precipice, over which we may topple tomorrow. ...... Nothing was said of the great and tragic situation as it presents itself to the world today...... By a hairs breadth we stand on the edge of a precipice..... Millions of Germans are said to have gone from the Eastern frontier, and strong forces are concentrating at Cambrai.

The objection which the right honorable member (Mr. Hughes) had to the proposed Coalition, at that time may be put in a nutshell. He said,  Sir William Lyne must be in such a Coalition, and Mr. Watson must be a member of it. We cannot have in that Government three representatives of New South Wales. That was the reason he opposed the Coalition. The Watson Government was formed, and the right honorable gentleman was a member of it.

I wish now to call attention to some of the unfair tactics that were adopted by the Prime Minister during the referendum campaign. In passing, I would like to mention a curious practice which has grown up in our public life owing to the methods pursued by the right honorable gentleman. Prior to his advent to office, a daily newspaper, like the Argus, would never dream of accepting gifts either at the hands of the Government or of any individual. But when the recent campaign ) started, what did the Prime Minister do ? Apparently, he visited the Argus officeand requested that the services of Mr. Dumas, one of its firstclass reporters, should be placed at his disposal. Thisgentleman, it is said, was paid £12 per week, in addition to an allowance of £7 per week for expenses, to accompany the Prime Minister. That is an extraordinary thing in the life of public journalism in Australia. Every newspaper with which I have been acquainted in the past would decline to accept an offer of that sort. I say nothing against Mr. Dumas in the matter. He is a good reporter, and an assiduous and clever workman. But the Argus, instead of acting up to the high standard of public journalism which has been set ever since the establishment of the Sydney Morning Herald, allowed the Prime Minister to take this man away from its office, permitted him to accompany the right honorable gentleman, to eat his salt, and to prepare reports, of the meetings which he addressed. In that way it avoided the expense .which otherwise would have attached to the sending of a reporter throughout the Commonwealth to accompany the Prime Minister. Any journal should refrain from accepting an offer of that kind. It is the invariable practice of our daily newspapers to send a journalist with the Prime Minister on his tours of the Commonwealth, but, by paying that gentleman, they have hitherto reserved to themselves their right to criticise the Prime Minister. By handing over Mr. Dumas to the right honorable gentleman . and accepting this free gift of news from him, or from the persons who paid Mr. Dumas I do not know that the Prime Minister or the Government paid for his services the Argus was prevented from criticising the Prime Minister, and this circumstance, no doubt, accounted for the fulsome flattery which appeared in the reports published from time1 to time. Head the account of Mr. Hughes meeting at Warwick  Mr. Hughes   Assailed hy Mob   Riot at Warwick, Queensland   Free Fight on Railway Station. That is a grossly exaggerated account of what occurred, and it was written by Mr. Dumas. In connexion with its publication I acknowledge that the Argus had the decency to break the law. It was ashamed to put Mr. Dumas signature to the report, although his name did appear in other newspapers to which that report was despatched. In so acting, the Argus violated the law, which requires that all reports and speeches of a political character at such a time should bear the signatures of their authors. Then the Argus complains of the censorship. Now, quite recently I sent a letter to that journal on the question of conscription. It did not appear. I then wrote a letter to Dr. E. S. Cunningham, its editor. Dr.  Cunningham is not a medical doctor he is one of those gentlemen who, at a Press Conference, received the title of doctor. In other words, he is a literary doctor. I wrote to the doctor a courteous letter, ask ing him why he had not inserted my letter in opposition to conscription, thanking him for a reply, and enclosing a stamped envelope. I wished to make it impossible for him to refuse to reply. What do honorable members think I got by way of answer ?

It is the first time that I have heard that the insertion of a letter is within the editors rejection. I wonder what the editors rejection is?The Argus almost invariably refuses to insert the letters of public men on public matters. Yet I consider that, as a public man, representing a constituency in Queensland, the columns of the Argus ought to be open to me at any time so long as I keep within reasonable bounds in the matter of space and adhere to parliamentary language.  I also had another experience this time with the Sydney Morning Herald. Honorable members will recollect that the Argus report of Mr., Hughes meeting at Warwick  represented him as speaking as  a member of the Imperial War Cabinet. That phrase, I confess, struck me. I had never heard that Mr. Hughes was a member of the Imperial War Cabinet, and accordingly I wrote to the press about it. Thereupon the Sydney Morning Herald stated that Mr. Higgs, having cast doubt upon the declaration that Mr. Hughes was a member of the Imperial War Council, Mr. Hughes had remarked  that this circumstance showed Mr. Higgs utter ignorance of matters of common knowledge. Now I said nothing whatever about the  Imperial War Count,..:,  I referred to the Imperial War Cabinet, which is a different matter altogether. Thereupon, I wrote a letter to the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald,Mr. T. S. Heaney, pointing this out, but although he had allowed Mr. Hughes to hold me up to public ridicule and contempt, he refused to insert my explanation. In my opinion there is not another editor in Australia who, in similar circumstances, would have declined to publish my communication. Now I come to the military raid upon the Government Printing Office in Brisbane, which was made under the direction of the Prime Minister. I hold in my hand a copy of the Queensland Hansard, No. 37. This raid took place prior to the battle at Warwick, and I offer it as a possible explanation as to why the Prime Minister was assaulted at Warwick. Mr.J.H. Catts.

Indeed, he may know a good deal about it. Certainly he knows a very great deal about the interruptions of the proFederation meetings, because he was one of the leaders of the antiFederal movement in Sydney at the time. He, therefore, knows a good deal of the breaking up of the proFederal meetings. I have a vivid recollection of what Sir George Reid said on the occasion to which I have referred. He did not get angry. He did not rush round with his hand, not his face, bleeding and vow that he would get this person or that.

By the way, the exSpeaker of this Chamber and myself happened to be in Brisbane at the time the raid was made upon the Queensland Government Printing Office in connexion with Queensland Hansard,  No. 37. Now, this particular issue of Hansard is a public record of the debate which took place, not only on the military censorship, but on the various subjects which occupied the attention of the Queensland Parliament. Mr. Hughes objected to that special number of Hansard because some portions of it were printed in black type. But those portions, I would point out, are the portions which the censor refused to allow to be published. I have seen the instructions that were issued by the censor in Brisbane when Mr. Ryan was about to deliver his speech. That official directed that all reports of Mr. Ryans speech should be submitted to the censor. But when the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr. Groom) visited Brisbane the following day to deliver his speech the censor sent out a regulation countermanding the order for the submission of public speeches to censorship. The result was that Mr. Ryans speech was censored throughout Queensland, while Mr. Grooms speech was allowed to go forth without any censorship whatever. Yet the day after the delivery of Mr. Grooms speech the censorship of such utterances was again imposed. Surely nobody can support that kind of conduct. Yet it is the sort of thing which happens under the regime of the Prime Minister, who is quite unfitted to occupy such a distinguished office, because of his political and moral outlook.

Will the Prime Minister deny that he discussed with Premier Lee the resignation of Senator Ready, or that on Wednesday, the 28th February, Mr. Earle and Senator Ready arrived from Tasmania in the same vessel, and the Prime Minister took Mr. Earle to dinner, Senator Ready coming to Parliament House, where he fainted in the refreshment room, and was taken to the Presidents room. He was taken to the Presidents room, although the President had left the Labour party and Senator Ready was still one of its secretaries, and there were any number of the members of the party who would have been willing to help had anything been the matter with him. Will the Prime Minister deny that Mr. Earle went to Government House and signed his resignation of his Tasmanian seat in the presence of His Excellency the GovernorGeneral? Why did the Prime Minister compromise a high official by getting him to take part, however innocently, in a plot to prolong the life of Parliament? Will he deny that Senator Ready wrote out his resignation in the office of the Minister for Trade and Customs at midday on the day just mentioned? If the Prime Minister denies that, will he explain why, on the 1st March, 1917, he sent to Premier Lee the following cablegram: All arrangements this end complete.

It only touches the fringe of the great matter that ought to concern this Parliament the only matter, indeed, that ought to concern this Parliament and the people of Australia at the present juncture and that is the prosecution of the war. It is a misfortune, only a little short of the result of the last referendum, that we should be discussing a motion of this kind at the present time. I say, therefore, that 1 cannot support the motion; but I shall give, under this motion, a few reasons why, and by reason of the latitude allowed in debate on occasions of this kind, the House should improve the present position.  There is one characteristic of this debate, common, I think, to all the honorable members that have spoken, and that is the distance they have kept away from the particular motion. It is, indeed: significant of shall I call it? the lack of concentration of honorable members opposite that they have gone all round the compass, and discussed such matters as the Taylor card system, the prices of rabbits, and so forth, at a time when Australia is waiting, and waiting impatiently, for a lead on a question that materially, concerns our honour and our very existence. One of the most interesting speeches that we have heard, and one that was successful in regard to the distance that was kept from the subjectmatter of the motion, . was that by the honorable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine) last night. Because that honorable member, in keeping away from the motion, got somewhat near to the particular matter that I have at heart the prosecution of the war I propose to follow him for a few minutes. He spoke about the position in Russia, and argued that revolutions, such as have taken place there, would probably do more to win the war than the armed efforts of the Allies. Let me suggest to the honorable member that if the revolution is going to be carried on by the impractical and absurd methods of those responsible for it, instead of there being a successful winning of the war thereby it may yet assist to rivet the fetters of Prussian absolutism on Democracy. While those revolutionary gentlemen talk with their heads in the clouds, the Prussians are getting through their legs, and establishing a condition of affairs in Russia that may yet act disastrously, not only on that country, but on the whole of the world. That is, indeed, a possible development. When one remembers that all revolutions of a similar character that have taken place have simply set back the hands of the clock of progress in some instances for a hundred years as in the case of the French Revolution then I agree with the honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Archibald), in his insistence on the principle that evolution and order point the only safe way in which humanity can progress. But the honorable member for Barrier, in the course of his interesting address, showed the sources from which he had obtained the political knowledge that he was expounding to lis. He talked, in fact, that kind of political pabulum which has emanated from Germany, and which, as we have every reason to believe now, was concocted for foreign consumption a political pabulum which, being disseminated throughout the world, to the detriment of the cause of the Allies, has been abandoned at the first opportunity by the very people who were responsible for it in Germany those people who are today seeking, in spite of their teachings in regard to Socialism, to aid the Prussian rulers in their onslaught upon freedom.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The hon.orable member for Barrier, as I say, showed the source from which he has obtained his inspiration, by his use of terms that are utterly foreign to Australia terms which practically have no meaning in a country such as this. He talked about the Australian  proletariat. . It is a mere travesty to apply a word of that kind to the masses of Australia. There are no people in the world belonging to the class to which the honorable member refers, who have a better standing, or more control of the political situation, than those referred to by him as the Australian  proletariat. But I know that when he talks in 1hat way he has in his mind heroic pictures of the French revolution. I have no doubt that, in his dreams of youthful ambition, he sees himself, some day or other, standing in a dramatic attitude on a barricade in Collinsstreet, with a red flag in one hand and a bloody sword in the other, waiting for the Australian  proletariat  to bring him the heads of the capitalist magnates of the country. The honorable member for Barrier is, if I may be allowed to say so, a man of considerable intellect and imagination ; and if the picture I have drawn of his mental attitude be a correct one today, I venture also to suggest that in another ten years he will be laughing at the speech he made in the House last night. . The honorable member spoke about landless Australians, and he gave us to understand that there is only one way in which, land can be obtained for the Australian proletariat, namely, by bloody revolution. Does the honorable member realize that the Australian proletariat have only to exercise their votes to get all that even he desires for them? To talk about revolution in a country like Australia is to indicate an intellect obsessed by teachings which are utterly foreign to Australia, and have no real practical relation to the actual conditions of this Commonwealth.  The honorable member gave us his assurance that the war in which we are engaged is a trade war. For the purposes of argument we will admit that such is the case, in the sense, at any rate, in which he puts it, and say that the war has really been caused by a desire for trade by the dominant nations of the world. A burglar has no doubt the same commercial instinct, though somewhat misguidedly he desires to trade in his own way. However, if the honorable member found a burglar in his own house some night, brutally maltreating a child or a mother, in order to stifle their cries, while he went on with his business, I ask how the honorable member would treat him? How is the honorable member prepared to treat the German burglar? Would he leave him severely alone to bayonet old men, outrage women, and starve little children to death 1 I am sure the honorable member would do nothing of the kind ; but that if he. were brought face to face with these horrors he would probably be one of the first to  wade in  with rifle and bayonet. I wish to follow up that question with yet another. After the German burglar has in turn devastated Belgium, France, and Great Britain, is the honorable member for Barrier prepared to stand helplessly by while he arrives in Australia and proceeds to carry into execution here his own particular methods?","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I was surprised to hear during this de bate an effort made in defence of voluntarism. It is, to me, one of the mysteries of the Australian position that nearly every honorable member opposite, while professing the principle of State Socialism, denounces conscription. A fundamental principle of State Socialism is that the interests of the community are greater than those of the individual. And upon that principle State Socialists proceed by compulsion to impose on the individual those necessary duties without which society cannot be maintained and cannot progress. One of the most elementary duties of any society is that of self defence. If compulsion is necessary in lesser matters why in the name of logic and common sense should it be withheld in regard to the allimportant duty of defending ourselves? I have not yet heard any attempted explanation of that anomaly, and am sure I shall wait in vain for it. There is not one honorable member opposite who does not in his heart and soul realize that he occupies a false position in this regard, and that Democracy throughout the world, and in all ages, has imposed upon all its citizens, and must of necessity impose upon them, the one overwhelming obligation of fighting in their own defence. I come now to the more practical phases of this subject, and have a few observations to make concerning the speech to which we listened from the honorable member for South Sydney (Mr. Riley). That honorable member  is a very cheerful optimist. I would remind him that in nature the most cheerful optimist in the face, of danger is the. ostrich. It can put its head in the sand while its tail sticks up high in the horizon, and convince itself that all is well. The honorable member, evidently a student of strategy, has given us assurances that all is well with the Allies. I do not think he went further, however, than to show that we could hold our own against the enemy. If we do no more than that if the war comes to an end with us holding our own and no more then we shall have absolutely failed in regard to every object we had in view when we entered upon the conflict. If peace comes to the world with anything like the present military situation Germany will have absolutely won. It will then be only a matter of a few years in the history of mankind when Germany will reap the fruits of such a peace in a way that will make freedom impossible to Europe and to us in Australia. We are very proud of our victories in Mesopotamia; very well satisfied with the progress made by our. arms in Palestine. But let me remind the House that, having regard to the present position in Europe, Germany is the focus of a new and greater Empire. Germany has, even now, achieved the aim and object of German statesmen and publicists for many years a Middle Europe Empire with a population of 200,000,000, and with resources vastly superior to those of the British Empire. If peace is concluded with a possibility of that* Middle Europe Empire, being maintained, there is an end to the British Empire in the near future, and a challenge indeed to the liberties of the world. The honorable member for South Sydney gave us the assurance that men were not particularly needed; that we had more than enough at the Front. For an answer to that statement we have only to look at the cables in yesterdays newspapers setting out that the Minister for National Service (Sir Auckland Geddes), who is not a military man, impressed upon the House of Commons the absolute necessity for increasing the manpower of the Allies. The message states that this Minister, speaking in the House of Commons on the previous day, said that the question of manpower was  the central problem of the war. The urgent need at the present time is men for the Army. A little further on he is reported to have said,  Our enemies are staking everything on our failure to solve the manpower problem. In the face of these statements in the face of the efforts we know Great Britain is making can we for a moment maintain conscientiously that the Commonwealth has done her full share in regard to the . supply of manpower for the armies of the Allies? I do not think we can. While the proportion of men we have sent to the Front per head of our population is somewhere about 8 per cent., Great Britain has thrown into the  war more than double that percentage. No one can say that our interests in this war and its successful prosecution are less than those, of the Motherland. They are a great deal more, since the very future of Australia hangs in the balance today: This, war, and the part we play in it will determine whether this shall remain a white country, and whether it shall remain a heritage to our children.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When we take into consideration also the efforts that are being made in Great Britain in connexion with the manufacture of munitions and the whole prosecution of the war, then anything Australia has done fades relatively into insignificance. It matters not in the slightest degree whether we have sent five, six, or sixteen divisions. I am surprised that so much time has been devoted to the argument as to whether six or only five divisions were ever projected. Such matters it may suit some honorable members to discuss, but I would remind them that Australias share of credit in regard to the war will be determined, not by ourselves, not by our own feelings of satisfaction, but by the voice of the world at large. While we are twaddling as to the number of men who have been sent to the Front, can we conceal the fact that there are tens of thousands of ablebodied young men thronging our cities, rushing to our racecourses, filling our theatres, while the duty they should be performing is being done for us by others? Can we conceal from the world at large facts like these? And will the world at large regard this Parliament as having done its duty when it is known that we have almost a quarter of a million men who in any other country of the Allies would have been called up for service, but upon whom we as a Parliament have never put the slightest pressure?  A bush fire is a very common occurrence in Australia ; I have seen some dreadful ones. When a bush fire occurs every man in the district, and sometimes every woman who is able to use a beater, is out fighting that fire along so much of its length as human effort can be employed upon. Imagine what would be thought of a farmer who sent out one ablebodied son to fight a bush fire, and told another to stay at home and practice on his fiddle. What would his neighbours say of his action? What help would he get from them when, perhaps, his turn came to call for assistance? Yet that is exactly the position Australia occupies today. One man goes and we allow another to stay at home, if not to play the fiddle, at least to do something more discreditable to his manhood and to Australia. Beyond question we shall be judged in regard to our attitude towards the war by powers outside of Australia, which, to a large extent, will hold our future in the hollow of their hands; and if we do not now acquit ourselves as a branch of the white race in taking up our full responsibilities!, it will be all the worse, if not for U3, then for our posterity. I want now to go back to the causes leading up to the motion now before the House, and at the very outset I wish to dissociate myself absolutely and entirely from the sordid intrigue by which the Prime Minister returned to office after his nominal resignation. I do not desire to discuss it, except to make my position perfectly clear. I have no hesitation whatever in taking up an independent attitude over this matter. I dissent altogether from the contention of the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) that Government pledges also bind members of the party. In my judgment, nothing could be more fatal to effective parliamentary government. We, the members of the National party, had no say whatever in the pledge, and, accordingly, we are free to take up an independent position in regard to it. As one who has always upheld Parliament against the coercion of Ministers, I protest as forcibly as I can against any assumption that because members happen to sit behind a Ministry they must remain silent and refrain from taking any action that will incommode them or seriously threaten their position on the Ministerial benches. In the British House of Commons it has happened time and again that Governments which have made serious mistakes have been displaced by the votes of their own supporters. I regret very much that the cursed party system has fastened itself so strongly upon Australian politics as to make it almost impossible, or at least very difficult, for honorable members to adopt that course which their consciences or judgment may dictate in regard to the conduct of the affairs, of this country. Speaking for myself, I have no hesitation whatever in taking any action in regard to this Government, which, in my judgment, may be necessary, on the present occasion. It will not . be of very much advantage to discuss in detail the events leading up to the present situation. There is/ a wellknown saying, worthy of general acceptance, that we should let bygones be bygones; but, on the other hand, it is our duty, as members of this Parliament, to learn from experience and, if neceessary, to criticise the Government for wrongdoing. It is our duty also, on special occasions to take whatever steps may be necessary to put right any errors they may have committed. I have criticised the Prime Minister on more than one occasion, and there are many phases of this question upon which I feel inclined to speak strongly now; but while I do not shrink in the slightest from the task, I feel under a certain amount of restraint, because, in the first place,t the Prime Minister is not present, and in the second place, it is on account of illness that he is not here. I shall, therefore, confine myself as nearly as possible to those matters upon which there is a certain amount of misconception, and if the Prime Minister, of necessity, comes within the purview of my observations, I want to assure the House that my attitude towards him ia absolutely impersonal. Now, I maintain that the whole series of ghastly blunders that have brought Australia into her present position is due almost entirely to the Prime Minister. From time to time I have made my protests against the blundering way in which the affairs of this country have been conducted since he took office, and I want to protest very strongly indeed against the position he takes up concerning the result of the referendum vote. After we have gone through an experience that has left Australia in the mire of shame and national disgrace, for which he alone was primarily responsible, the Prime Minister now turns round and tells us that it was not the Government, but the people of Australia, who failed. This remarkable statement could only come from a leader lacking conscientiousness and possessed of a very considerable amount of hardihood. The people of Australia, in the first place, did not want these referenda, and did not ask for them. They were imposed upon the electors by the Prime Minister, and they were the outcome of cowardice on the part of the Government, led by the Prime Minister, whose failure to face the situation, and whose thrusting of the responsibility upon the people brought, about the only result that could have been anticipated. As one of the representatives of the solitary State that has not failed, and in view of the succession of blunders perpetrated by the Leader of the Government, from the time that he rounded the men of Australia into those home defence camps down to the day when he imposed the national police force upon Australia for some trumpery reason or other, it is a matter of surprise to me that there should have been a million electors who could still vote in favour of conscription. No other country in the world could have done better than Australia in regard to this matter. The people of this country rose to the occasion as well as could have been expected by any man with a proper conception of human nature and an understanding of the political situation. In every community there is only a certain proportion of people capable of putting patriotism before selfinterests. In every community there are slackers and those who are constitutionally averse to any new proposal, particularly of this kind. I want also to emphasize the point that the vote given at the last referendum was, to a large extent, not a vote against conscription at all. This may seem a strange statement to make, but I contend that tens of thousands of people voted  No, not because they were against conscription, but because they were against the Prime Minister; and, in addition, tens of thousands of people voted  No  because they objected to having this responsibility thrust upon their shoulders by the Prime Minister. I believe a substantial majority would accept conscription readily enough from a Government and Parliament that imposed it upon them, but would vote No every time as a protest against the action of a Government in placing upon the electors the responsibility of deciding the issue. When we remember that the difference between the  Yes  and the  No  votes is represented by only about 4 per cent, of the population, honorable members will see the strength of my contention. We have had an offer from the Prime Minister to stand down if that course of action would lead to effective cooperation of members in the prosecution of this war, and i ask the members of the Opposition to accept it. I quite agree that the presence of the Prime Minister at the head of this Government is detrimental to the effective prosecution of the war by a united Australia. More than that, I say that the internal affairs of the Commonwealth will suffer so long as the Prime Minister remains at the head of any Government. By the violence of his propaganda work in connexion with the, referenda, particularly the latter one, he has brought Australia within measurable distance of civil war. He has created a spirit of bitter antagonism that was foreign to Australia until now, and I believe that it would be a good thing for Australia, not only in regard to the prosecution of the war, but also in regard to the management of our internal affairs, if the Prime Minister were to stand down. He has made an offer to do so, and I ask the Opposition whether it is not their duty under the circumstances, and in the interests of the people they represent, to accept the proposal.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But the offer has been made, and I ask honorable members opposite to take it on its face value, and, at any rate, accept it.  Let me remind honorable members in all earnestness that as a Parliament we have failed up to the present time to give Australia that lead which the people have a right to expect. We have been engaged in party squabbling; we have spent much time on matters that are only remotely * 1 » incidental to the war, and while the great responsibility has been on our shoulders we have in many different ways sought to get rid of it rather than carry it triumphantly forward. We must remember that as members of the Commonwealth Parliament we are making history for Australia, and I am very much afraid that the page of history that we have been writing since the war commenced is blurred and blackened in many respects, and that the verdict of the future historian will not be to our credit. Before that page is finally turned down, and while there is yet an opportunity of writing upon it words that may redeem Australia and the reputation of this Parliament, why should we not seek a way by which we can achieve that worthy object? The Old Book tells us in words many of us dare not forget that God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap. Those words are true not only as regards an individual but also as regards a people, and there is one awful feature of the law that we must never forget, namely, that the reaping of the crop has sometimes to be done by those who were not responsible for the sowing. The sins of the fathers sometimes come upon the children, and the sins of legislators, of the responsible leaders of the people, at times fall upon the innocent, not alone in their own time but also in future ages. Facing such a responsibility I ask honorable members opposite whether they cannot see their way clear to create a condition of affairs in regard to this war that will save our reputation, and preserve Australia for our posterity.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The illustration is a familiar one. We have seen it so often in the columns of the morning papers that we may be pardoned for a suspicion as to the source from which the honorable member drew his inspiration.  I say now, as I have said on the platform many times, that I do not deny the primary duty of a. man to defend himself and his family or his country, but that does not for a moment excuse or justify the attitude of so many persons in this country and outside of it in constantly indulging in passages of semiblasphemous incitement in connexion with a war in which they take no part. We are told that equality of sacrifice is involved in conscription, and an illustration was given by the honorable member for Franklin (Mr.. Mcwilliams), when he pointed out that upon the one side was a family, three of whose members had gone bo the war, and on the other side another family not one member of which had enlisted. Where, he asked, is the equality of sacrifice? And why should not we who are members of Parliament, in safe and fairly lucrative positions, secure as to our posts and emoluments, decide between those two families and force the unwilling one into a course of action we ourselves are not prepared to take? I listened with great interest to the honorable and somewhat chastened member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) on this same subject. I credit him with perfect honesty of purpose. I credit him with consistency to the extent that he has never been afraid to express radical opinions, whatever they might be, either on the platform or in this House; but there has always come a time when he has just failed to vote and act up to the opinions which he has so courageously expressed. Those of us who have been in this House for only a few years will have had sufficient experience to know that he has always just failed to become either a Higinbotham or a Higgins because he has never had the courage to drag himself away from his party and press supports, and to vote up to the views which he so strongly holds. Everybody, admits the unanswerable logic of his arguments in connexion with the proposed amendments of the Constitution, and everybody is familiar with the fact that at the last moment he has weakly failed to put into operation the principles in which he has expressed his belief. I dare say that I will be considered offensive, though I do not mean to be, when I say that the honorable gentleman, in regard to this war, expresses what I conceive to be perfect Prussianism. I do not use that expression iu any offensive or abusive sense whatever. The honorable gentleman possesses honesty of purpose, and a. true sense of patriotism as he sees it. I believe, also, that in the distinctly panGermanic way in which he disregards and despises the temperamental differences between men, which leads him to disregard and despise those spiritual elements in human nature which make it impossible to drive men en masse into the same course of action, he assaults, without knowing, or intending it, the very bases of Christianity itself. That is why he believes he is right as do many others with him in saying that our country is threatened. He has honest convictions. We are told that a foreign enemy is assailing us, and as members of this Parliament, which controls the people of this country, we are entitled to throw them into the breach just as we would throw shrapnel or bullets, or as we would drive our bayonets or other material things. We are invited to hurl masses of men into this cauldron of destruction without consulting either their temperaments or their desires. There we have perfect Prussianism. That is exactly the set of principles, the set of views, the outlook and the ideals against which we are alleged to be fighting.

This Christian gentleman, for whom I entertain a great respect, said something about whether or not we shall surrender the German colonies as part of the peace terms into which we shall ultimately enter. As he has been permitted to discuss the matter, I presume that . I shall be allowed to make a passing reference to it. I ask him and honorable members opposite to try and understand the differences which separate them from those upon this side of the chamber. I ask them to say whether this is a war for annexation, or whether it is not. Let us put the question to ourselves,  Was or was not increased territory for the British Empire one of the grounds upon which we entered the war? and a million voices will proclaim the fact that we never entered it for a motive so base. We entered it to serve those high ideals which are rapidly being undermined by Prussianism in our own country. We entered the war to sustain those high ideals, to sustain the principle of right against might, of Democracy against autocracy and militarism, of treaties which should be inviolable. But we had not gone far into the struggle before the cloven hoof disclosed itself, and we found somebody in another place submitting a resolution affirming that we shall not lay down our arms until we have added something to a territory like Australia, which is already larger than we can manage or occupy. That sort of patriotism is cheap very cheap. The inflexibility of which suburban mayors speak at local banquets is very cheap. This war is not being carried on by politicians, or by members of the Ministry, many of whom being eligible for military service have repeatedly promised to play their part in it and have just as repeatedly failed to honour their promissory notes. These are the Micawbers of compulsion. This war is being carried on, not merely by the brave boys who are fighting at the Front, but by the women and children, the aged and infirm of this country. When we speak of our inflexible resolution to carry on this war, sitting in soft places in this Parliament, receiving our emoluments and increasing our emoluments for doing the same work as we did previously, we forget that it is the women and children, the aged and invalid, who are bearing the brunt of the struggle everywhere. In Britain, surrounded as she is by those cursed engines of militarism, the submarines the productions of companies from which our own people have been drawing dividends in the past people are being starved. But who are being starved? Think you, it is our political leaders? Think you, it is the neurotic patriotic British aristocracy? Think you, it is the persons who have shouted loudest that we are boys of the bulldog breed? Not for a moment. The persons who are being starved in Britain are again the women and children, the invalid and the aged.

They will have their small beer and good Rhine wine ad lib. Reaching the charmed circles of Prussian diplomacy? Not at all. None of its members will suffer.

There is far too much tendency on the part of men, who, not having been born in this country, possess none of the instincts of true Australians, to decry the position taken up by Australia in connexion with this war. We have, it is said, enjoyed the protection of the British Navy. Hypothetically, that is quite true. Probably it is quite true. But the fact remains that 12,000 miles from the seat of war, unattacked, unviolated, and unthreatened, there have either gone from this country or there have volunteered to go, little less than 500,000 souls out of a small population of 5,000,000.

Having accepted the conditions under which it was rendered not only possible, but also inevitable, it behoves us to stand by our Allies and our fellow Australians who have gone to fight this war beyond the seas.

Although many Governments have failed in the judgment of the people of Australia and that judgment has been doubtless right the present Government enjoys the unique distinction of being the only one in history, to my knowledge, which is at once a selfconfessed and self demonstrated failure. Ministers came into office declaring that nothing mattered but the war and the winning of the war. They went on to the .Treasury bench declaring that their sole object was to give effect to a policy .of winning the war. They declared that voluntarism had failed, and they passed a measure of taxation designed to buttress up the wealthy in this country, and secure them their dividends, and another measure which was a penal tax for the purpose of doing by an indirect method of legislation what they were fearful of doing, and dared not do, by the direct method of legislation, namely, penalizing men who had not gone to the war. That was their record in regard to winning the war. They said,  While we claim the right to commandeer the lives and properties of the young men of this country, our policy is to secure 7 per cent, to the wealthy capitalists. Life, blood, and all from the working soldier; the full reward for capital on the gilded investments of the capitalists who had no intention of fighting ! That was their policy. They said that they had failed to get recruits by what they were pleased to call the voluntary method. If a chorus of voices, all affirming the same thing from their own experience, could be taken as a proof that voluntarism had failed, then, according to Ministers and every member of their party, the policy of securing recruits by voluntarism had failed. It was that fact which drove them to the referendum, and, having gone to the referendum, they said,  We are depending, as a last and only resource, upon this method of obtaining recruits. This is our winthewar policy. Nothing else matters. This, and this alone, is the policy by which we can win the war. This was, as the Prime Minister called it, their  Rock of Ages. They said,  We want you to understand that, unless we have this power, unless you give us this power, we cannot! govern this country, and we will not attempt to do so. The country rejected them with contumely and with contempt, according to all accepted standards of responsible government. They not only voted Ministers out they threw them out, and their whole policy with them. Yet Ministers come to the House today, and say,  We are not defeated; we are here. Waving both arms in the air, and with a smile suffusing his countenance, the Prime Minister said,  We are here. That is your trouble. In one sense, as lawyers would say, the Ministry is a virgo intacta amongst Ministries. Ministers have not been turned out. Can I be shown one member who has lost his seat as the result of the referendum ?

The taking of a referendum is an executive act which should not affect the life of a Government, and it was a most improper course of procedure on the part of the present Ministers, on the recent appeal to the people, to deliberately weight the scales with threats or promises. Although I know that the great majority of this country are irrevocably committed against the policy of conscription, I realize also that there were some thousands, nevertheless, who were led on by that aureole hue of hope that by voting in the negative they would forever get rid of Hughesism in all its forms. Notwithstanding that fact, it was an improper thing to load the scales on an appeal to the people of this kind. Nothing could make the question vital to the Ministry but their own deliberate act.  The terms of the motion moved by my leader include, three specific charges brought against the Government, and the first charge relates to the repudiation of pledges by the Prime Minister and other members of the Government. One would think that such an allegation was sufficiently definite and sufficiently serious to merit a definite and serious reply. My leader stood in the position of Crown Prosecutor. If I may be permitted to use a somewhat sinister metaphor, the Government stood in the position of a man in the dock. Serious charges were levelled against them ; the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Tudor) collated the evidence in support of those charges, and he did not go beyond nor stop short of the material facts necessary to sustain them. What did the Prime Minister say in reply? The honorable member for Yarra comes up and makes charges against me, but he says nothing about the battle on the Isonzo Front; nothing about the Russian revolution, or the altitude of the Bolsheviks, the Ukranians, or the Cossacks ; and nothing about the . position on the Western Front. The right honorable gentleman might also have said with equal truth and potency that the Leader of the Opposition had said nothing about the procession of the equinoxes, or about an eclipse, though heaven knows a reference to an eclipse would have been relevant enough. All that the honorable member for Yarra did was to confine himself to the cold and formal language of a serious personal and political indictment. Certainly it was very unkind of him, and it drew from the Prime Minister the rejoinder that the honorable member had dealt with things infinitely petty and infinitely mean. Maybe the honorable member was right. He was dealing with the personal reputation of the Prime Minister. Perhaps the right honorable gentleman adequately assessed it as something infinitely petty and infinitely mean and, no doubt, also an infinitely painful task on the part of one who has a larger measure of Christian charity towards delinquents than I could ever lay claim to. Nevertheless, although it was a matter of that kind, he dealt with it in the way I have described in the cold and formal language of a person making out a cruel, hard case, but one which, in the interests of political decency in this country, had to be made. The Prime Ministers answer was,  I am here. We are here. That is your trouble. It is our trouble; it is not a trouble that we have brought upon ourselves, or to which we have been a party, or at which we have connived ; but everything which debases the public life of this country debases, to some extent, the reputation of every citizen of this country. To that extent it is our trouble. That is why we have launched this motion, and will support it to a man. For just one moment let me reexamine the facts which have been examined from other aspects by other honorable members on both! sides of the House. I do not intend to repeat the collated evidence to which I have already referred, amassed with crushing conclusiveness by the various members on this side of the House. Sufficient for my indictment are the words spoken at Bendigo I tell you plainly that the Government must have this power. It cannot govern the country without it. It will not attempt to do so. Those words were uttered in circumstances of extraordinary solemnity, and in an extraordinary solemn manner, and they were uttered more than once in effect. They were uttered, it is true, in the presence of the numerous band of claqueurs, and hangers on, and boosters up, who followed the Prime Minister around this country, and who, in one way or another, contributed to those nauseating columns that rendered the morning papers of the time even more painful than usual. They were uttered, it is true, to persons of that kind, but they were uttered also to seriousminded men and women. They were uttered to men whose sons were fighting at the front; they were uttered to tearstained women hanging on his lightest word and believing that his lightest word might be accepted at its face value. They were uttered in the presence of hundreds of .people who realize that this country and the world today is bathed in blood by reason of the fact that in the centre of Europe a man repudiated his pledge. That is the fount and origin of this war, and if I am expected to cynically disregard the seriousness of the position that has been created in this House, I tell you that I have no intention to make myself a party to this debasement. Although my name in politics may sing very small indeed to future generations, my reputation is still worth something ,to me, and if in a hundred  years there be any readers of the forgotten tomes associated with this House they will find that I at least stood up in protest with other men against a deliberate act of falsehood, in the presence of tragic circumstances of unexampled importance, on the part of the chief political representative of Australia. Then followed that petty jugglery which we saw, that procession backwards and forwards to a certain place the pro . cess of in again, out again, as my humorous friend from Henty rightly terms it. There was nothing then about the position on the Isonzo front; there was no concern then for some days about the relative importance of the Bolsheviki and other persons in Russia. There was a continuous movement backwards and forwards, to see how the Government could get rid of the pledge, or shunt it from one to another, in order that the odium of it might be transferred or at least distributed. It does not need a very vivid imagination to picture what happened. The Government met. The first thing they said was;  What are we to do about it? The position is difficult; we ought to resign ; we are in honour bound to resign, and everybody here knows that we are not going to resign.  Hear, hear, from the PostmasterGeneral.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[6]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Honorable members will see what a happy position that placed the Government in. The Government went away and said to one another, The party tells us we must do it in the only honorable way open to us, subject to the fact that we must not do it in the only honorable way possible.  Therefore, they said,  having been to the party, we will go to the GovernorGeneral. Honorable members know what happened. The Government came down to the House, and the Prime Minister placed on the table a memorandum. I am very glad to know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the Speaker has not taken the view which I thought, from casual observations on his part, he intended to take, that the memorandum was not a subject for discussion in this House. I was quite prepared to move that his ruling be disagreed with if he had contended that a memorandum submitted for the consideration of the House, and to influence the deliberations of the House, could not be discussed. It appears now that we may discuss it, subject only to the fact that we must make no reflection on the GovernorGeneral. That is a limitation which I readily accept, and beyond which I have not the slightest intention of going. There is probably no precedent in the history of constitutional government in Australia for a Prime Minister endeavouring to prop up himself and his brother decadent politicians by using the name of the GovernorGeneral. It is obvious that the memorandum is a fit subject for discussion. It does the Prime Minister little credit on the contrary, it is well in keeping with his conduct throughout these negotiations to enable him to retain his office to put words into the mouth of the GovernorGeneral for the purpose of propping up his position here. Nobody will be in the least deceived. Every line in that memorandum, from beginning to end, is a Hughesian effusion, and the only difference between it and a speech by the Right Honorable William Morris Hughes is that the right honorable gentleman thought he could evade discussion and criticism by associating the name of the GovernorGeneral with it.

He had nothing whatever to do with the pledges made by the Leader of the Government. That was a matter for the Prime Ministers own conscience. The GovernorGeneral had to satisfy himself whether the Prime Minister was a person who was likely to be able to lead a party and a Government to carry on the work of the House. He had to satisfy himself whether the Prime Minister was the kind of man who would swallow his promises in order to retain office, and he has shown his good judgment, because the Prime  Minister is prepared to swallow his promises in order to keep office.  The work of Parliament is going on, and the GovernorGeneral is justified, because his sole concern is to see that he gets a leader who can carry on the work of this Parliament and control a majority in the Parliament. The right honorable gentleman can do it, and is doing it. He has his party behind him, and they have not the courage to repudiate him, and apparently he knew it. There is the whole position in a nutshell. It is not the business of the GovernorGeneral to inquire into the minds of honorable members here, or to consider the wild and whirling election protestations and the futile promises, made to win support for a losing case of honorable members on the platform.

I am glad of the opportunity suggested by the interjection to say frankly that I have no personal animus against the Prime Minister. I am one of the few members of the House who were intimately associated with him personally and privately. I have partaken of his hospitality in considerable measure, and have endeavoured in some small way to return it. I enjoyed his friendship, and looked upon his career as a stimulus and an inspiration for my own. He was a man in whose company I found pleasure, and for whom I had a great admiration. But, after the outbreak of war and his visit to England, he became infected and inflamed with the germs of Imperial jingoism, which have destroyed many able men before. His condition became worse every day until he was caught up with a certain fanaticism, and now believes himself entitled to do anything to secure his ends. It has fallen to the lot of few men in history, and of no other man in Australian history, to do so much injury to a country as he has done to this. Not only has he done Australia political injury by the abandonment of his friends and his principles, but by his conscription proposals and his political speeches he has so misrepresented the Democracy of this country as to traduce and vilify it before the whole civilized world, being helped in this by the notoriety which his Tory Imperialist propaganda in Great Britain enabled him to enjoy. Not only has he done this gross public wrong to Australia, but by his abortive attempts to seize the bodies of the citizens and violate the homes of the people of this country, he has brought apprehension and sorrow to the hearts, not only of the ordinary citizens, but even to those who have had sons killed at the war or fighting at the Front. They, like others, have been afraid that this policy of violation and spoliation would at last reach them.  I come now to the second count of my leaders indictment against the Prime Minister, which deals with the persecutions the honorable member for Yarra rightly preferred that word to prosecutions of public men; a very serious matter, on which I propose to speak seriously.

We pointed this out to the magistrate, and the barrister who appeared to prosecute graciously I use the word advisedly consented to apply for an adjournment, because, as he said,  You cannot do so. Only the prosecutor could obtain an adjournment in these cases. This case was therefore put off until the Tuesday. The defendant was charged with having made false statements regarding the vote of the soldiers at the Front. The authorities probably thought that we would make no defence, and pay a fine, but we were determined to prove the truth of what had been said by calling for the records of this House, and bringing as witnesses returned soldiers whom we knew had important information on the subject. But we knew that we could not fight the case to a finish adequately unless we got an adjournment, and our application for the adjournment needed was strenuously opposed. But the police magistrate on the bench, after reading the regulation, said that  as it was contrary to natural justice he must disregard it, and a leader of the Bar, in putting the same view, said that it amounted to a direction to the Court as to how it should try the case. Consequently we obtained an adjournment in spite of and in breach of this iniquitous regulation, and ultimately gained the acquittal of the lady. In probably a dozen instances the Crown charged persons with making false statements; but to my knowledge in only one case was a conviction secured, and even that is the subject of an. appeal. Nothing of the kind has ever happened in this country before. The Crown were so weak in their cases and so wicked in their desire to prosecute, that they haled defendant after defendant before the Court, and yet, in every instance but one, failed to prove their case.

Not only is that law improper and inequitable ; not only is it in essence weighted against the defendant, but, .if anything could be worse than that, this is made worse by the fact that the Government would not prosecute except in the case of charges made against their political opponents. That is a very grave charge. It is worthy of a serious answer from the Government, and it should be answered also by the party opposite, because it goes to the very base of British justice. If what I have said is true, and I shall prove it, it amounts to a prostitution of British justice. One could hardly make a stronger statement than that.  Let me give honorable members one illustration in proof of what I say. The Prime Minister in proceeding up, and down this country, spitting venom and vituperation wherever he went, dividing the people, and promoting recrimination and illfeeling, calling out the police here and creating new* police there, and making violent Imperialistic and jingoistic speeches dividing families and unmaking friendships, referred to three things more frequently than to anything else, namely, Sinn Fein, Industrial Workers of the World, and a certain ecclesiastic, who got on his nerves, and apparently afterwards got on his chest. His greatest trouble was the question of Sinn Fein. I am bound to say in passing that the right honorable gentleman knows as much about Sinn Fein as does the honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Archibald), and that is making a pretty strong statement to indicate his want of knowledge of the subject. There was a meeting held in the Guild Hall, in Melbourne. This hall is leased to the Womens Political Association.

These are matters which rest on principle, and not on expediency. They can not be waived aside by. the argument of military necessity, because that is a sinister argument which should not be readily used, and has been invoked elsewhere. We are under an obligation to every lawabiding enfranchised white citizen of the country to give him equal rights in the government of the country. We cannot with impunity tear up the  scrap of paper  or disregard our guarantees. If we do tear up the  scrap of paper  and disregard our guarantees in the future, as the Government have done in the past, we shall set up conditions here, as I have said already, which are not worth fighting for or defending. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Watt), at least, might have been expected to know better. He is a champion of the Australian Natives Association, in connexion with which he has won some honour, and he has prided himself on his radical leanings and democratic ideals. Yet he weakly followed in the wake of that imported gentleman, the Prime Minister, who, in this matter, does no credit to the gallant country from which he came to find an asylum in Australia. In assisting in that! act of gross injustice to his fellow Australians, the honorable member was guilty of .pusillanimity and disregard for the rights of his fellow countrymen which disqualifies him absolutely as a good Australian.  We are asked what we are going to do in the. future what we are going to do with regard to the offer that has been made to us by the Prime Minister if it is an offer. I wish to tell the party opposite something for the good of their souls. When I noticed the remarkable difference between their studied politeness of today, and their militant aggressiveness of a few weeks ago, I naturally asked myself the reason. I see the party opposite occupying a position not unlike that of the small boy who has been conducted to the nursery by his parent, and has returned after disciplinary exercises looking for a soft place to sit down. They have just had such corrective measures meted out to them. They have whirled about the country as the mouthpieces of vituperation and vindictiveness ^vilifying, not only the party on this side, but also the majority of the people of the country, Having been whipped, scorched, and defeated, they came back into the House meek as sucking doves, their leader bearing meekly a small olive branch to the party on this side. We would like to respond in a way which we think would be the best, not necessarily for this party, but for the country as a whole. I, therefore, ask the party opposite to seriously reconsider their .past conduct, and, above all, to consider the vote of the people at the referendum. If they can bring their conduct more into keeping with the aspirations of the majority of the people, as shown in that vote, I think we might, not as members of a Ministry they may form, but with moderate harmony if I may so express it carry on together the work of the country. But there must be reformation. First of all, it is perfectly idle for the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) to ask what we are going to do in the future, seeing that his most generous admission is1 that we cannot do anything with conscription at present. That honorable member, with a lethal weapon in one hand behind his back, tenders his olive branch with the other. Let honorable members opposite dismiss every notion from their minds tha* the party on. this side, either directly or indirectly, can be associated in any kind of friendly intercourse with a Ministry which has even for its ulterior object a policy of compulsion. Let the Government and their supporters get that into their minds as a preliminary, and then set to work in connexion with the war. I have two alternative policies. My two policies are not by any means incompatible. One is the policy indorsed by the Trade Union Conference of Great Britain and by the Labour Councils of New South Wales and Victoria, and that policy is to use all legitimate means, as a Dominion of the Empire, to influence the centre of the Empire in common with those Democrats who, at the heart of the Empire, are striving for the same thing to bring this fearful fratricidal war to an end by negotiation. That is the first plank; but if we cannot be wholly successful with that immediately, let us in the meantime, as we must do our full measure of justice to the soldiers at the Front, get to work. Let us understand that we are not going to improve the position by speeches by the employment of men to make abusive speeches about slackers or by securing to wealth more than its full reward, while at the same time proposing to take the all, which includes the life of the private soldier and the worker. Then let honorable members opposite get out of their minds, once and for all, the notion that we can materially increase the number which this country is sending across the seas. We cannot do that by any means; on the contrary, it is inevitable that the number must still further decrease as the war goes on. We cannot get more out of the bucket than there is in it.

So far as the Ministry itself is concerned, it is perfectly hopeless to think of improving the position when your leaders are unsatisfactory to the Commonwealth. Having regard to the vote at the recent referendum, and the many and significant evidences of dissatisfaction on the part even of, those who voted in the affirmative, it must be realized that there is a profound distrust of the Government. Right or wrong, that seems to be perfectly obvious. It is idle to say this is a personal question. One might just as well say,  Here is an army going to fight, having at its head a leader whom the whole army and the country distrust. But what matters it who the leader is ! The cause we are fighting for is the only consideration. It is clear that, in circumstances of that kind, the first act of wise statesmanship would be to remove the commander who had not the confidence of those who had to work under and with him. That applies to this Government. It is, indeed, the first consideration. Without presuming to speak for our party, but as one who knows the tone and temper of it, I think that honorable members on this side of the House are very far from desiring to be associated in Ministerial office with any one on the Government side of the House.

That, of course, is quite wrong. Speaking for myself, even if I am an extremist, I shall, at all events, place no obstacle in the way of a rapprochement of the kind suggested by the honorable member. I have told the House the first essential to the success of such an effort. When I talk of a change of Government, I speak not so much because of the reasons I have been putting forward as to why the present Government should be censured, but because I feel certain that the main outstanding fact, quite irrespective of anything I have said, is that the people no longer consider the Prime Minister and his Ministry proper persons to lead the House at this time.  The next consideration is as to how we are to deal with the question of raising recruits. I have already said that, in my opinion, nothing the Government may do will largely increase the numbers. I am not a pessimist; but, to my mind, what we have already done is marvellous. Doubtless, a more harmonious feeling amongst the people, a greater cooperation, and a cessation of much of the present party bitterness would improve the recruiting situation; but my own view is that we should best face the situation by means of sacrifices on the part of those in this country who are capable of making sacrifices. We are all capable of making sacrifices in one way or another. Let us make them. Let us, as members of this House, set an example to the country. Let Ministers set an example of personal sacrifice of material things. Every one of us, as an example to the country could and should do so. We could then go to the financiers and capitalists of this country so that we might improve the lot of the soldier and his dependants. We might then improve the condition of soldiers dependants in the matter of separation allowances. We might then wipe away the feeling existing in the minds of so many thousands of the people that the dependants of soldiers are not getting a fair deal; that our soldiers themselves are not receiving the fullest measure of justice; that there is altogether too much care on the part of the present Government and many of their supporters to buttress up the material interests of this country, while paying little attention to the just claims of those who are making the real sacrifice, both in Australia and beyond it.

However, I have great confidence in Senator Millen, who is now administering the Repatriation Department. I know his ability, and I believe that he has thrown himself earnestly into the work of repatriation, and so I am hoping that very shortly we shall have in operation a scheme that will give satisfaction to the people of Australia.  This repatriation scheme, as I have said, was formulated just before the decision to hold another referendum was announced, and therefore it could not be examined by the general public and the soldiers who were returning to these shores. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that if the Government had had time to finalize the details, and if returning soldiers had had an opportunity of examining it, we would have had a bigger vote in favour of conscription, not only from the soldiers, but from their friends and the general public as well. The time of holding the referendum was inopportune also because it was right in the middle of the harvest, when people were particularly busy, and worse than all, as I pointed out when the first proposal was announced, Parliament, which was elected by the people to. do the work of the country, was asking them to decide how this work should be done. I have always objected to referendums, and more particularly on a proposal such as this, and that is why I thought a change of Administration would be for the good of Australia. A referendum on conscription appealed to every vile and ungenerous instinct. It appealed to every selfish, sordid, and mercenary interest to the pettifogging pacifist, who cares for nothing but his own miserable interests it appealed, also, to the selfish employer or employee who cared for nothing so long as profitable occupation was insured.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[8]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Even the girls were appealed to. I saw a circular issued in my own State telling the girls that 6,000 of our boys who had gone to the Front had been married at Home, and the girls were invited to contemplate what would be their future prospects in the matrimonial market if conscription were carried. The mothers, too, were told that if they entered the polling booth and voted Yes, they would leave with the brand of Cain upon them. These were the influences responsible for the  No  vote.  I want it to be distinctly understood that I, for one, refuse to believe that the big proportion of people of Australia are disloyal. 1 believe, however, that they have been led by false advisers, and I know that a big effort was made to stir up sectarian trouble, notwithstanding the splendid response by the Catholic community to the call of the Empire. There are over 350 boys names on the honour roll of the Christian Brothers College at Perth, which is only a young college, and the same can be said of a great many other Catholic institutions; but, unhappily, there have been in our midst those who, in the words of Monsignor Cassidy, out of disloyalty to Aus tralia would stab at the heart of England through the souls of their own sons. 1 have nothing but contempt for people who would do that sort of thing. The trouble today seems to be due, to a great extent, to political antagonism to the Prime Minister. I do not think that, after the pledge made by the Leader of the Government at Bendigo, members of the Government are absolved by their recent course of action ; but, when considering how I shall vote on this motion, I must ask myself what is offering to me in the choice of Governments. In this connexion I have been waiting patiently for an answer to the suggestion made for the formation of a Coalition Government. If we turn down the Prime Minister, are we to get the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) ? The honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) today referred to the present Government as a limpet Ministry, because of the manner in which they were hanging on to office.

For that reason, I should like to see all parties combine so that we might have a guarantee that no one section of the community would be treated unfairly. If we are satisfied that the war is a just and honorable one, let us, like the people in the Old Country, do all that possibly can be done to bring it to a successful conclusion. We in Australia have a big prize to fight for. Only a few years ago we were at death grips with the South African Republics. Today they are fighting with us. Surely the response of those Republics to the generous treatment they received from their conquerors is a marvellous tribute to the farsighted conceptions of liberty of those who are building up our Empire.  What harm could conscription do to Australia? At the commencement of the war it was anathema to the people of Great Britain, but today it is in operation there as it .is in New Zealand, Canada, and the great and democratic United States of America. America had not entered the war a week before a measure for the enforcement of conscription was before Congress. During the recent campaign I was addressing a meeting at Northampton, in Western Australia, and on the platform were two returned soldiers, one a man of sixtythree years of age, who had served for a little over two and a half years, and the other a boy of nineteen, who had enlisted when he was seventeen years of age, and had returned a cripple. We talk about Democracy, equality of opportunity, and equality of sacrifice; but surely the present system of getting soldiers is undemocratic and unfair. Honorable members opposite say that they will not submit to conscription, but they must realize the dangers and injustices which arise every day out of the existing system. Will they not then meet us to a certain extent?

My honorable friends opposite, being hardheads politically, realized that it would be a capital cry upon which to go to the country. It implied, not merely that they were the  Winthewar  party, but that their opponents constituted the  Losethewar  party.

The position is that when the Prime Minister gave the pledge which he did, he meant it, because he thought he was going , to carry the referendum. He gave it with a view to inducing electors who were anticonscriptionists to vote in favour of conscription under the threat that if they did not they would be afflicted with something worse, namely, the Labour party. Had he not given that pledge, I firmly believe that conscription would have been lost by another 100,000 votes. Dozens of men and women told me that they were not in favour of conscription, but that they were  not going to have our lot. There is no doubt that that was exactly the impression which the Prime Minister sought to convey. When he gave that pledge people thought that he meant to respect it. Yet today the same Government are in power. They were irrevocably pledged not to carry on the government of this country in the absence of conscription. Yet the people rejected conscription. As the Government have said they could not carry on without conscription, and could not reinforce the men at the Front by any. other means, I wish to know by what method they intend to reinforce them now ? During eighteen months of the two years that T assisted in the recruiting campaign, I was ashamed of the men who spoke from the recruiting platforms, because they were practically talking conscription all that time. They were doing so at the time when we were getting more recruits than we could supply with caps. They were doing so at a time when we were obliged to accommodate our troops on the show grounds and in cattle pens. Thousands of men have been buried at the Front who were called coldfooters in the days of which I speak. Do not honorable members realize that the continual upbraiding of men because they will not do a certain thing steels their resolution to refrain from doing it 1 Let me quote an example. Near where I live there used to exist a  push  of young fellows, nine of whom had evaded compulsory training. The war broke out, and within seven weeks every one of those young men had enlisted under the voluntary system. Four of them have since been killed on active service, and the remainder have been returned to Australia maimed.  That circumstance evidences the Australian spirit.

I make the deliberate charge against those who first conceived the idea of establishing conscription in Australia that they mooted it for the purpose of spoiling voluntarism not because the blanks could not be filled by the voluntary system, but because certain people would have conscription. I am willing to concede that hundreds of thousands believe conscientiously that the system of conscription should be imposed in Australia, but the great majority of those who support, the principle of compulsion, particularly those Conservatives who first mooted it, have a political and an industrial motive. For one thing they raised the cry for it at a time when more recruits were coming forward than could be accommodated in the training camps. I speak as one who recruited with the best of them at that time. At a meeting held at Brighton in July, 1915, there were several speakers, including an individual called Snowball, who lies like a trooper. Mr. Adamson, M.L.C., could not be present, but he forwarded a written apology, in which he said that if he had been able to attend the meeting he would have advocated conscription as the only way in which to get men.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[9]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If during the two referenda campaigns it had been said that because certain families had given their all and some families had given none to our Forces, one might have understood the demand for conscription, but the plea put forward was that we were not getting enough men for the Front.  The Government said that they* would not. and could not, carry on unless conscription was in force. Why then do they not go out ? They have created considerable bitterness amongst the very men whom they want to enlist. Just fancy the honorable member for Grey (Mr. Poynton), who, like myself, is too old to go to the Front, seeking to compel others to go. He has the infernal impudence to ask that others should be compelled to go while he and I stay at home and draw our salaries. I could understand the honorable member and others asking men to fight for them, but it is a very different proposition to make men go away to fight for them. It is somewhat .like the attitude taken up by the Shah of Persia. When he was in England, he witnessed a review of the volunteer army, and said that on his return to Persia he would establish one, and when the Prince of Wales, afterwards King Edward VII., said to him,  Supposing they will not volunteer, what will you do? he said, I will make them. In my opinion it is not possible to get 5,000 recruits a month as things are in Australia today, but I throw the onus for that state of affairs on honorable members opposite, and on those who wanted conscription; because the moment they commenced to talk conscription they embittered the whole of those who might have been induced to volunteer. The honorable member for Indi (Mr. Leckie), who is Chairman of the State Recruiting Committee, and Mr. Donald Mackinnon, the DirectorGeneral of Recruiting, endeavoured to restrain any talk of conscription at recruiting meetings, but it was impossible to prevent some men from talking it. We had the regrettable experience of hearing returned soldiers speaking from recruiting platforms, and expressing doubt as to the chastity of women who would walk with men who did not enlist, and we heard them making use of language too . strong for repetition. After an outburst of oratory, after placing the position before the people in an able manner, showing the acuteness of the situation at Home and the scarcity of recruits, they felt quite insulted and injured because men did not rush on te the platform, and enlist to fight for 6s. a day for those who are making millions. That was where the trouble started. They embittered those whom they might have enlisted, men who were the flesh and blood and relations of those who had already gone away in their thousands. The men who went away in 1915 were called coldfooters. The men who went away in 1916, and who have died in their thousands, were also called  coldfooters. Some of the men who are now enlisting are called  coldfooters. We all understand the position in Australia today. It has been brought about by honorable members opposite, and there will be no change while they remain in office. That the people distrust them is proved by the manner in which their system of conscription has been rejected. Since the 5th May last, when the general election took place, the Government have not attempted to extract money from the profiteers in Australia in order to pay for the war. The revenue of £3,500,000, which the honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) proposed to raise from the taxation of excess profits, and the £2,000,000 that the honorable member for Grey (Mr. Poynton) proposed to levy the honorable member admitted that he had whittled the tax down too low, and said that if he had his way it would not have been brought down, because he recognised the field for taxation excess profits presented and the necessity for the revenue was cut down to £450,000 by the present Treasurer (Sir John Forrest). That is another reason why recruits cannot be secured. There is no equality of sacrifice, and there is no intention to make the wealthy people pay their share. Again, in 1914 the Government undertook to pay the private soldier 6s. per day, with 4£d. for each child it was a disgrace and 10s. separation allowance for the wife. That scale stood for three years, but as the purchasing power of the sovereign since 1914 has decreased by 33 per cent., let us increase the soldiers pay, so that he and his dependants may live, and let us make the profiteers pay for it, not the workers. If one dares to disagree with what the Government desire in regard to the war, or dares to be an anticonscriptionist, he is told that he is a proGerman, and is in receipt of German gold. Such talk hurts. AntiJingoists and anticapitalists that is what we are. Yet on every platform men said of us, You are proGermans, knowing all the time that they were lying.

The value of the mineralproducing districts of Longwy and Briey (France) was £150,000,000, which represented the cost of the war for only twentyfive days.  The idea of taking colonies, Dr. Dernburg proceeded, was equally illusory. Germanys capital outlay upon her colonies before the war produced only £5,000,000 a year, which was the cost of the war for a day, from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. General disarmament was essential.

I was doing too well at my meetings. My handsome face drew the crowd.  Now the honorable member has mentioned it, I will describe the methods of the Government prosecutions, every one of which I dare say was as foolish as was my own prosecution. I happened to be in Maryborough the day before His Majesty the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) attended there. Fancy the Duke of Melbourne Ports having the impertinence to appear in a town before His Majesty the Minister for Defence! I evidently did very well at Maryborough, but Senator Pearce reached there next day, and did very badly. He came back to Melbourne, and had a summons delivered on my wife when I was 300 miles up country. He was my witness, but he cleared out to Western Australia. Honorable members have heard the honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) on the legal aspects of the regulation under which I was prosecuted; but I ask everybody in this House, or outside of it, what sort of treatment is it to mete out to any man to leave a summons at his house, after taking good care, by telephoning and making inquiries at the door, that he was away ? The particular individual iO whom the summons was delivered was my  lump of love.

I tried to reach my house by telephone, because I knew the summons would cause a little trouble in the  dovecot  at home, but I could not. I had to appear before the Court at Maryborough as a criminal, without a lawyer to defend me, and against evidence brought up by the Defence Department, which was represented hy one of the leading lawyers of the country. That was a nice position for a poor, innocent Labour man. I was summoned because I said that the Minister for Defence had endeavoured as early as November, 1914, to secure the formula for the manufacture of steel for shrapnel shell, and could not get it.  Honorable members have heard me make that statement in the House on two or thine occasions.

It was headed by Mr. Dan Gray, of Gray Brothers, and we saw the Minister, but the Minister said it was user less for him to receive the deputation, because he had not the formula. This was about March or April, 1915. He said he had been trying Lo get it since November.. 1914, but he added,  The formula is the secret of the large firms who manufacture this particular stel. He told us so himself, and the private firms agreed, knowing that they had secret formulae themselves. He also told me that Mr. Hugh V. McKay, who was coming from the Old Country, via America, would bring a formula with him from America. Evidently it could not be got in Great Britain. I enlarged upon the enormity of the situation that while the Government were trying to compel men to go to fight and die, other men were not compelled to give up their secret formula? for the benefit of the nation. I was summoned for saying it, on the ground that the statement was prejudicial to conscription. The issue narrowed itself down to the question whether the British Government or the private firms owned the formula. The Minister for Defence told me himself that it was held by the private firms. The Defence Departments witnesses gave evidence in the Court that it was the British Government that held it. We knew the British Government had no laboratories before the war for inventions or discoveries. They may have had a standard of steel, but it was not their secret. The Government alleged that I made a false statement when I said the formula was the property of private firms, and the Minister for Defence, who caused me to be summoned, cleared out to Western Australia. That was the treatment meted out to men who dared to oppose the Government on the conscription question.  The Prime Minister said, I am the Prime Minister of Australia, and I will not be deterred from my task of saving the Empire. Neither 1 nor my Ministers shall be summoned or subpoenaed to any Court.

The State is still left burdened with a wide assortment of land bought for closer settlement which it would have been difficult for the most ingenious jobber to have disposed of to the credulous people, even in boom time.

I do not refer to what has taken place in States other than Victoria, because I know nothing about them, but I do know that efforts made at closer settlement in Victoria have been, a rank failure. If the same persons are to be intrusted with the settlement of soldiers on the land under the repatriation scheme the result will be a bigger failure still. The men who took advantage of the closer settlement proposals in the past desired in most cases to become farmers, and knew something of the life, but many of the returned soldiers who are likely to bo placed upon the land will have no fitness whatever for such a life. Unless the Government desire that the money provided for repatriation shall be frittered away they will put out of their minds the proposal to settle returned soldiers on the land.  If I have been destructive in my criticism I ought also to be constructive. Some people tell us that repatriation will cost £30,000,000. If we are to spend that amount on repatriation it will be best to leave land at its present price, and let those who desire to settle upon it do so, and spend the money, or most of it, upon increased industrial production in Australia. We could go in for shipbuilding. We have been promised that that will be done, but the Government have not yet made a start. Freights for the transport of commodities from Australia to the Old Country are now so high that it would pay to build wooden tubs for the purpose, even though they should make only two trips. We should start shipbuilding in Australia now. Wo could not do better for many of our returned soldiers than to find places for them in shipbuilding yards. If there is money to be spent in the establishment of the shipping industry a considerable sum can be well spent in instructing returned soldiers for that industry. We might go in for the production of iron to a much greater extent than we do now. We might spend some repatriation money on the production of steel, plate, bar, and rod .iron, arid plain and galvanized wire. We scarcely manufacture any wire in Australia, and there should be nothing very difficult about its manufacture. We might well undertake some of these industries in connexion with the work of repatriation. Why should there be all this talk about the settlement of our soldiers on the land? Is it because honorable members opposite have friends who own land that might be sold for the purpose, as has been the case under State Governments in the past? Our chief primary product is wool, and it would pay the Government to spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 on the introduction of machinery for the manufacture of yarn and all kinds of woollen piece goods. It seems to me that it is not the desire of the Government to follow such a course as I have suggested. If it is, they have not told us about it, and they are still frittering away the time in making arrangements whilst there are hundreds and thousands of returned soldiers with whom the State War Councils have not attempted to deal. We have many of them going about looking for work. They are willing to work, and have been promised work, but cannot get it. If the Government had been able to carry conscription, they could have done anything they pleased with the returned soldiers as well as with the men in the camps. It takes the men all their time to secure anything like decent treatment even when inducements have to be offered to them to enlist. What would be done for them under the system of conscription, when they could be forced to enlist ? It is my opinion that the Government desire to stand where they are, not because they are afraid of the legislation we might bring into effect as a minority, because they know that we could do nothing that they were not willing that we should do. They want to stay where they are because they have a method of getting men for the Army that they will not disclose to the people of Australia today.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[9]/continue[23]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

These scoundrels can wink at the whole of the legislation of Australia; and so perverse are they that they would rather refine black sugar imported from abroad than sugar produced by white labour in Australia. There are many people in Australia who think that the Tariff is to the benefit of the company; but, as a matter of fact, the latter does not care whether there is a Tariff or not. Some twentyseven years ago, as we know, there was a great strike in Australia, and Mr. Knox admits that he was the father of the scheme referred to in the circular I have read. He conceived the idea that the men should pay so much towards an insurance or pension, the company providing the remainder, just as, I may remind honorable members, the Tramway Company of Melbourne did, so far as the friendly society of their men was concerned. The Sugar Refining Company did not take this step from any kindly feeling towards their employees; they knew that, with pensions coming to them, the men would, perhaps, not strike when there was necessity to do so; but these men would not  scab  on their fellows; they risked their pensions and remained true to the movement to which they belonged. Mr. Knox tells us that none of the men has even expressed regret for the stand they took. Had the men gone down on their knees to the company and asked to be forgiven, they might, perhaps, have been taken back in their old positions. This company, which has made millions out of the people of Australia, is now robbing their employees, either by refunding only the amounts paid into the fund, or by paying men 18s. or 19s. per week instead of 30s. or 35s. This fund was intended especially to hold the men, and prevent industrial trouble. Mr. Knox, in this circular, specially informs the workers of Australia what are the intentions of the capitalistic section. He says that the Arbitration Courts have to go that they have raised wages too high; that the Courts have been looked on as expressly brought into existence for the benefit of the working section of the community. He goes on to say that the task will be difficult because of the enormous legal and personal interests involved, but that every one must see that the system cannot stand when wages must be reduced. It will be observed that he emphatically says that wages must be reduced, because who can hope when the war ends, and tha cost is realized, that the wages r.ow fixed can be maintained? The Government have made no pretence in the way of taxing men who have made fortunes out of the war, and have apparently decided that the working class must pay for this war, as it has paid for all others. But I warn them to consider well their acts. It requires no great stretch of imagination to conceive that the revolutionary spirit of the Bolsheviks may extend to Prussia, from Prussia to Britain, and from Britain to Australia. Do not go too far in making the working section of Australia feel the pinch, as they must do when it is sought to compel them to pay for the war. If that is done we may wake up some morning and find ourselves without our heads.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/para[22]","N/A","N/A"

I propose to pass by the opportunity of discussing the motion before the Chair from a party point of view, and to confine myself to a suggestion that, if possible, we should, both inside and outside this chamber, endeavour to arrive at a common basis of action and revive in Australia that grand spirit of unity with which she entered the war. I do not propose to deal in detail with the various paragraphs of the motion, but first to bring the minds of honorable members back to the conditions under which Britain entered the war. She entered as a volunteer Empire, maintaining a very old tradition, and Australia followed suit, and still remains volunteer. Britain remained in the arena for many weary months as an unprepared nation. I might liken her to an individual pugilist, who, with a good cause and sound heart, enters into a combat with a highlytrained athlete for whom, of course, he is no match. Britain took her blows and staggered in the arena, until she realized that the time had passed for waging modem warfare on an amateur basis. She recognised that throughout the ages all the mighty empires that had had to fight for their existence had thrown the amateur system overboard; and then, against all her traditions and instincts, she adopted the other system. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), after he had been Home, and in the inner councils of the Old Country after he had been in the theatres of war, and, as it were, visualized modern warfare and the means to be employed to wage it returned to Australia and told us what he believed to be necessary. There is not much advantage in post mortems and inquests in the middle of a mighty war, but my only regret is that conscription was not brought about at once. I want to take members back to the stage when voluntarism, and not conscription, was the test before Australia. I admit that we did select a tribunal before which to test conscription. I believe it was the wrong one, but we tried it, and the verdict was against us. We appealed from that verdict, and very fully stated our case again, with the extra inducement, if you will, that the Prime Minister attached to the appeal. The appeal; however, was not upheld. We are, therefore, brought back to what was the position when the parties faced this country in May last. Both parties then went before the people on a policy practically providing for the continuance of Australias participation in the war under the voluntary system. A claim has been put forward by the Opposition that since our conscription referendum proposals failed, the logical conclusion is that the Opposition should take possession of the Treasury bench and operate the voluntary system.

I regret that proposals of a far more mature nature have not gone from the Government benches to the Opposition to take part, as the Labour party are doing in Great Britain, and in other Allied countries, in the waging of this war. A nation divided cannot put forth its best effort. We had last night, from the honorable member for Barrier (Mr.  Considine) a reference to the situation in Russia. If convincing evidence were wanted of the effect of a nation divided from within, for whatever reason it may be, it is to be found in the situation of Russia today. Those who believe that out of a great revolution there will speedily come the emancipation of the masses have, in the interval, at any rate, to recognise in Russia a very sorry spectacle. I certainly hope that the future will have something better in store for her. There was a belief at the start that out of the revolution there would quickly be gathered the elements of a Democracy that a constitutional movement would come along, and that the hope of Russia was Kerensky. But what has been the result ? We have seen factions in Russia directly the revolution took place starting to fight each other. We have seen a grab for positions until finally, as demonstrated last night by the honorable member for Barrier, we see a usurpation of power by the Bolsheviks which the honorable member hoped would quickly spread over Europe.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[10]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

539,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"RODGERS, Arthur","KZT","N/A","LP; NAT from 1917","N/A",3159,"Very well. The first action of the Bolsheviks was to renounce their Allies in the war to repudiate their participation in the war although Russia was one of the first in the field, and the mobilization of that country quickened the actions of others. Their next act was to repudiate the nations obligations, national and otherwise. Then they came to the question of internal confiscation. If that is the hope of modern Democracy I trust it will never spread beyond Russia. My hope is that another and greater force will arise and will honorably carry on Russias part in the war.  I am hopeful that something better will take the place of the present futile attempt in this House to get the maximum effort out of Australia. We are not producing what we should. Honorable members are more concerned about party wrangles and the kudos that will attach to them either as individuals or as a party in this fight. The question as to whether there is a wave of feeling against the Government or in its favour is the one that seems to most to be allimportant just now. So far as I am concerned it matters little whether it be from the party on this side or the party on the Opposition benches that the future conduct of this war shall operate, provided that the men who undertake the work give their solemn pledge to produce the maximum effort on behalf of Australia. If there be any individual or group of individuals standing in the way of the nation, now is the time for selfabnegation. It was mentioned by a Minister of the Crown last night in answer to a statement by the honorable member for Indi (Mr. Leckie) that the members of the present Government were the first eleven in Australian politics. The Government certainly assumed a mighty obligation when they once more undertook the responsibility of waging this war on behalf of Australia. In the circumstances, I believe, the duty is one that the Prime Minister should undertake at the request of the GovernorGeneral. I have been led to speak tonight because the Government propose to ask this week for two months Supply. On the granting of that Supply the House will go into recess for two months. Meantime the forces are massing on the Western Front. Our men are amongst them. Our blood and sinew are stiffening for the test. Our reinforcements, however, are being reduced. In the full view of all these things the Government undertake the stupendous obligation to continue waging Australias share in the war. Every possible interest in the Commonwealth should be consulted, so that everything humanly possible may be done to rouse from the very loins of this nation one last effort to strengthen our battalions. I have listened with great patience to this debate. I was hopeful that there would be shown on both sides a much greater disposition to come together. We are all involved in this question of recruiting. We have all made our appeals. From the public platforms of Australia every honorable member has made his appeal for recruits, and men have responded. They responded to our appeals knowing that we had pledged ourselves to do all that was humanly possible to help in this war. What does it matter that in the interval the Labour party happen to be in Opposition, and we happen to be on the Government side of the House? It is but a passing phase of .political life. lb does not relieve us of the obligation to put forth the very best the country can do for our men at the Front, who have not come from one section of Australian life, but are drawn from every class. Now is the time to compose our differences. We have had our political fights and wrangles since the war began. We have had three elections and two referenda. We have had a surfeit of public wrangling, and press and people, I believe, are sick of it. I suggest that before this debate closes we should know exactly what the Opposition are prepared to accept. An offer has been made to them. It is for them to say whether or not it is sufficient. It has been made by both the Leader (Mr. Hughes) and the Deputy Leader (Mr. Joseph Cook) of the Government. If it be not sufficient, if iti be not in the form most acceptable to the Opposition, then by all means let the Opposition state their terms. If they do, this party will consider them. This party is not entirely run by the men on the Treasury bench. It comprises fiftythree comparatively independent men. If the Opposition state their terms, then I am sure the members of our party will give them the most earnest consideration. I do not: mind saying that I was one of those who, at an earlier stage in the life of this Parliament, exerted every possible ounce of energy to see that a proposal was made to the Opposition to take part in a National Coalition Government. On that occasion the proposal was made wholeheartedly, and every opportunity was given for consultation. The Opposition might well have stated their conditions. The proposal I have to make is that if we cannot arrive at a basis of agreement tonight, we shall at least all take part in the formation throughout, the country of a league of national unity, nonpolitical and nonsectarian. The league should have for its object the registration in Aus tralia of all men and women, irrespective of age. I am not one of those who believe in a measure of war service which merely calls upon those who happen to fall between certain specified divisions of age to bear the whole weight of waging the war. On this occasion the registration should be along these lines (1) Test of membership To stand by the Empire and the Allies until the objects for which they entered the war have been attained, or there shall be a declaration of peace by the Allies; (2) to render services in terms . of my voluntary registration, the object being to unite the Australian people in an indissoluble bond of unity and loyalty to the Empire and to secure the maximum of effort. We would endeavour to secure the registration, first of all, of those prepared to render combatant service, and, secondly, of those able to render noncombatant service. The latter, as the possessors of the greater share of this worlds goods, would be asked to render service and provide a share of their wealth, without interest, while the war lasts. We could see that such men were approached, just as the recruiting sergeant approaches a young man of military age, and asked if they were prepared to register for national service in the way suggested, and, if necessary, it could be known if they refused. At present the burden is not being shared equally, all round. There are many people who, by placing at the disposal of the Government their brains and talents, could be of immense service in a hundred and one different ways. Honorable members on both sides of the House should be given an opportunity to make their individual appeal to Australia through the daily press in such a manner as  they think fit. We should be all committed to the task which lies before us. I was very pleased indeed to hear some wholehearted statements in recognition of this fact from honorable members on the other side of the House, from the Leader of the Opposition downwards, and I say this is the time for action. The war is raging, the enemy are massing on the Western Front, and the Allied Forces are gathering to oppose, them. We in Australia are looking on. We visualize the war by our party fighting and we have had some pretty acrimonious debates of late but I sa,y the. machinery for united war service is at dur hands. It is not for me to set out the details. This is a responsibility for the House, but we now have the opportunity, at any rate, to get .the movement going throughout the length and breadth of Australia.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[10]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member who has just resumed his .seat had something to say about certain remarks made by the honorable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine). I only want to point out with reference to that matter, that during the last few days two cable messages have been received dealing with the Russian situation. One was to the effect that the Russians, by the discord they were spreading throughout the German Empire, were doing more than anything they had been able to do while fighting, to end the war. The second cable was to the effect that Sir George Buchanan, the retiring British Ambassador at Petrograd, in the course qf an interview, had said,  We are looking for the triumph of Korniloff and Kaledine. But these men, I might add, represent the capitalistic interests of Russia. Now the Bolsheviks have clearly and distinctly stated that they are prepared to amass a Russian Army for the defence of the Social Democracy of Russia, but are not prepared to sacrifice flesh and blood for the maintenance of capitalism, and Arthur Ransome, the Russian representative of the London Daily News, said the other day. that it would be wise for the British Government to recognise the Bolsheviks, because they represented the great mass of the Russian people, who were prepared to carry out their obligations to the Allies. The turmoil in Russia has been caused largely by a body of men who appear to be more anxious for the preservation of the capitalistic system than for the preservation of the nation.  The honorable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) has made some suggestions. Later on I propose to refer to them. Some interesting remarks, pleasant to listen to, have been made on this subject; but they are no more interesting than statements which have appeared in the daily newspapers of late. This Parliament, we have been told, indulges in mutual recriminations which should cease, because the country is on the edge of a precipice; the Germans are massing on the West Front, and we must drop everything to save the Empire. That seems all right. Brotherly love and all that sort of thing is a fine sentiment. I dream about it: But when I look at the daily papers published during the last few days I find that not merely one paper, but that the press Liberal and Tory alike of every city of Australia, from Brisbane to Perth, has been indulging in condemnation of the existing Government. It would be almost useless to repeat all that they have said. It would take up too much of honorable members time, and mine too. But I do want to draw the attention of honorable members to a few things. The Sydney Daily Telegraph spoke of the Ministry as  this wriggling Government that seeks to wriggle from its obligations, and the Melbourne Argus the other day said that the Prime Minister was seeking to evade his obligations and that his proposed action was a direct negation of a statement by Mr. Watt that the Government would not carry on if conscription was defeated. The Argus said that no honorable men could conduct themselves as members of this Government were behaving, and the Herald remarked that  honour has vanished from the public life of Australia, and that  politics had been dragged to the lowest depths. The Age said that Ministers had proved themselves unworthy of their trust; that they were cringers after greed, and were the object of public scorn.  The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) they said, was  a disgraced and degraded man. who deals in subterfuges and base trickery, and that  every man who supports him loses his repute and sinks lower and lower in the sight of all decent citizens. The whole of the metropolitan press a few days ago said these things of the Government, and now members of the Labour. party are asked to enter into negotiations with them. What for 1 For the good of our country, or is it in order that we may become participants in all their dishonour and shareholders in their infamy ? Is that the purpose of these overtures ? Can any honorable member bell me what public good will come of this proposal? The honorable member who has just sat down says he is one of a body of men not led by this, Government. Excuse me, what are we here for today ? Are we here to discuss the problems occupying the public mind ? This country, we are told, is on the edge of a precipice, and at the most critical period in its history. But are we here to discuss all these problems ? No. We are here as a matter of courtesy. To do what? To pass Supply for the Government. And when we pass Supply, what will the Government do ? They will go into recess, of course, and close up this deliberative assembly. Are we to participate in the transactions of this Government to sit beneath their banner, and to speak the same things from the same platforms? There are seventyfive members of this Chamber, all supposed to be representatives of the people. But what voice have we in the conduct of the affairs of this country ? As a matter of fact, Australia is not governed by the representatives of the people at all, but by an inner circle of two or three men.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The then Prime Minister (Mr. Fisher) told the House that he would deal with me because I was opposing the Government. I therefore handed my resignation to the Labour organizations, and told them that they could choose between the Government and myself. If they were not satisfied with my conduct they could forward my resignation to the Speaker. They handed the resignation back to me, and told me they were quite satisfied, and I could do as I liked. Under those conditions I resumed my seat in the House. I desire to remind the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) of what took place at that time. The then AttorneyGeneral told the House that the War Precautions Act would not be utilized for any other purpose than to deal with enemy subjects, or those persons who were trading or communicating with the enemy. The Liberal party was sitting in Opposition, and honorable members of it thought that those powers might be used against them to suppress their  newspapers, and to punish Liberals for expressing their opinions on the platform, and they called attention to the width of the powers which this legislation was conferring. The honorable member for Flinders asked questions, and finally, after a definite explanation by the AttorneyGeneral, the honorable member said,  On the solemn promise and assurance given by the AttorneyGeneral that these powers will not be utilized for any other than the purposes specified clearly and distinctly by him I will give my vote for this measure. Those were the only conditions upon which he supported the Bill. Does the honorable member agree with the extent to which, and the method in which, those powers have been used? Were the actions of the Government under the War Precautions Act a compliance with the solemn pledge and promise he extracted from his present leader? The then AttorneyGeneral said that no regulation would be made infringing in any way public liberty unless it was laid on the table of the House, but even since this House adjourned before Christmas we have seen imposed under those powers a referendum which has thrown the country into turmoil, and at the same time we have seen a criminal code built up for the purpose of intimidating the people and persecuting those who were opposed to the proposals of the Government. Have not men been prosecuted, fined, and imprisoned in violation of every solemn oath made on the floor of the House in the presence of honorable members and the press? Because of those pledges honorable members opposite supported the passing of the War Precautions Act, and today they stand behind the man who went to extremes which have incurred for him the odium of all decent citizens in the country, irrespective of their political leanings.  The charges made by the Leader of the Opposition are sufficient in number, and I am not to be sidetracked from them. The Prime Minister has dealt with other matters, with previous referenda, . and other things that did not relate to these charges. I admit that a referendum decision has nothing to do with the stability of the Government. In 1913, the Labour party, then in office, went to the country, and we secured a majority for our candidates, but not for our proposals. We continued to administer the affairs of the country with the limited powers at our disposal. But had Mr. Fisher, or any other man, made a bond upon his honour that unless the power to deal with monopolies was given by the people he would not continue to take a hand in the Government, such a bond would Have been an obligation upon him if any bond is an obligation on a person occupying a position in Parliament. But it would not have been a bond affecting in any way members of the party who had not entered into the compact and know nothing about it. If it had been so regarded it would have been an absurdity, because it would have involved the majority returned by the people to carry on the Government handing their trust over to a minority. The pledge entered into by the present Prime Minister bound only those who made it before the electors, but that fact does not relieve the majority of their duty and responsibility to carry on the government of the country. Had honorable members opposite seen fit to form a new Government, saying that the former Government must honour its pledge and obligations, well and good. Such a course would have conduced more to peace and harmony in this Chamber than any other step that could have been taken. The majority of honorable members have not seen fit to do that; that is their business. The Government have seen fit to violate their oath and repudiate their obligations ; that is their business. The Prime Minister said, It was not a pledge; it was only a threat. I do not care what it was. If it was a pledge it should have been honoured; if it was a threat to intimidate the people it was a cowardly and improper thing. Whatever it was, the majority of the electors refused to be influenced by it. But the Prime Minister will not discuss the pledge. He say3 of the Leader of the Opposition, You did not deal with anything. He desires to sidetrack the issue. He does not desire the honorable member to concentrate public attention upon these charges. He is an old politician. He knows the game. He desires to focus public attention upon other subjects. So he asks us to discuss the effect of the referendum vote upon the world generally, upon our future,, and upon civilization. He says we have not discussed its effect upon Australia, upon die Empire, upon the war, and upon the universe generally. Those things have nothing whatever to do with the questions under discussion. What is the duty of this Parliament in relation to the accusations and charges that have been made? That is the only question that concerns us at this stage. I repeat, if honorable members think fit to support the Prime Minister, well and good; that is their business. But in it we can have no compact or part. The majority of the men behind the Government are quite prepared to support the honorable gentleman, but nobody can accept the excuses he made. Could he not have made a more reasonable excuse? Might he not reasonably have said, for instance, that the code of honour which binds a man in private life does not bind a man in whose hands is reposed the conduct of affairs of State? Might he not have said that the criminal code makes perjury a crime, but public necessity makes it a virtue? Might he not have said,  We did not do these things for ourselves alone, but for our countrys good?  Do we not think of our country all our lives? Is it not in our dreams as it is in those of the PostmasterGeneral (Mr. Webster)? This is the policy we see carried out when Ministers want to find excuses for their actions. In accordance with this policy the PostmasterGeneral said  I brought to the Postal Department my sagacity. I have made order out of chaos. I am the greatest administrator the country has ever seen; but if you do not vote Yes  I will withdraw from you the light of my wisdom, and will not occupy this position for twentyfour hours. But twentyfour hours went by, and he was still in office. And a second twentyfour hours went by, and he was still there. And on the fifth day, at 3 oclock in the morning, his conscience called, saying unto him, Bill, an act of perjury is better than a lost perquisite. Never mind your pledge ; stick to your job. And the Minister said, I cannot tell a lie. Then conscience spoke again, The job is better in your hands than in those of anybody else; hold it for your countrys sake, your services are too valuable. Thereupon the Minister replied :  If you put it that way I will stick to the job. What is true of the PostmasterGeneral is equally true of the Prime Minister. He loves his country; he is anxious for the safety of the Empire, but we have heard some of the things which the newspapers have said about the conduct of the Government. There is no need for us to criticise them. The press speaks of our indulging in abuse and recrimination. Not a word said on this side of the chamber from the beginning of the debate until now is worse than the language used or sentiments expressed in the daily press of this country. Could we get a greater tirade against, or denunciation of, the Government than is to be found in a tabulation of what has been said concerning them in the newspapers?","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He wishes to get me on to something else. I repeat that what applies to the PostmasterGeneral equally applies to the Prime Minister. He puts the Empire first, and we know from the press that he had some very intimate associates. It is a most peculiar thing how many men of honour this party breeds. Their honour, it is true, is never discovered until they have left it. After men have climbed up out of the dirt, after they have been brought from obscurity and given a position in the public life of this country, after they have been able to avail themselves of all the opportunities which the Labour movement has afforded them, there comes a day when that movement cannot give them all that they desire, and they then become servants in the army of capitalism. Capitalism knows their value and knows how to utilize them. It is a remarkable fact that, not merely in Australia, though more in Australia than in any other country in the world because of the predominance of the Labour party here, the reactionary forces are led by onetime men of that party. Under such conditions it is inevitable that those who have lived a lifetime in the shearing sheds of this country, who have worked on the waterside for years, who have always delved and toiled, should regard them as bitter enemies of our class. What must the great mass of workmen feel towards these individuals whom their votes have elevated to prominent positions in our public life, and whom they now see serving against them in every fight for a crust of bread ? Yet that is the position in the case of Mr. Beeby, Mr. Holman, Mr. Hall, and Mr. Hughes. We are told that they left the Labour party in order to serve their country. I dare not apply to them here the most appropriate term which occurs to me, and which will readily occur to the minds of honorable members without my mentioning it. These men are now falling out with each other. Who denounced us? Mr. Holman, Mr. Hall, and Mr. Hughes. Today these men are denouncing each other. Where can there be found more violent language than that in which Mr. Hughes has indulged in regard to his colleague Mr. Holman, or than Mr. Holman and Mr. Hall have applied to Mr. Hughes? There is the justification of our case. These men condemn and denounce each other. They are like rats in a pit. They are fighting to escape from it, and they are tearing each others throats. There is no more ignominious spectacle in the public life of a country than that of men who are battling for a common cause tearing at each other in the presence of their common enemy. There has been no abuse, no recrimination, on the floor of this House which equals what has been said of these men by the press of Australia on the one hand, and their colleagues on the other. Into the controversy that has arisen in respect of Mr. Holman and Mr. Hughes, the Prime Minister has not entered, but his henchman, Senator Pearce, has. These men have been writing about each other, and, on the principle that when rogues fall out honest men come into their own, we now begin to learn something of the real position. It seems that all these men were originally conscriptionists. But when Mr. Holman and Mr. Hall found the votes of the electors were against them, they entered into a written pledge nob a spoken pledge which could be twisted around afterwards, but what the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) has described as a pledge in  clear, definite and unambiguous ^language to oppose conscription if the Federal Government should raise the question again. As men of honour they said they would oppose it. Then they started to denounce each other, and it appears that they entered into a compact to violate their written pledge, copies of which had been distributed throughout the country in thousands. They were to oppose conscription, and for what? To save their political skins at the State elections, because their own positions were deemed to be more important than were the interests of the country. That is what Senator Pearce said about them. Thereupon Mr. Holman turned round and said,  The same thing about you. That is why you dropped the question of conscription in May last. Then Senator Pearce said these conspirators got together and declared,  It is true that we signed a document and put our names to it, and that as. men of honour we must oppose conscription if the question be again raised. But we will perjure ourselves, and do the very thing that we said we would not do. We will support conscription in contravention . of our oath on condition that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth will enter into a compact that ho will risk his political position on the issue. The right honorable gentleman said,  I will. Then, after the referendum, Mr. Beeby said,  I knew him. I knew that he never meant to keep his pledge, and Mr. Holman said, No man could ever trust Mr. Hughes. I am not denouncing the Prime Minister. I am not uttering a word against him. I am merely presenting for the records of my country the testimony of his dearest friends. Mr. Holman said,  No man could ever rely on the word of Mr. Hughes. He never had any empire, save himself. Thereupon, Senator Pearce replied to Mr. Holman,  Same to you. You are a bigger pledge breaker than he is. These are the lovely specimens who have become the leaders of the antiLabour forces in this hour. That is the position with which we arc confronted. Let us leave it at that.  The Prime Minister has now seen fit to change his pledge. Of course he has kept it, but still he remains in the same place. He kept his pledge, went out of office, and still stopped where he wag. Then I am told that he said,  I have kept my Bendigo pledge. I waited upon His Excellency the GovernorGeneral and tendered my resignation unconditionally. Let me say here, that I. never walk into the presence of His Excellency the GovernorGeneral without a spirit of humility, which is proper to me. In mentioning his name, I have nothing to say except in tones of utter reverence. I sympathized with him in the emergency in which he was placed. The Prime Minister went to His Excellency and said,  Your Excellency, I made a pledge to my country, and I am in honour bound to keep it. It took me a long time to think about it. I first thought of it for days, then I handed it to my party for consideration. Its members said that they had every confidence in me, and that I ought to go on. I went on, and I had no thought of resigning. But the next day the newspapers strongly denounced my dishonorable and disgraceful action. Thereupon my party recanted everything that it had said. It held another meeting, at which its members threw all responsibility upon me, and so I present my resignation. His Excellency probably said, Have you any advice to tender me in this great emergency? and the right honorable gentleman replied,  No, Your Excellency, I have not. Possibly His Excellency then asked,  May I put it to you that amongst the sixty or seventy members of your party there are many men who are held in high esteem, who are capable statesmen, and good administrators? But Mr. Hughes merely replied,  Your Excellency, I cannot tender any advice on .such a subject. So he went out of the Presence, and we may fairly assume that in doing so he did not sing, nor did he whistle,  Call me back again. He left His Excellency the. GovernorGeneral to rely possibly upon his own judgment, after being deprived of the wisdom of the most capable man in Australia. His Excellency then looked round for advisers. He looked from Capricornia to the Yarra, from Balaclava to Parramatta, and from Grey to Gippsland. The representatives of all these constituencies tendered him advice. I do not know what advice they gave him, but he looked at the honorable member for Gippsland (Mr. Wise) and could not discover in him any of those elements which are essential to the proper conduct of public affairs, nor could he see in him any of those factors which are necessary to give to the great National party coherence and cohesion coherence especially. Neither could he discover these elements in the honorable member for Grey (Mt. Poynton). Amongst all his advisers he could not find one man to whose hands he could safely intrust the destiny of this country.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Charges and accusations were made against the Prime Minister, whose only answer was,  Think of the honour of the country. Think of the Empire. Do not think of the job. He said,  I will subject myself to a selfdenying ordinance. I will sacrifice everything for my party. I want to see a great unified party, and to keep my job. I will sacrifice everything, even honour, to keep my job. Now he says, Having lost my honour for the sake of the job, I will risk the job if you will take it. Is it a threat, or is it a pledge ? Is it in the same clear, definite, and unambiguous language as that of the first pledge? Will it be kept in the same manner? But what would happen ? Supposing he again goes back to His Excellency and says,  A new crisis has arisen; I love my country so dearly that I am prepared to immolate myself and sacrifice all those perquisites and emoluments attaching to my office for mv countrys good in order to secure a unified party. Will he leave His Excellency in the same position as he did on the last occasion, with no advice? Will he say, There are others you might send for and place in my position 1 No. What can His Excellency do? Can he come to any other result than that he arrived at previously ? Must not he come to the same conclusion, and say once more that the elements essential for the proper conduct of affairs are discoverable only in William Morris Hughes, aid that he alone can give to a great party cohesion and coherence ? And must he not look at all our heads and see no merit in any one of us? Undoubtedly, we shall again have it laid before us that we are all a band of brothers, and the same old Prime Minister will be with us after all our sacrifices. This is what the right honorable gentleman calls selfsacrifice. My word ! Let it go at that.  The second charge is that persecution was applied to public men. I do not see why it should not be applied to public men as much as to others. The great pity is that from the beginning of the war it has been applied to many poor men who do not possess any social influence or political standing. Men with wives and families who have erred, very often through ignorance, have been heavily penalized under laws similar to those which were made to apply to some of my friends here. I was not looking for fines, penalties or risks of any kind. I would sooner run than fight: that is my nature; but in the case of one little paper, the man who printed it was heavily fined, and the men who sold it in the streets for the purpose of earning a few coppers were heavily fined, but the man who wrote it was allowed to go free. When the Prime Minister had that procession in Sydney the riggedup band, the shouting soldiers, the motor cars and the loud hurrahs some poor devil in the crowd sang out,  Down with Hughes! Then it was, You must not sing out,  Down with the Kaiser ! Down with the Czar ! or  Down with Hughes! Ten days. One can stand on the platform and shout  Liar  to every one ; but if one does the right thing and says that the Prime Ministers statements are mythical, he is punished. These persecutions were of the most odious character, because they were so onesided. The Prime Minister alone could initiate prosecutions. He could prosecute any one on this side, but we had no power to prosecute him. The Prime Minister, the honorable member for Henty (Mr. Boyd) and I could commit identical crimes against the War Precautions Regulations, but whereas I would be punished, the honorable member for Henty could go free, and so could the Prime Minister. If these regulations are to receive the indorsement of fairminded citizens, they should be made to apply to all parties and persons, irrespective of religious beliefs or politics. The censorship has been applied in the most odious manner. One saving grace of recent months has been the fact that the daily press have absolutely refused to abide by it to any great extent, and the Government have been afraid to prosecute them. There have been two classes of offenders against the censorship regulations, the newspapers that supported the Government, and those that opposed them; but the only newspapers that have been prosecuted are those that dared to oppose the Government. Will the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) believe me when I tell him that when little weekly papers hostile to the Government republished things that had been published in the daily papers, they were prosecuted and fined for having done so. I do not blame the majority of the members of the Ministry. When I speak of the responsible Ministers in this connexion I refer to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce). They were the two mainly, concerned in the framing of these regulations. Many of these regulations are not known to the country; many of them are not even known to the majority of the supporters of the Government. I am satisfied that many, like the Police Force Regulations, were passed without even members of the Government being cognisant of them. These things are gazetted daily. As I was saying, I do not blame the censors. They are carefully selected for their antiLabour bias, and they are la rarely drawn from among the members of the Stock Exchange, and occupations of that character, also from the Tory press; they are antiLabour to a man. But my experience of them is that every one of them is anxious to do a fair thing, and endeavours to carry out his duties well and fairly, so long as he himself is left to be the judge of the situation. Prosecutions have been initiated in Victoria by the Prime Ministers Department in spite of the recommendations of the censors. I am not speaking of something that I do not know. When the censor was asked to make a recommendation, and he recommended that a prosecution should not take place, he was actually hauled over the coals, and told to mind his own business, and the prosecution was instituted, and he was called into the witnessbox to, support a ca3e which he knew was absolutely rotten, and to endeavour to secure a conviction against a man for an offence which he knew there was not a tittle of evidence to sustain.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Men will take the risk of saying what they feel inclined to say. All that can be done is to punish them.

When BrigadierGeneral Anderson returned from Great Britain, he made a statement, in which he said that there was a Sixth Division. That statement was published in the leading newspapers, whereupon I approached the censor here and pointed out that I had been prevented from making this statement, and had been threatened with prosecution if I did say it. I asked whether I could say it now that the leading newspapers had printed the statement. The censor replied,  I have recommended a prosecution, and it will probably take place against them, but now that they have said it you. can do so. Then, for a time, it was perfectly legal and permissible to say that there was a Sixth Division. But the Government suddenly changed their mind, and gave instructions to the censors not to allow any one to say that there was one, and to prosecute any who did say it. The Leader of the Opposition made the statement in Richmond, and all the daily newspapers published it, but when we sought to publish it we were not allowed to do so, and were threatened with a prosecution. As a matter of fact, we have been punished dozens of times for printing things that had already appeared in the daily papers. The offenders against the War Precautions Regulations are not confined to a particular section, but in no single case has a powerful newspaper been prosecuted. Action has been taken only, against those who were opponents of the Government. The other day the Minister for Defence said that it was absolutely untrue to say that war news had been prevented from being published. As a matter of fact, I had a cable sent to me. Some papers published it and were not prosecuted, while others were prohibited from publishing it and were threatened with penalties if they disobeyed.  Let me come down to the last point that I wish to make on this matter. We have just come out of the turmoil of a referendum, which was conducted under regulations not thought of or considered by members of Parliament.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Of course, when the matter went to the Court, there was no case. The censor was merely dragged into the Court and made a fool of. I do not want to fill Hansard with quotations; I would rather desire honorable members to be conversant with broad principles, but if they want to make inquiries into particular instances, I can satisfy them that all over Australia the thing is a scandal.  Then as to coercion and suppression. Why did the Government inflict on public men and others a kind of spy system, tapping their telephones and opening their correspondence? They talk of Germany, but there never was, even in that country, a bigger or more odious spy system than has been going on here. Do honorable members know what really happens in this country ? There is a crowd of listeners at every telephone, and a gang of men sent to open the correspondence of particular individuals.. The Government cannot be sure that all the men they appoint to do this sort of work are their own faithful agents, and in many cases the men engaged as spies to watch some of us, open our correspondence, and listen at our telephones are our friends. Very often they hear conversations that they are not wanted to hear. Thus we get the Maltese question; thus we get wireless messages; thus we get coded telegrams. The Government build up an odious spy system, and become the victims of it themselves. They employ men to violate their own honour and prostitute themselves. They say,  Go and watch this public man; listen at his telephone; listen to all the . conversations that he takes part in; see if we can trap him; open his letters. Recently I was in communication with a business firm in Western Australia. In their reply letter they said,  Your apples arrived safely. The fellows at this end could not make out what  apples  meant, and somebody went nosing around here to find out what I could mean by it. They have not found out yet. A few weeks ago I was told over the telephone that I could get certain documents if I came down. I went at once. It was not twenty minutes from the time I left my house to the time I reached that office, and when I got there the agents of the Government were there already trying to discover something. Of course, they had only come on a visit of inspection, but they were looking around eagerly. Of course? they had tapped that telephone. They were there before I could reach there myself, but they got nothing.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Government decided that an election or referendum was necessary, would not the ordinary electoral laws be adequate to meet the situation ? Yet, for the taking of the last referendum, the Government changed the very day of the week on which it has become the habit and custom in this country to hold elections. In the voluminous regulations which have been framed and issued under the War Precautions Act, they have had practically a new electoral law created, not by the representatives of the people in Parliament assembled, but by a few men in their dugout, and framed, too, on such lines that the Government thought they would be able to carry what they wanted to carry. They hedged the poll round with a whole brood of regulations, under which all classes of men were to be prosecuted if they dared to say this and that. I pay my meed of respect to the majority of the men sitting on the other side for the generous and fairminded manner in which they carried on the contest, but that cannot be said of the comparatively few who followed the lead of the Prime Minister. They were permitted unlimited licence to say whatever they wished, while anybody who dared to controvert or answer them was haled before the Court under regulations of which not one of us was cognisant, but which were framed merely for the purpose of carrying out the referendum.  We hear how, from a little acorn, the oak tree grows. My God ! out of a rotten egg they manufactured the Federal police force. It sprang, like Minerva, fully armed from the brain of Jove. We are the representatives of the people, but not one of us has had a chance to say whether that force should be created or whether it shall continue to exist or not. It is to go on whether members like it or not. Government of the people by the people and for the people through their representatives ! The people have no voice, and we who are assembled here have no voice. After we adjourn we count for no more than the great mass of the population. In order to carry the referendum not only did the Prime Minister alter the date to suit his convenience, but he changed the very day of polling which has become the habit and even the law of the land, to a day which he thought would prohibit thou sands from going to the poll. Then he took it upon himself, without the members of this House even his own supporters having a chance to say  yes  or  no, to deprive scores of thousands of Australianborn citizens of the right to exercise their franchise. He did it, of course, in order that the voting should be confined to men and women of British descent. A fine sentiment, but if it were carried out extensively throughout the British dominions, whom would it reach? I was thinking how, when he paid_his visit to England and danced through the blue room and the green room at Windsor Castle, his British heart must have swelled with pride as he looked upon the long line of the British Georges George the First, George the Second, and George the Third all trueborn Britishers. When he looked at Battenberg and others of that line, true Britons all, I wonder if he thought that regulation would apply to them ? The honorable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine) reminds me of the position of Lord Milner and others. The Prime Minister did not go far enough. Was it not the honorable member for Perth (Mr. Fowler) who quoted Scripture to the effect that the sins of the fathers are visited on the children to the third and fourth generation? Why did not the Prime Minister apply that principle in regard to the disfranchisement of those of German descent? Why did he not strike off the rolls every one whose father or grandfather or distant relative was a German ; every one who knew <a girl who was acquainted with a man who was once associated with some one who was a German? If it was right to refuse the vote to men who. though born on the soil of this country, by the mere accident of birth, over which they had no control, were of German descent, why did not the right honorable gentleman treat in the same way those who for long years prior to the outbreak of war have both publicly and in private assisted and fostered in Australia German industries and German trade? The other day the Countess of Warwick, in an article published in the London Daily Chronicle, stated that what the British workmen feared was not so much the Germans in France as the Germans in England who saw in the war nothing but an opportunity to rob their countrymen in the hour of her distress. If the action of the Prime Minister was sound, why should the fact be overlooked that there are persons in Australia who have been charged with the administration of affairs of State, who have had so little regard for British prestige that they have caused railway carriage wheels to be imported to support the industry of Krupps. State Governments and municipalities have for years assisted German commerce. Why not reach out to those persons, who are worse than the Germans iu this country? They prate of their British blood and associations, but they have clone more than the Germans to undermine the stability of the British Empire. It is they who have kept German vessels on the sea and on our coasts, and have handed over to the Germans the wharfs of this country and its commerce.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[12]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We dare not mention them; that is not permissible under the censorship regulations. But most of you know that these people are rapidly getting hold of British avenues of trade, and the industries which the Germans used to control. All we are doing is to exchange the commercial control of one foreign country for that of another, and this because we have to pay for support, to offer bribes to win friendship. What we are doing in Australia is to take business from one set of people and give it to another who, .God help us, are a darned sight worse, because the Germans are at least white.  Let me show where I stand. I am an Englishman. I have been in this country since I was twelve years of age. I wish to be thought an Australian. God forbid that we should ever develop in Australia the conditions that exist in the older countries of the world. I have spent a long life in trying to make Australia what England is not. England languishes today because her people have been impoverished by the enemies within her border. I saw England under the most horrible circumstances. I have walked its lanes with my mother, hungry and footsore. I have walked from county to county; from Devon to Yorkshire and Lancashire and Nottingham, and so to London. I have slept under walls, and lived like a dog or a rat, eating grain out of a bag. Yet do you say that I do not love that country? I do love it. All who are near and dear to me are there. The woman who bore me, the brothers who grew up with me, are there. The little village in which I was born is there. I went Home to see it, and the last remnant of my home had disappeared. My ancestors had lived there for centuries, and had fought and died for their country. It was this oldestablished yeomanry who had an interest in the soil for which they fought and bled who made England. They fought for it, and maintained its traditions, and were respected in the land. I left England because she refused me the necessary sustenance and education. She refused to make me a good man and a good citizen. She reared me in hunger; I have known my mother to say that she would sooner see her boys brought home dead on a shutter than have them hanging round suffering. Since the war began, this Empire for which we fight has given over £30,000,000 of money to compensate the Roumanian Oil Company for the closing up of their wells in Roumania, so that the Germans could not use them. In England itself I have a mother seventyfour years of age. My brother there, who had a small business, was taken by the scruff of the neck and sent to France to fight. What is to become of my aged mother and of the invalid wife who cannot conduct her husbands business? Tn England, thousands of businesses and homes have thus been destroyed without compensation. The Prime Minister has said that there are 12,000.000 whose souls are attuned to the slums in which they dwell. That is what capitalism has done for England. It cares nothing for the education or physical development or health of the people. Talk of Democracy ! The great mass of the people of England have never had the vote.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[12]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They have crushed out their souls, they have plunged them into horrible misery, and they are now throwing them into the battle lines. They throw them into the battle line, where millions of them are destroyed. Are those who come back to return as men have done from other wars, to the same horrible indecent conditions?  Do honorable members desire to know what I live for ? I have come out of the bowels of the working class, as others on this side have done. I have been put into a position in the Parliament of this country. I try to be as true as I can to the class to which I belong not because it is a class, but because it constitutes the great mass of the people. By its very numbers it constitutes the Democracy, the Demos, the great mass of the people. We are told that the defence of our country entails sacrifice. One fights for his house, but no one would be expected to fight for it who was merely a boarder. I want to know that I have a proprietary interest in the country. I want to know that others who are called upon to lay down their lives have a proprietary interest in the soil of the country for which they are fighting. Bearing out what the honorable member for Barrier has said, I may refer to what was said by Lord Rosebery, in 1909. I have quoted him before, but the statement will bear repeating. Speaking to the overseas press delegates on their visit to London, he said,  There is at this moment a hush in Europe in which you can almost hear a leaf fall to the ground. Yet in the midst of this apparent peace there is the most active effort for war. I believe the power of this old country of ours to be such as to be able to meet any reasonable combination of Powers that may be brought against it. Such was his confidence in the preparation of the country ; . and it reminds one of the sleep safely in your beds speech of Lord Fisher. This was said five years before the war broke out, and it confirms the statements that have been made that there was great preparation for long years for the war. Gladiators and boxers are trained for a long time before they enter the ring. In like manner the nations are trained, and when the gong sounds they sprang at each others throats. Lord Rosebery said,  When I view the approaching Armageddon I wonder whether we shall emerge from it into barbarism or into a condition of things in which the workmen of the world will rise and say,  we shall have no more of this misery, this grinding of us to powder. So it is today that the hope of the world the hope of peace comes from the rising revolutionary spirit of the peo  pie. The revolutionary movement in Russia is spreading to all the countries, and we have seen from the cables that have recently appeared that the controlling powers in Germany dread more the spread of revolutionary doctrines than they do the bayonets of the enemy. So the cry which the workmen raise is  the best harbinger of peace, since it means the destruction of the capitalistic system, which is the foundation of war, and the destruction of which can alone bring permanent peace to the peoples of the world. It is true that there have been wars in all ages, but the wars of the past were entirely different from the wars due to modern capitalism. In earlier ages of the worlds history men went forth to war, and when they conquered the enemy they lived upon him. They made a slave of him, and made him work for them. But, under modern conditions, men who come back from war, whether fit or wounded, come back to the bondage and slavery, not of a foreign enemy, but of men of their own race, who have made profits out of the war. The other day references were made to the enormous fortunes made in England during the war. The great mass of the people get nothing, but are asked to give up everything. The workmen have given up their trade union privileges. The authorities hope, by a policy of suppression, to be able to secure harmony and peace. We are told that there is harmony and peace in England. Do honorable members believe that ? If they do, let them go to the Library and read the Nineteenth Century and After. Let them read an article in the National Review dealing with the rise of the revolutionary movement. By the way, the National Review publishes an article on the rise of the re volution ary movement which we are not allowed to republish in this free Australia. One can buy a copy of the National Review if he has the money, but we must not reprint an article from it in any radical journal in this country. An article is published in the National Review dealing with the rise of the revolutionary movement in England, which, it is estimated, is supported by some hundreds of thousands. There have been statements recently in the press to the effect that 1 , 000,000 youths in England are beginning to protest against the policy of suppression. The revolutionary movement which started in Russia is spreading throughout the countries of the world, and is not to be ignored even in England. Men talk of the war lasting for another twelve months or two years, but I venture to think that it will not last another two years because the internal situation in the countries chiefly concerned will prove to be more disastrous to the dominant and moneyed powers of the Governments of those countries than any result of a war with bayonets. To come to our own country. What are we going to do in Australia? This country has made a mighty and magnanimous contribution to the war. There are men in this country who are making magnificent fortunes out of the war. I put it to you, sir, that without going outside the walls of this chamber you might lay your finger upon certain individuals I have no intention to mention names and say, Sir, is it not a fact that you are enormously richer today than you were when the war started ?  Is it necessary that I should go any further? Is itnot a fact that the prices of our commodities have become so enhanced, that many persons are much richer than they were when the war started? I say without any disrespect at all that there are individuals to whom we might say,  Sir, you are very wealthy today. You are worth scores of thousands of pounds more than you were at the beginning of the war. What have these men sacrificed? They have sacrificed nothing. The war has enormously increased their wealth. At the same time the war demands that one should lay everything he possesses upon the altar of his country. He should be prepared to sacrifice all his worldly possessions, his lands, or mines, or minerals, and all his resources. There should be sacrifice, not merely of human life, but of human property. Men should be prepared to yield their wealth and sacrifice all their property on the altar of their country for its common defence. I am not here to discuss how and by what methods, but to lay down a sound fundamental principle, and I say that if it is possible to conscript human life it is equally possible to conscript human wealth. What was the spectacle that we witnessed at the last referendum ? On the one side there were the powerful newspapers of the country and behind them all the resources of the men of money, all the powers of wealth, and the prestige of social position. Every advantage was with the Ministerial side. On the other side, apart from the righteousness of their cause, there were few men of any great social importance, or of any great personal ability, and yet that side scored a majority. Was that because of the influence of a few men ? No ; it was because in Australia there is a rising tide of revolt in the young manhood and womanhood of the country, affecting even the men who have returned from the battle; and the position will become worse as time goes on. As to the Prime Minister, no man could have done . more to defeat the referendum than he did. If he had been paid, and asked to carry out methods that would have resulted in its defeat, he could not have done better. All his denunciations and abuse, every method he employed, and all his battlecries, including that of To hell with the Irish, had their effect in defeating the proposal. If he saw anything crimson, it was  the Industrial Workers of the World ; if he saw anything green, he tied something over its mouth; aud if he saw the yellow dog, he tied something to its tail; everything he did bended to arouse the animosities of the people. He raised the question of Germany and the influence of German money ; in short, all he did won him more enemies than friends. There can be no possible finality to this thing.. Unless the Government and the party behind it are prepared to impose conscription upon Australia, as they have threatened to do unless they explain away their threats as they do their pledges they will have to face the situation as it is. They have the reins of government in their hands, and they may utilize all methods of voluntarism ; but they must recognise that Australia has got to its limits so far as the mass of its citizens are concerned. This is not a question of party. It is a question, to a large extent, of Australia against importations. We who were not born in Australia, bub who have come from England, and desire to run this country as if it were an English country, must not forget that an Australian sentiment and nationhood is growing up, and that there is a disposition to cry,  A plague on you and your parties of whatever name or brand. In the particular parts of the continent where the Australian population is in a majority and powerful, the referendum was beaten in the most ignominious manner, and the only places in which it was supported to any extent were those places most affected by the immigrant section. The day and hour has arrived when we who are English have to nationalize ourselves, accept the conditions of Australia, and look at the world through Australian eyes. We who live here have to face, not only the problems of the war, but also the problems that will follow the war. This is the day and the hour when Parliament must ask itself, not so much what it will do during the war, or to what extent it will drain the manhood of the country overseas, but in. what manner it will organize our material resources so as to provide for the men who return from the slaughter line. This has so far not been considered, nor have we yet devised means to meet the enormous debt and load of interest which we shall have to carry in the future. The day and hour has arrived when we should consider these problems. Australia has performed a gigantic task under the voluntary system. No man or newspaper ever contemplated that under a free and voluntary enlistment system our enormous Army could have been raised and sent 16,000 miles overseas. This country, under the voluntary system, has, in proportion .to its population, done immensely more than even Canada, whose people outnumber us by 3,500,000. Somebody has said that this country of ours will not be represented at the Peace Conference, and I agree with the honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) on that point. If, after what Australia has done, the Imperial or any Allied Government dared to exclude us from a voice in any Peace Conference, or in any deliberations as to the ultimate disposal of this continent if any dared to so deny us, after our enormous contribution of material wealth and men and blood, simply because a majority of Australian citizens, in the exercise of their free democratic rights expressed an opinion contrary to that of some one else, then God help us. We should know what was in front of us. If the Minister for Defence has any knowledge of the matter, and if there is any foundation for what he has said in this regard, then it would have been better if Australia had never entered into the war. If it be ventured to exclude us from any peace deliberations. I venture to say that, whether Britain or Germany wins, Australia will be the price that will have to be paid. The future of the country demands that we should recognise the long and faithful services of the men we have sent to the Front, and we should ask ourselves how we are going to reconstruct our country so as to meet the obligations that will come as a result of the vast contributions we have made in the prosecution of the war.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[12]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am somewhat embarrassed in having to follow so brilliant and entertaining a speech as that just delivered by the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey) ; bub I feel that my rather peculiar position in this House demands that I should not cast a silent vote on u is question. If we are to believe what we have been told today, and especially this evening, by a number of talented members of the Opposition, then I, as an anticonscriptionist, made a great mistake in not remaining with those who claim to alone possess the true faith. I do not think there is one member of the Opposition who denies for a moment that) I am, or ever was, .either than a consistent opponent of conscription in any shape or form : but I have been compelled by my regard for that primary principle to sever my association with them. I think I shall be able to show that those honorable, members who have poured the vials of their wrath upon the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and who have credited him with the responsibility for the unfortunate position in which we find ourselves in this House and in the country, divided as we are, have displayed exactly the weaknesses of their own case. While I differ from the Prime Minister in many respects, and have been compelled to oppose even his referendum proposals, I recognise that, from the very beginning of the conscription issue, he has been a>. consistent exponent of the true principles of Democracy inside the Labour movement. I cannot forget the history of the trying times through which we passed in 1916, when the question of conscription first loomed big and large before the public of Australia. Listening to the history of that time, as related by the honorable member for Cook (Mr. Catts) and others, one would be forced to believe that the Prime Minister had conspired against the very movement that he has spent the greater part of his life in building up; one would be compelled to believe that he had become so perverted by association with greatness in other spheres that he no longer regarded the movement or the principles of Democracy with other than contempt.  It is true, unfortunately, that in the hour of danger that threatens Australia to a greater extent than ever before, we in this House are divided and find ourselves inclined to waste our energy in fighting each other. It is impossible, we are told, for us to come together to do what is humanly possible to meet our difficulties, and to face our foes unitedly, as free men should do. All this is because the old feud, which began in the Labour movement in 1916, is still in full blast. That difference is at the very centre of this contentious matter. We must look at the position for a moment to see exactly what has happened. If it be true that the Prime Minister, and those who were associated with him in the old Labour movement, but who have severed their connexion with the Official Labour party, have turned their backs upon the principles of Democracy if it be true that even I, as an anticonscriptionist, have thrown in my lot with the wolves and have left the lambs, there ought to be some evidence of it. What do we find? The Prime Minister went to England charged with responsible duties in the interests of this country. , While there he sought and obtained many essential advantages to Australia and the Australian people. He was welcomed as a man of capacity, as an Empire builder; and the Australian Labour party gloried in Ids triumph. When he toured Britain preaching universal service, preaching and teaching what he considered a vital necessity that the whole of the resources of Great Britain and the Dominions should be thrown into a common centre in order that the war might be prosecuted to a successful issue there was not a note of discord in Australia. No one took exception to his utterances. We know, too. that throughout the British Empire a spirit of patriotism animated the people, and that the principle of conscription was !be ing advocated and taken up day by day by increasing numbers even in Australia. The conscription pot, in fact, was boiling over. I well remember the discussions that took place in Labour circles, both inside and outside the Labour party, at that time. It was evident that the majority of Labour people believed that if the conscription issue were submitted to a referendum it would in all probability be carried. The statement has been made that if the Prime Minister had not brought back this accursed thing with him from Europe is it suggested that he brought it back in his carpet bag? we alone among the nations at war would have been immune from any difference of opinion with regard to this principle of conscription, ls it not as clear as the noonday sun that if the Prime Minister had never again revisited these shores we would have been compelled to face this question ? Is it not clear that when the Prime Minister came back to Australia, a large section of the people were expecting him to declare for conscription ?  And why did he not do so ? When he was delivering those speeches which attracted so much attention, speeches made purposely, no doubt, to educate public opinion to the acceptance by a truly democratic method of the principle of conscription, did we as a Federal Labour party make any demur, or indulge in hostile criticism? No. It was not until 24th August, when the Prime Minister came to the Caucus room, that a discordant note was sounded. It was then found that the Prime Minister had determined, if possible, to induce the party to submit the question to the people. AIr. Lynch Honorable members in the course of this debate have said that the Leader of the Government while in England was carried away by his association with Imperialists, and that he came back to Australia for the specific purpose of enslaving the manhood of this country; that he would, if he could, have thrust conscription down the throats of the people. But is it not a fact that he pleaded and fought wilh his own party to get even a majority of two to declare in favour of submitting this question to the people? If he were compelled to do what we knew he would be obliged to do if the vote failed, that is, resign, a large number of the old leaders of the Labour party, including many able men who had won their spurs in the movement, would have followed him. While, as an anticonscriptionist, I would part with all I possessed rather than see conscription fastened upon the land of my birth, I preferred severance with the party rather than acquiesce in the expulsion of those men who were prepared to stand behind the Prime Minister in a vote of censure if such were moved when he must meet the House. Doubtless members of the party knew what the Prime Minister would do if they failed to put the first principle of their platform into operation by referring the question to the people. The Labour Government would have been disrupted, it is true. A new Government would then have been formed, and we would have had conscription by proclamation, or honorable members would have failed miserably in their professions about doing what they more than hinted it was the duty of the Prime Minister to do to take the only available means at his disposal, as it was absolutely impossible to put the Bill through Parliament, to do what the exigencies of the circumstances and the danger to the Empire demanded. Conscription would have been secured in that way. Therefore, was it not the knowledge of that fact that compelled a large number of the Labour members to sit silent and refuse to vote when, by twentythree to twentyone votes, a motion was carried to submit the question to the people ? The Prime Minister, if he was desirous of destroying the Labour party, could have got all the assistance he wanted, but he pleaded, as never man pleaded before, for the movement in which he had spent his life. And is there one wellinformed Labourite, in or out of this Parliament, who can say that during that trying time the Prime Minister broke tue platform of that party? Is there one? No, not one. This is what the London correspondent of the Sydney Morning Herald, writing after the referendum had been turned down, had to say concerning the opinion held in England bv those people who, according to the Prime Ministers opponents, won him over and made him a traitor to Australia.

The Liberal organs being also Radical, approval of the referendum, but for decencys sake they are unable to say much concerning its result as a contribution to the downfall of the enemy in the field. Nor can they rejoice, much as they would like to, in the defeat of Mr. Hughes, to whose propaganda on this side they were opposed, seeing that it was he who gave the Labour electorate of Australia its chance of gathering up its forces and organizing its attack. The Conservative newspapers, similarly, can say little. They have small sympathy with Labour and less with Socialism. But as it was they who, for their own ends, boomed Mr. Hughes into eminence as the strong man of the Empire, they cannot with any grace condemn the referendum result without disclosing Mr. Hughes as something less strong than they made him out to be. For even this public knows what a strong man ought to have done and would have done in the face of the obvious need for men, and for that reason the Conservative Hughesite press lias been very silent on the subject of the referendum ever since it was announced as the policy df Mr. Hughes. Now, with the result of it a defeat, that press is, on its Hughes side, more than ever in a tight place. So it comes about that nearly all the referendum press comment here says nothing that matters, and is merely the colourless comment of a pious hope that the Australian Army will continue to bc fed by voluntary enlistments which hope, in truth, is all that is available to any of us.

593,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LYNCH, John","KIL","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The Prime Minister might have basely repudiated his party and obtained conscription, but the damning fact that condemns honorable members opposite is that the referendum was submitted according to the constitution of the Labour party. The Bill was supported by honorable members generally on both sides of the House, and the issue was submitted constitutionally to the people. Even if the Liberal members who loyally stood behind the Government had refrained from voting, there was a majority of Labour members in both Houses. It was Labours referendum. It was supported and opposed by Labour men, bub still, if the blame attached to anybody, it attached to us as a Labour party. The Prime Minister had carried out all that was possible for him to do in the circumstances; he had subscribed the Labour partys principles. Therefore, if Labour had been better educated in the tenets of its own faith, it would not have allowed itself to be led astray by all these petty abstractions the things said with regard to what had been done by regulation, and the statements made by . the Prime Minister, whose scorpion tongue, it was said, had always scorched our opponents in the old days while we laughed and made merry over their discomfiture. The outside organizations showed not only that they were out to kill conscription, but that in their panic desire to do so they would outrage every plank of the Labour platform and the principles for which it stood. I, in common with every member of the Labour party in New South Wales, received a warning that if I supported the referendum on conscription inside or outside of Parliament, I would lose my indorsement. I think that furnishes the reason why so many gentlemen who sat in the corner would not vote on the referendum proposal. They knew that if this outrage on our platform this outside domination were persisted in, their political existences would be at stake, and that if they supported the minority they must cause a disruption of the Government and hand the affairs of the country over to men who were sufficiently conscriptionist to give effect to their opinions in the only way open to them, namely, by introducing Conscription by proclamation. It is true that about ten of those men did not support the Referendum Bill in this House, and on the first occasion on which they went up for election four of them lost their seats. We submitted the question to the people, and we denied the right of the organizations outside to dominate our actions. We knew that their action, was based on the resolution passed at the 1916 Conference in New 3178   Motion of [REPRESENTATIVES.] No Confidence.  South Wales, and subsequently adopted by the other States. We knew the action was utterly unconstitutional, and that  the new movement, as it was called in Labour circles, considered the moment opportune for instituting full control over Labour members, Federal and State, that would mark the beginning of a bold progressive policy. The old constitutional and truly democratic method of leaving the punishment of Parliamentary representatives to the constituencies was .to be set aside. It was clear to us that if we subscribed to that principle every member in the Labour party became the mere puppets of the executive, which would be the real Parliament if Labour continued to govern. I appeared on the platform in 1914 as the selected Labour candidate for Werriwa. I said to the electors,  Here is the platform, and I will explain it as well as I am able to do. It binds me. and it binds you if I am accepted, and not even a comma in it can be altered until somebody occupying my position comes before you again. You are not asked to sign a blank cheque. But the unconstitutional decision of the Conference, which threatened with the loss of indorsement every man who dared to support a referendum of the proposal was held to be binding on us, and we were informed on that occasion and the threat has been ruthlessly carried out that we would be expelled from the movement and our seats taken from us if we dared to disobey. I do not think those men realized how far this absurd principle would carry them. They did not see that the indictment of a democratic form of government was involved in their monstrously foolish action. It is true that, by the stirring up of , mud, and the causing of confusion, they tried to induce the people to forget that this outrage on representative government was being perpetrated. For a vain and foolish desire to take charge of the representative institutions of this country by a system of applied tyranny, they forgot the duty that the Labour movement owed to humanity and all the higher ideals for which it stood. How did those honorable members who voted for the referendum in this House escape the wrath to come? They were honorable and straightforward men, and they voted for the appeal to the people. They knew that they were bound to vote in the House as the majority of a dulyconstituted Caucus meeting decided, and they voted accordingly. Some of them had to go on the penitential platform for a while, but they were all forgiven. If honorable members will examine a list of the names of those gentlemen who turned against the Prime Minister when we were asked as Federal members to stand up, not only for the unity of the Federal Labour Government and party, but also for the imperishable principles of right upon which the Labour movement rests, they will find that they represented constituencies in which whoever secures the Labour nomination is sure of being returned. The sacrifice they were asked to make was too great. Perhaps the same accusation might be made against me, because Werriwa is not a Labour seat at the present moment. It may be said that I had not the same temptations as those other gentlemen, but I ask honorable members to recollect that, on 24th August, when the threat was whispered round the caucus room, that men were in danger of having their indorsements refused, I stated that I declined to accept a seat, much less a nomination, from bodies that had forgotten the principle of liberty. I, one of the most confirmed anticonscriptionists, preferred to be driven from the movement that I love,, rather than be led by a halter by those who had no conception of freedom and no idea of where their actions would land the Labour movement!. I have been branded as being lukewarm on this question. In reply, I propose to read what I said at the first meeting addressed by me in opposition to conscription in 1916. On that occasion I was condemned because iti was alleged that the tone which I adopted was too moderate. At that time I felt that, notwithstanding all that had transpired, notwithstanding all the condemnation to which the Prime Minister had been subjected, there was sufficient Democracy in the Labour movement to bring us together again when the bone of contention had been decided, as I hoped it would be decided, by the electors turning down conscription. This is what I said on the 10th October, 1916 From no section or party that continues to withhold and deny a full measure of freedom could I accept a seat in Parliament in the future. Though opposed to conscription of the manhood of Australia, I want to say that I cannot join in the wholesale condemnation of our Prime Minister that a large number of my party is inclined to indulge in. I want to record here my belief that 1 think Mr. Hughes, in advocating conscription for Australia, is animated more by the deathless feeling of love and patriotism for the land of his birth (which all true men feel), more than concern for the immediate welfare of the land of his adoption. i went on to say I do say that the horrors that he witnessed on the field and in the hospitals, the inner facts that were revealed to him, the unexampled opportunities that were his to see and know, what a fate was threatening the loveland of his birth, and her proud Empire has betrayed him into asking a sacrifice from Australia which is foreign to our conceptions of the vital principles of selfgovernment. He must not forget that whilst we all claim to be patriotic and devoted to the Allied cause, there are degrees of patriotism by which useful and effective service can alone be made in this country, and beyond which we cannot go without danger or disaster to our possible maximum effort in this war. It is useless to ignore these degrees I have mentioned, for they have their root in the same noble feeling that I credit the Prime Minister with (perhaps unconsciously) being swayed. We nativeborn Australians must and will put Australia first. I want to show that if the gentlemen who now accuse the Prime Minister of every crime in the calendar were only true to their better selves, they would ask,  Why did not the right honorable gentleman perform this culminating act of treachery when he could have made it effective 7 Why did he leave us nothing to go upon except this small thing by comparison with the big things which he might have done against us, but did not? They know perfectly well that what I am saying is absolutely true. They know that the Labour party submitted to the people in a constitutional way the question of conscription, that it was defeated by the electors, and that, because of the failure of that referendum, there was no shadow of reflection cast on the Prime Minister that was not also cast upon every member of that party and supporter of the Government. Yet we are now told that in resubmitting the referendum, and because of a promise which he made, the Prime Minister stands condemned, as do also his Ministerial colleagues and the whole of the members of the National party. As a matter of fact, I disagreed with the pledge to hold a second referendum, which he gave, and immediately telegraphed my resignation as a candidate of the National party if I were expected to be bound by lt. However, I was informed that I was not, and that is why i am here tonight. As the result of the recent referendum, we are now told that the people are solidly behind the small remnant comprising the Official Labour party that was returned to this Parliament after the electors had ascertained something of the facts connected with the rupture in the Labour movement, and despite the circumstance that the general elections on the 5th May last resulted in the almost complete annihilation of that party. On that occasion what did the electors of Australia do? They practically wiped that party off the slate. The honorable member for Cook Mr. Catts), in his short history of the period to which I refer, said that we repudiated the idea of conscription from the beginning, that we had nothing to do with the wretched thing, but that Mr. Hughes did it all. According to the honorable member, the right honorable gentleman1 alone was responsible for all the evil and all the injury. The honorable member reminds me of the small boy who was picked up unconscious at the heels of a mule, and who, when he regained his senses, was told that he must have done something to the mule. Though he was covered with blood and scars, he absolutely scouted the idea, and said,  I was merely trying to cut my name on his heels with my jackknife. That is why the Official Labour party was turned down. In it we had a body of men who, by submitting to the tyranny which was put upon them by ignorant and panicstricken outsiders, had forfeited every right to the consideration of people loving a representative form of government. These men were defeated, and will be defeated again unless they can convince the people that some new form of iniquity was threatened by the resubmission of the question of conscription to the electors. The Official Labour party has no hope of governing this country until they undo, the wrong which they have done.I am just as sound a Labour man as I ever was. During the recent campaign I told the people in my electorate, many of whom are supposed to be hidebound Conservatives and redhot conscriptionists, that my position had not changed, and that I could not allow an outside body to take away from them the right which T held sacredly in trust for them, or permit their part in the government of the country to be dictated behind closed doors by a few. gentlemen to whom their representatives were to play the part of willing slaves. The Labour movement will never die; the humanitarian principles upon which it has been built up in various forms throughout the world will still go on, but nothing has done more to disgrace a great movement than the surrender which was made by men who, had they taken the stand that others took, and defied their wouldbe masters outside, would have still been participating in a solid Labour Government controlling the affairs of this country.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[13]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

No one was louder in his declamation against the Liberal party than I was; there was no one more opposed to the principles dear to those gentlemen who form the Liberal party than I was, but I recognise that they stood solidly behind both the Fisher Government and the Hughes Government when we were supposed to be a united Labour party. Without in the slightest degree reflecting on the capacity of the Liberal party to take up the reins of government, I believe that, owing to the jealousy of organized labour against capital and capitalism, and against what may be termed the upper grades of society whom the Liberals are considered to represent more largely than any other grade, the best efforts Australia is capable of giving could have been brought to bear at this time only by the methods that were adopted when they agreed to give us loyal support in every action taken for the maintenance of our maximum effort in this war. The sudden disruption of the Labour party brought about a state of things which we now deplore. Honorable members say that there can be no peace until they get on the Treasury bench. They have forgotten that there can be no peace in Australia until the principles of Democracy are brought into play, until the great Labour movement is freed from the pernicious interference of men outside attempting to control fitter and abler men inside. Otherwise, they will make themselves so impotent as to be scarcely counted in the deliberations of the country.  I can prove what I am saying by reference to resolutions in conference and actions right throughout the past. The first referendum was purely a Labour proposal. Surely, then, the National party cannot be condemned for referring the same question to the people again. I believe that there are many who thought that the referendum method should he dispensed with altogether; but, notwithstanding the dictum of the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) that the reference of such a question to the people is opposed to the principle of Democracy the honorable member quoted Abraham Lincoln in support of his contention I believe a true democratic method was followed. All questions affecting the lives and liberties of the people can be settled by reference to the people. Abraham Lincoln was formulating something which had its foundation in a high moral principle. When he said that true government consisted of government of the people by the people and for the people, he was simply voicing something based on the imperishable truth that the right begotten of our common humanity rises superior to all mere petty, manmade institutions ; and as the greater cannot be contained in the less, so the people are naturally the final court of appeal. The second referendum provided at least a necessary corrective to that conscriptionist opinion which the people of Australia are not inclined to cultivate any further, but which, on the contrary, they are the more inclined to dissociate themselves from the more closely they examine it. With all due respect to my conscriptionist friends, their attitude in assuming that conscription is the one patriotic test reminds me of something I read many years ago of a certain clan who were celebrated for having exceptionally wide mouths. The reason was that, as each of them came into the world, he was tested to see whether he was the real McKay by having a huge wooden spoon, an heirloom, thrust into his mouth. The test generally had to be gone through . whatever the infants feelings were. So there seems a tendency to thrust the conscription spoon into the mouth of every man and woman in Australia to test their loyalty. A very great mistake is made by those who take up that attitude. I am speaking plainly in this matter, because I feel perfectly independent on it. It was rendered utterly impossible for me to stay with those gentlemen who made a bone of contention of the conscription racket, because that is one thing just now which creates a panic amongst the people. It has wrecked a great voluntary recruit ing movement, and while that panic is upon the people their desire to avenge the great sin that cries aloud for vengeance in the world is liable, for the time being, to be thrust on one side. I spoke on the question of conscription on the 20th September, 1916, when addressing the House on the Referendum Bill, and my views are the same now. I said that whilst every man and woman was entitled to hold a conscientious opinion for or against conscription without let or hindrance, I could not support it conscientiously, because I believed it was opposed to the doctrine of right. We have heard the parallel of the burglar entering ones house. My interpretation of the law of right, based upon my belief in a Higher Powers is that if a burglar or murderer comes into your house for the purpose of destroying life, or something that is worth even more than life, it is your duty to slay him if you cannot in a more effective way protect your household. It is your duty, also, in a corporate capacity to slay any body of men that invade your country, but the matter must be within the orbit of  your own control. If yon go with lethal weapons in the middle . of the night into the house of another man to destroy burglars who may be prowling there, you place yourself in a wrong position. You might be accused of being there with burglarious, or worse, intent yourself. You place yourself in the same position when, in a corporate capacity, you and your fellow citizens enter another country with arms in your hands. The limitation is there, clear and definite.

It has always been maintained by Labour men that the referendum means the submission to the people of some clear question to which they can give a distinct and specific answer, as a verdict is returned by juries in a Court of law. During an ordinary election multitudinous questions are before the electors, who arrange them in different orders of importance, so that it is impossible to say that the return of any one candidate signifies the expression of the will of his constituents on any one of them in particular. The people having been asked to vote on the momentous question of conscription, why do the members of the Opposition say now that the verdict obtained means not only that there shall not be conscription, but that a majority of the electors has not confidence in the Government, and wishes to be ruled by the small minority opposite My view is that the electors simply answered the question that was put to them without being concerned with the pledge of the Prime Minister. What is the use of a referendum if it is to be contended after the verdict has been delivered that the people have expressed an opinion in regard to this, that, and the other matter outside the question submitted, which had been the subject of statements, or challenges, or promises, or threats or bribes prior to the taking of the vote. We know well that nine out of ten of those who voted at the referendum were concerned wholly with expressing their opinion on conscription, and at the present moment the people are interested not in the question whether the Government has adopted the right method to relieve itself of the obligation imposed by its pledge, but what attitude the Government intends to take regarding conscription : whether it intends to respect the popular decision or contemplates some interference with it. Although most of the members of this party are conscriptionists, the people having been permitted to say directly whether they would have conscription, and having declared against it, we feel that that policy should not be put into force contrary to their declared will. The decision of the constituencies must be respected. And while we maintain that attitude, I shall refuse to admit that the Democracy is better represented by the members of the Opposition than by this party. Honorable members opposite could have prevented the trouble and turmoil that we have had if, after the first referendum, they had realized that the people had spoken, and that so long as their decision was respected the integrity of the party and Government must remain unimpaired. They now ask the Nationalist party to disrupt the Government for the very reasons for which they disrupted the Labour Government, which had faithfully given effect to its partys platform. But it was made apparent then, that whatever might be the feelings of honorable members here, and however much they might desire unity, those controlling the movement outside had sentenced . Mr. Hughes to political death. They ask us now  to disrupt this party as they disrupted our Government and our party, when to have retained them would have been to make it certain that conscription would not be passed in this country during the currency of the war, or even if another referendum was taken. Why did they disrupt our Government and party. It was because it was felt that a refusal to follow the orders which had been received from outside would probably in the future have involved the loss of a number of seats. They ask us now to break up a Government and a party who received the approval of the people on the 5th May, on the condition that they were not to introduce conscription. They ask us to do sp because, in order to placate friends or reconcile foes, the Government came to a decision to stake their existence as a Government on the carrying of the referendum vote, and made a pledge that could not be kept if they were to be loyal to the still greater pledge to the people who had elected them, and had put up the bar so definitely against those who were opposed to them on the 5th May.  Personally, I opposed the Government proposal, as I had said that i would. . I said that I could not support the Government, or appear as one of its recognised candidates, if it went before the country as a conscriptionist Government. But I am not going to vote against them on a motion of this kind, because this is a case of Satan reproving sin. I refuse to kill my elephant to destroy a flea on it, though that might be a policy which would appeal to honorable members opposite. It is most difficult at a time like the present for every man to walk a chalkline, and we should be indulgent and fair to each other. When speaking on the 20th September, 1916, on the Referendum Bill, I said that I intended to support the principle of anticonscription, but, as a farmer with some little property, I advocated that those similarly placed should earmark a proportion of their wealth, nob for the purpose o* immediate liquidation, but in order to make partners in the wealth of the country the men who were brave enough to go forth and fight for us. I advocated a measure which would affect myself in common with every other man in a similar position, and I may say that, whatever little consideration my proposal received, came from those from whom I least expected it. I attempted to give some earnest df my sincerity in this matter. I pointed out that by merely voting at the ballotbox, we could not win the war. I pointed out that it would be much easier for us to vote to send a handful of single men to the Front, to throw a few of our numbers to the wolves, in the hope that we would be able to get away before the danger reached ourselves, than to do what would be involved in the adoption of a true policy of anticonscription, which would demand that each and every one of us should make as nearly as humanly possible an equal sacrifice. I held that we should ask no sacrifice from other people while we were unwilling to give even our all. The business of the country and the relation of classes and industries to each other are based upon certain principles. However much I may disagree with those principles, I know that they cannot be disregarded altogether without bringing woe upon the whole community. I believe in evolutionary progress in all things. If ever there was an opportunity for a people to give an earnest of their sincerity in the cause of patriotism, that opportunity is now with us. We must not waste our energies in fighting each other. We must realize that, as well as maintaining our men at the Front by every possible effort, it is up to us to institute systems by which not only our existing industries will be maintained, but new industries and new production created. We must be prepared to do all that selfsacrificing people should do to maintain their position and independence, and that is all that it is possible for them to do, not merely from a military point of view, but in every other way. To merely vote down conscription will not solve the problem with which we are faced. _ The people of Australia, having been given an opportunity to decide the principle upon which they would conduct the war, have decided against conscription. I think that they have rightly so decided. I do not regard the referendum vote as in any way disgracing the people of Australia. I feel that it would have been an unutterable disgrace to Australia if conscription had been carried. I admit, that other men are equally sincere in holding the opposite view. But we are up against tremendous problems. We have in this great empty country to solve problems hitherto undreamt of. I had an opportunity to tour the greater part of New South Wales as a member of a Royal Commission inquiring how rural industries might be fostered and extended. I have been for 26 or 27 years a working farmer, and I know something of the problems which the people of Australia have to face. After investigating the matter, I saw plainly that our systems of land settlement are unstable, and are not based on equity or justice. Unless we in common with the people of other countries evolve purer and truer systems under which individuals, as well as classes, will be more just and fair to other individuals and other classes, unless we bring about a state of things in which, whilst conserving the responsibility of the individual, we can provide an equal opportunity for all, we shall, as the result of the present world conflict, be drawn into a maelstrom of revolutionary difficulties and disunion which cannot promote advancement, but must result in retrogression for society and civilization. Whilst the war has not actually been waged in. Australia this problem will be as important for us as it is for the people of other countries. Though the majority of the party to which I belong are opposed to me on the question of conscription, I believe that the fact that Australia has retained her freedom in that allimportant matter will cause this country to be regarded as a haven to . which countless thousands of libertyloving people bereft of homes will come. I believe that by the referendum vote it will be found that we have not put a brand of disgrace upon Australia, but have shown the people of the world that this is a country in which we have kept the flag of Liberty flying. It is that flag which has made British colonization the most successful in the worlds history. The fact that Great Britain had to change her system in her hour of danger is no proof that there was a sudden thrust forward by a laggard Democracy. It only meant that the principle of voluntarism had been carried to such an extent that it had been forgotten that eternal vigilance and preparation for war is the price of safety and liberty. At Home and in the Dominions we had failed to make every possible provision for defence; otherwise it would not have been necessary to abandon voluntarism at the heart of the Empire. By maintaining the principle of liberty only can we make Empire expansion worthy or defensible, and that principle would have been maintained in all its glory under the one flag but for the circumstances I have described. I think I have shown clearly that while the party on this side has made an attempt to get the people to accept conscription there is no evidence yet of that tyranny which would compel men, because of their conscientious opinions, to leave the party; but should that moment arrive, I shall be prepared to take the action I took on a former occasion, and tread my lonely path.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[13]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In my humble judgment the pledge or threat though I believe it was intended for a pledge made at Bendigo was an abuse of the referendum. As I understand it, a referendum should be the submission of a question absolutely stripped of all party or other consideration ; but if, as I believe, the Government were driven into making the promise or pledge, they should, as honorable men, be bound by it. A comparison between the referenda in connexion with the amendments of the Constitution, and the referendum taken recently, is not a fair one. As one who fought hard in favour of the constitutional referenda, I can say that, if the party with which I was associated had staked the life of the Labour Government on the result, and had failed to carry their proposals, it would have been their duty to go out of office. However, they never made any pledge of the kind; but displayed more courage than was displayed by the present Government in December last. If the present Government believed that conscription was absolutely essential for the proper conduct of the war, they should have taken their courage in both hands, and, in the election campaign of May, pledged them selves to carry conscription, just as the Labour party pledged themselves to their policy at the 1913 election.  Having twice tested public opinion on the question of conscription, it is about time to conclude that tie people of Australia are distinctly against the system. That being so, it devolves on honorable members on both sides to evolve some other scheme whereby we can supply what we deem to be a sufficiency of men. Honorable members applaud that sentiment; but it is quite likely that, later on, when I express my opinion as to the number of men and divisions that should be maintained at the Front, they may not express such hearty approval. It is said by some that it is not fair to compare the efforts of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, but, personally, I think the comparison a perfectly legitimate one. I say now, as I said during the referendum campaign, that Australia is supporting six divisions at the Front, while Canada is supporting four, and New Zealand one. Whether the war lasts six months or five years, I would not be one, nor have I ever been, to contend that Australia should be called upon to contribute as large a percentage, according to population, as those countries nearer the battle front. Our conveyance of 300,000 men from Australia to the seat of war is a transport feat never equalled in any part of the world; and, when considering what contribution we will make in men, we must always take into account the difficulties surrounding our position. It is not possible for Australia to contribute the same percentage of her manhood as does Great Britain, seeing that we are at least from six to eight weeks distant, in point of time, from the battle front. while the Mother Country is only a few hours. In this respect, New Zealand and Australia are practically on the same footing; and a similar comparison may be made with the United States and other countries participating in the world conflict. It fell to my lot during the recent campaign to address meetings at Corio, Grampians, Bendigo, and Wimmera, and I must say that I had a very happy time. I met with only two rotten eggs, and not one reached my body, though, unfortunately, the chairman of a meeting got one in the mouth, with the result that he will probably carry a scar for the remainder of his life. To the electors I put the position that Australia, with a population of less than 5,000,000, and 12,000 miles from the seat of war, is maintaining six divisions at the Front; Canada, with a population of over 8,000,000, and 3,000 miles from the battle front, is maintaining four divisions at the Front, while New Zealand, 12,000 miles from the battlefront, and with a population of 1,250,000, is maintaining one division.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Up to a certain period 50,000 men were kept in camp in Canada because of the foreign element in the United States, as well as within Canada itself. According to the latest figures, Canada has sent 350,000 men to the Front. From that total, however, we must deduct the 50,000 who are being returned because of their physical unfitness to enter the firing line, so that the position of Australia and Canada, in so far as the total number of effectives at the Front is concerned, is very much the same. I read very carefully the speech delivered by Sir Robert Borden upon his return from a visit to the Old Country, when he said, in January, 1915,  I saw one Canadian division at the Front, and I remember quite distinctly reading this year that he said that he had just returned from the Front, where he saw four Canadian divisions. Right through his speech were references to these four Canadian divisions, and I say now that Canada is experiencing a considerable difficulty in keeping up her enlistments. In view of the position in Canada, I think it is time we came to some decision as to Australias contribution to the war, and having fixed upon the number of divisions, endeavoured to maintain a full supply of reinforcements for them. During the recent campaign I said that, if we could keep four divisions at their full strength, it would be better than endeavouring to maintain a larger number of divisions under the voluntary system. I am of the same opinion today.  I desire now to refer briefly to the Sixth Division and to quote a reply made by the Prime Minister at Bendigo in answer to a question on the night before the 1917 election. Mr. Hughes, as reported. in the Bendigo Independent of 5th May, 1917, admitted that Australia had a Sixth Division at the Front. We had 60,000 men at Salisbury Plain, and a division was formed and sent to France where they aided in the great victory at Lagnicourt. (Cheers.) I have turned up the files of the daily press to find that the battle of Lagnicourt is reported by cable to have been fought on 17th April, of last year, or only a couple of weeks before the Prime Minister made his statement at Bendigo. I am not going to say that the Sixth Division is in .existence today on the Western Front, for I know that it is not, but when people say that there never was a Sixth Division there, I am entitled to quote the Prime Ministers statement which has never been denied, though men who advocated the  No  side of the conscription issue have been prosecuted for saying a Sixth Division had been formed. The fact about the number of divisions was established by the  figures presented to the combined meeting in the Senate club room, and also to a public meeting held in Sydney. Senator Pearce said then that there were five divisions on the Western Front, and the equivalent of another division was being maintained in Egypt, on the Suez Canal, and in Mesopotamia, so that at the time of the referendum we were practically maintaining six divisions. In my humble judgment this number is too great for Australia, situated as we are so far distant from the battle front. It would be far better if we could maintain four divisions at their full strength instead of having a greater number of ragged divisions. Hitherto, there has been altogether too much haphazard promising to provide men for the Front. Prior to the first referendum in October, 1916,  and when a Fifth Division was promised, I raised an objection to the extra division; and I say now that, if we did as well as Canada, which is only 3,000 miles from the battle Front, we would be doing magnificently, because the population of Australia is 3,000,000 less than that of Canada. Even if we subtract the French population of the Dominion, there is still left an Englishspeaking population larger than ours.

As the honorable member knows, I took a line of action in this House which other honorable members did not follow. I was prepared to take certain risks, and told the Labour Executive so. Unfortunately, what has since happened makes it absolutely impossible for us to come together again. Everybody will admit that the splitting of a great party like the Labour party was a very important event. But one of the worst things that has ever happened ho Australia was the introduction of the question of conscription. It was introduced at a time when recruits were freely forthcoming. I do not intend to discuss the anomalies that obtain under the voluntary system. But there are evils connected with the conscript system to which I can never assent.  Let us go back to the genesis of the present trouble. In the early stages of the war, the honorable member for Cook (Mr. J.H. Catts) was the secretary of the recruiting committee in New South Wales, and at that time recruits were coming forward so freely that the commanding officers in one or two of the camps had to request the committee to stay its hand, because they could not provide for the numbers that were offering. That was the time when an attempt was made to introduce the wedge of conscription. The result has been, in some cases, to set husbands against wives, and brothers against sisters. I blame those who are so anxious to fasten conscription upon the Commonwealth, for the disruption which obtains at the present time. There is one point which has been overlooked during this debate, just as it was overlooked during the recent campaign. I refer to the part which our Australian Navy has played in this war. Whilst 1 am prepared to give the fullest credit to our boys in khaki, I cannot forget our boys in blue. Australia has made a splendid naval contribution to the war. She has contributed no less than fifteen fighting ships, manned for the most part by Australians, and she has paid the whole of the cost and maintenance of these vessels, which are playing their part either in the North Sea or elsewhere in the great struggle that is being enacted today. Our naval arm comprises 5,000 men, for whom we have not been given any credit. Even the Minister for the Navy is not prepared to give Australia credit for what she has done in a naval sense. In the matter of munitions, I know that we have not done as much as has Canada ; but I would remind honorable members that in railway units and workers for Great Britain, we have contributed close upon another 5,000 men. From time to time, I have seen letters from men who are doing splendid work in the munition factories of Great Britain. In addition, we have sent away over 300,000 men to take part in the field operations in France and elsewhere. In short, Australias contribution to this war is a magnificent one. Considering our population, it is absolutely impossible for us to supply reinforcements to the extent of 7,000 a month, and the sooner we recognise that fact, the sooner shall we come to our senses. Australia is capable of certain things, but she cannot, and ought not to be asked, to perform impossibilities.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[14]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Coming to our White Australia policy, I say that the working men and women of this country have to depend for their livelihood either upon their brains or their muscle. They have acquired certain rights and privileges of which they are naturally very jealous. Today, in view of those who hold office in this Parliament, they are perfectly justified in suspecting that both our White Australia policy and the labour conditions which they now enjoy are in very grave peril. Why? The answer may be found in the Canadian Hansard. Not long ago a Chinese Immigration Bill was introduced into the Canadian Parliament a measure which provided that Chinese students should be entitled to finish their education in Canada. When that Bill was under consideration, Mr. Macdonald asked Has the Minister received from the coal mine proprietors of British Columbia or any other employers of labour in British. Columbia, any request for permission to bring in Oriental labour? Mr. Roche, Minister for the Interior, replied ; Yes, there have been several requests made on behalf of certain employers of labour in British Columbia, in the central provinces, and I think in the eastern provinces, asking that Chinese labour should be brought in, but the Government has not seen its way cleaT to adopt a policy of that kind under existing circumstances. Then in the Argus of 11th January I read the following cable: The Canadian Government is considering a plan to conscript alien unskilled labour for work on farms, in mines, and in other necessary national industries. This is regarded as necessary, owing to the shortage of labour that is beginning to be felt. Thus we have, first, the question by Mr. Macdonald in the Canadian Parliament, secondly the guarded reply of the Minister for the Interior, and lastly the cable which I have read. The elections are over, and the Borden Government have won, although the other party increased their strength. Some people expected the Opposition party to win, but I did not. For one thing, the rolls were compiled in a very peculiar manner; a manuscript roll was used and other curious practices were indulged in. The newlyelected Government is now making arrangements to bring Chinese labour into Canada.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[14]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The almighty dollar is the sole thought of employers and capitalists in all parts of the world. They know no nationality. No matter whether it is over the prostrate forms of their neighbours, they will have their cheap labour to secure more profits on their invested capital. I draw attention to what is happening in Canada because there is a danger of the same thing happening in Australia. Those who believe in the White Australia policy should pay some heed to an article that appeared in the Pastoralists Review on the 16th February, 1916. It contains a map of Australia with the northern portion coloured black, and the letterpress reads as follows :  We are very glad to see that responsible men, Government officials, and the principal newspapers realize, or are beginning to realize, the impossibility of the White Australia policy A  White Australia  within limits lis very commendable and necessary, for we want no  alien  problems, but limits there must be, and the purpose of this article is to set forth those limits, as marked out in the Review two years ago. ... Within this strip indentured coloured labour from Java, the Archipelago to the North of Australia, China, India, or the South Sea Islands, should be allowed free scope under white supervision. . . . Children born in the country would be subject to the same conditions as their parents, and would have to leave with the latter, or after a fixed number of years. Of course, we realize that the great problem will be to deal satisfactorily with the halfcaste, but owing to limited space this question must be discussed in a future article. It is a problem that can be solved, must be solved, for even if the question of climate did not make a White Australia impossible, the .war has put an end to it. After peace is declared the colour line will become more and more indefinable, and we shall be compelled to recognise the fact, for Great Britain will say to us, Renounce your White Australia  policy, or suffer the consequences. Your blood will be upon your own head. If ever there was an article that should have been censored this was one. I drew, the attention of Senator Pearce to it. I understand that copies were sent to every honorable member. It shows that there are persons in Australia who are desirous of importing alien labour, and knowing the class of people supporting the present Administration, I am very suspicious in regard to the security of our White Australia policy. Some honorable members are very fond of talking about the support given to those who voted on the  No  side during the recent campaign. It is said that the No voters were members of the Industrial Workers of the World, disloyalists, Sinn Feiners, and so forth. The Prime Minister had something to say the other day in which I do not make any charge, but I understand that his language as recorded in Hansard is somewhat mollified he made a very serious reflection upon some of the rich people in Australia. When people charge us with being proGermans, or members of the Industrial Workers of the World, or with being disloyal, I ask what more disloyal person is there in the community today than the food exploiter, who is growing rich at the expense of his country in this time of war? If my friends opposite propose to allow the cost of living to be maintained at such a high rate, many who in ordinary circumstances would enlist will not do so. I have met men who are in the Citizen Forces and who are fairly well conversant with military operations, but they have told me that, though they are willing to enlist as privates, they do not intend to leave Australia and allow their wives and children to maintain themselves on the allowance which the dependants of a , private draw, because they know that they cannot possibly maintain themselves upon it. The principle prerequisites for obtaining a proper supply of men for the Front are an increase in the pay. of the men, an increase in pensions, and a good solid system of repatriation. If the men are satisfied on those points thousands will be prepared to enlist. As things are now, many cannot and will not do so. The course I have suggested is the beat means of obtaining recruits. If there is any man who ought to be well paid it is the man who is performing a soldiers duties. Unless we give these increases we will not get that number of recruits that the most sanguine think will be forthcoming. I agree with honorable members who say that it is absolutely essential to set about looking after the industries of this country. In the matter of repatriation more has been done in the direction of land settlement than in any other direction, but only about 15 per cent, of the soldiers will be anxious to go on the land. I am sorry to say this, because, although I represent a city constituency, I recognise that the aggregation of people in our cities is a great problem. Nearly half of the population of Victoria is in Melbourne, nearly half of the population of New South Wales is in Sydney, and I believe that the same condition obtains in Adelaide, South Australia. i am sure that not more than 15 per cent, of our returned soldiers will desire to go on the soil. What are we to do with the other 85 per cent.? We are making little or no effort to provide for them. The War Council, and other bodies, are making fair attempts to meet the demand, but we have done little or nothing for the organization of industries to prepare for our men when they come back, to create profitable employment, or extend our industries.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[14]/continue[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are getting disgusted with what appear to be the wilful delays in connexion with the shipbuilding policy of Australia. A commencement should have been made with a vigorous policy of shipbuilding over twelve months ago, at least. Sir Auckland Geddes stated the other day in the House of Commons that men were needed; but, about a fortnight previously, Mr. Lloyd George said the great question of the day was tonnage. So it is tonnage for the conveyance of both troops and food , supplies. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) is only humbugging with the question when he talks about conducting arrangements with this or that union. What have the private companies been doing? Morts dock recently sent out one of the biggest dredges constructed in Australia, and I believe it arrived safely in Victoria. We have recently in our docks transformed the sailing ship John Murray from a training ship into a cargo boat.

I am a returned soldier, discharged from the A.I.F. with a good character. I served about five months in Gallipoli. I went to work at Ronaldson and Tippetts after my return, on the understanding that I was to be permanently employed. On 23rd November, during an argument with the foreman, I asked him if he was satisfied with my work. He replied that he was, and that if it continued to be as good I would never be put off. About the same time Mr. Ronaldson told me the same thing.  On the occasion of the first referendum I supported conscription, because I believed that statement of the Government that 16,500 men every month were required, and I did not think it was possible to get that number without conscription. I soon learned that the Governments statement was not true, and therefore on the second referendum I opposed conscription, and spoke against it from the platform. On the afternoon of the night I was to address my first meeting, at Buninyong, Mr. Ronaldson was joking with mo, but the next morning he called me a traitor, and a lot of other names. I was paid up to 20th December, as were the rest of the moulders who were not working through the holidays. I was not told that I would not be needed after Christmas. As it happened, I had a good position offered me during the holidays, but I told the gentleman that Mr. Ronaldson had been good to me when I first went there, and that I would go back to him. I was given a week to consider the offer, but I never changed my mind.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[14]/quote[4]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Learning that all the men started work again on Monday last, I went to him on the following day (Tuesday) to inquire when I could start. He told me I would not get a start at all. I asked Why? He said: I dont want to argue with you. I said: Why should a difference of political opinion make a separation between us? He replied: You spoke amongst the men. 1 asked for a chance to clear myself, but he said: If you dont shut up, I will give you a minute to get out of the place. With that I went. Yours, &c,  M.S. Tolliday. The firm of Ronaldson Bros. and Tippett has a reputation for patriotism, the usual conscriptionist brand, of course. Assuming that exPrivate Tollidays statements are correct and we know of no reason for doubting them the firms patriotism will not stand the strain of providing employment for a soldier unless his views happen to be their views, and Ronaldson Bros. and Tippetts views towards noconscriptionists, and unionists, and labourites generally are notorious. Their attitude seems to be petty and callous in the extreme. If returned soldiers who risked their lives can only find employment by accepting the political opinions of a narrowminded employer, then what did they fight for Freedom? Hardly; if in their own country, that they fought and suffered for they are not to be allowed freedom of thought and freedom of speech. Does any fairminded person believe that exPrivate Tolliday would have been discharged if he had remained a conscriptionist? Mr. Hughes has issued many strange regulations under the War Precautions Act. One that he might issue with advantage is one penalizing smallminded partisan employers who victimize returned soldiers because of their political or industrial beliefs.

In some of the addresses to which we have listened the subjectmatter of the referendum has received more attention than the position which confronts the country today. I should be glad to think that there was some prospect of a Coalition or nonparty Government such as has been suggested by the Prime Minister, but the debate has made it clear that the Opposition is not able to consider any proposal to join a Ministry composed mainly of members of this party. The speech of the honorable member for Barrier and his production of the war policy of the Official Labour party ended all hope of that. Between the proposals for peace, outlined in that document, and the objects for which the Allied Governments and nations are fighting, there is a difference that cannot be reconciled. We are engaged in this war because we appreciate the necessity for achieving the aims indicated in the address of Mr. Lloyd George the other day, and in similar addresses delivered by his predecessor in office. To talk of peace in the terms of the policy of the Official Labour party is to ask the Allies to forego the objects for which they entered into the war. It is useless for us to look for the solution of the present troubles without facing the facts of the situation. It is evident that no one opposite has authority to enter into a coalition with members on this side, and that authority to do so cannot be obtained from those who now control the Official Labour movement. In the speech of the honorable member for Cook (Mr. J. H. Catts) there was a pretence to consider the position as though the Opposition were free to act on the lines he indicated, but I venture to think that the claim of the honorable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine), that he represents the great majority of politically organized Labour in this country, is more correct than that of the honorable member for Cook, or of the Leader of the Opposition, that the party can enter wholeheartedly into the prosecution of the war. If, as a result of an appeal to the country, the Official Labour party were to obtain a majority in this House, it would not then be in a position to prosecute the war in the manner in which Mr. Fisher, when leader of the party, promised that it should be, conducted. For the honorable member for Cook i,o try to deceive the country into the belief that the aims of the present Official Labour party are the same as those enunciated by Mr. Fisher at the beginning of the war is to ask the people to forget all that has happened during the last two or three years. The Labour party is not under the same control today that it was under at the beginning of the war. Since the Avar commenced it has in the States and in the bigger trade union organizations, such as the Australian Workers Union, outlined policies and principles diametrically opposed to those enunciated by Mr. Fisher. Whilst I admit as readily as does any other honorable member that there are in the Official Labour party, both inside and outside of Parliament, men who are wholly loyal, and whose desire would be to assist the nation in the successful prosecution of the war, I say that as the party is now constituted or controlled, those men are utterly helpless in the hands of more numerous sections of it. Much as I should desire to see a Government representative of all parties in Parliament and in the country, and valuable as such a Government would be, I believe that such a° combination is not possible under the conditions which confront us.  Another alternative has been suggested which might be considered, although I have very little hope of any better result being attained in that direction. We have reached a stage when it seems to me that this Government and this party should definitely affirm that the question of compulsion for military service abroad is finally decided for the remainder of this Parliament. That, I think, is a necessary prelude to any scheme to increase the number of reinforcements for the men at the Front. No matter what happens, it seems to me that it would be useless during this Parliament to raise that issue again. While there is a prospect that it may again be raised, whether by an appeal to the country or in any other way, we shall be unable to secure the same united support for any proposals that may be decided upon to secure reinforcements that we might look for if we could dismiss the fear in the minds of many that the question may again be raised during the life of this Parliament. As to the conduct of the referendum campaign, I do not think it necessary to say anything, but I do wish to say a word or two in reply to remarks which fell from the honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs). I heard with amazement and disgust the references which the honorable member felt it necessary to make to the humble beginnings of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. In past days there were men of quite different political views who used to jeer and gibe at those who in the different State Parliaments attempted to represent the workers of the country, and who had themselves followed humble occupations. But that such a gibe should come from one who has been Treasurer in a Labour Government indicated so complete a reversal of the way in which members of the Labour party usually regard such matters as to leave me without any words to adequately express my amazement at the statements of the honorable member for Capricornia. There has been during this debate altogether too much of personal attack upon the Prime Minister. I am not one of those who share the hope expressed by several members that if we changed the leadership of the National party we should avoid the personal attacks that are now made. We had yesterday an exhibition of what might happen in other circumstances. Whilst the Minister for the Navy was making some remarks he was bombarded just as viciously as the Prime Minister had been. I venture to say that in the present temper of political parties in this country whoever leads the National party in this House must expect to be subjected to the same vituperation and abuse as the present Prime Minister has had concentrated upon him. It may be that the right honorable gentlemans energy and enthusiasm in the cause of the Empire at this time have intensified the hostility of his opponents, but it seems to me that these qualities should be regarded as virtues rather than as vices. I believe that there is no man in this country today who is making such sacrifices for the cause in which he believes as is the Prime Minister. In my opinion one of the greatest sacrifices he has made has been to retain office at the present time. It is easy for honorable members to speak of limpets clinging to office. It is very easy to impute to men in the pay of the country that they hold their positions only for their emoluments, but it is a fact known to every member of this House that the Prime Minister, in attempting to discharge the heavy responsibilities of his office at the present time, is risking his life as1 truly as the men at the Front are risking theirs. It would have been an easy way out of the difficulty, due to the pledge which was forced upon him, if not by men at least by circumstances which men created before his Bendigo speech, for the right honorable gentleman to have retired for that rest which he is unlikely to obtain as long as he remains Prime Minister. But the position which confronted the National party was one in which men required to set aside personal considerations and do all that was necessary in order that the work of the country might proceed in the best possible way. The proposal that eleven members of the party on this side should be disqualified from accepting office during the continuance of the war was one of a very serious import indeed for the country. The proposal that at this time, when we need the services of the ablest and best men in the community, we should allow the eleven who have been chosen because of their superior ability to conduct the business of the country to retire from office and undertake the experiment of putting eleven untried men in their places never seemed to me a very practical proposal. It cannot be denied that a Ministry could easily be formed on this side of the House, of men who, if they had similar experience, would be able to conduct the business of the country as well, or nearly as well, as the present Cabinet; but this is no time for attempting such experiments. One of the things that has most impressed me in the proceedings of the last couple of weeks the meetings of the National party, and the various negotiations arising from them is that they form one of the most complete refutations of that school of politicians, or. wouldbe politicians, who believe that politicians are always actuated by selfish considerations and regard only the improvement . of their own conditions. When the National party met, they were asked to say that eleven of the most prominent members of it should be disqualified from holding office. Had that course been adopted, I think it quite reasonable to say that a chance would have been given to twentyfive or thirty members of the party to obtain Ministerial rank. If the sordid motives so often attributed to men in politics were the moving motives of the men of this party, their vote would have been cast in the direction of creating those vacancies. However, the first division resulted in only two members of the party voting against the leadership of the present Prime Minister, and they were both men in my judgment their names have been published who were not actuated by a desire to attain office in that way, but who had always criticised the party leadership. And the subsequent votes afford a striking instance of, not one or two, but numbers of members setting the interests of the country above their own personal preferment and the realization of their .ambition. It is unfortunate that circumstances such as these should have been made the basis of some of the speeches we have listened to during the past few days, in which every evil motive has been attributed to the Prime Minister and his supporters. However, I am not so much concerned with what has happened as with what is to happen within the next few months. Some method of obtaining reinforcements for the Front has to be devised. My personal view is that the whole present fabric of recruiting must be pulled down, and something entirely different erected in its place. I do not think that the public meetings which are held in Melbourne and Sydney and which are exceedingly expensive, while some of the speeches delivered tend to accentuate the feelings raised by recent political controversies: bring to the recruiting sergeants any men who would not come without them. For the future two lines, it seems to me, must be adopted. We must rely more on personal canvass for the recruiting of eligibles than on public appeals which are directed mainly to ineligibles and ineffectives, and which do not reach the men who could enlist.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have heard returned soldiers as eloquent as any men could be, without any results at all, and the money could be much better spent in increasing the number of those who make personal appeals. Further, a great deal could be done by getting officers, who are going to the Front, to recruit their men before their departure. If military men, who are to be in charge of the work at the other end, could be sent out to seek men to go with them, instead of having civilians telling others to go, some good results might be achieved.  While I think it is impossible to form a Coalition Government, it might be possible to erect some machinery for the control of recruiting, by means of which those of the Official Labour party, inside and outside Parliament, who . still wish to go on supporting the men at the Front, would be able to work with others in that direction. The suggestion that there should be a sort of round table conference, of few or many representatives of both sides, might be carried out. Rut before anything effective can be done, it must be emphasized that the attempt to secure authority for compelling men to go to the Front is abandoned definitely by this Parliament. We shall have to give such assurance as will be accepted by the people on that head before we can hope to get much assistance, even from the loyal section of those who, in the last campaign, were associated with the  No  side. I hope that some of the suggestions that have been made in the course of the debate will be considered by the Cabinet. I have no doubt that there is a good deal of truth in the contention of some honorable members opposite that many votes in the campaign were influenced by, I was going to say, the stingy treatment nf returned men, particularly those who have been seriously injured. The responsibility for the legislation under which we are acting in that direction rests with the Labour party, and we who have left the party cannot escape that responsibility any more than can those who remain in it. It seems to me unfair that this treatment should be made the subject of a charge against the National Government, when the responsibility should be shared by those who supported the Government by which the legislation was introduced. The refusal of the officials to allow any assistance to men who are injured otherwise than in the actual prosecution of the war is imposed upon them by the Act itself. They have no power to go beyond it. And so with regard to the miserably inadequate amounts allowed to men by way of pension. The maximum amount is fixed, and the gradation runs down from that level according to the injuries received. These are matters which Parliament should review at the earliest moment, with a view to something in the way of real pensions being provided for those who have been severely wounded, and whose incapacity will continue throughout their lives. There are some other questions with which I should like briefly to deal. With regard to. repatriation, the Government is working with all possible speed. I am not one of those who believe that either the shipbuilding proposals or the repatriation scheme should be pushed ahead with that speed which makes perfect work impossible. Sufficient time should be taken so to prepare the schemes that, when they are launched, they may proceed without interruption. . Too much haste in the inauguration of these matters leads to the kind of legislation of which I am complaining with, regard to pensions. Ministers should take sufficient time to make sure that their schemes are perfectly conceived, and that the preparations aro thorough, before the actual work is commenced. I have not nearly so much faith as Senator Millen has in the measure of assistance that his repatriation scheme is going to receive from honorary services. I think the defect of the scheme, so far as it has yet shown itself, is that it centres too much around honorary workers. In my judgment, it would be far better to have a wellpaid man of great capacity doing the work, rather than a large committee of honorary workers who, patriotic though they are, cannot continue year after year to give to the scheme the necessary oversight, without which it will absolutely fail. I have said all I wish to say with regard to the motion itself. I shall not vote for it. It would have bean much better had it never been introduced. It does not tend in any way to assist in what should be the principal work of the Commonwealth at this time the vigorous prosecution of the war. We have to realize that the objects for which the Empire entered upon the war are not achieved. There is still much to be done before the world will be saved to Democracy. I disagree entirely with those honorable members of the Opposition who contend that this is a commercial war. If it is, then the attitude of those leaders of the Official Labour party who support this war is entirely wrong. During the recent campaign, one of the set questions put all over the country was,  How old are you f  If one said that one was over the military age, the further question was put, Have you any Boer war medals about you V The difference between the Boer war and the present war is almost the difference between light and darkness. Have honorable members opposite, who set these questions, for gotten that the official attitude of the Labour movement towards the Boer war was one of openlydeclared and recorded hostility ? The difference between this war and the Boer war is wide indeed. This war is different from any that has occurred in our lifetime. It was inevitable if those institutions that we value were to be saved to the world. I see in this war an effort to maintain the democratic privileges which the world enjoys. I see in it a conflict that is inevitable if the privileges of Democracy are to be extended, to any country that does not enjoy them today. I see in this war a conflict as between right and wrong between Democracy and tyranny. I  see in it a fight for the freedom of the world, and for the right of the peoples of the world to enjoy that liberty which the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey) referred to last night as being enjoyed here and not in some of the other nations. That we should ask at this time to have guarantees as to the maintenance of the privileges we enjoy in a country that is controlled by the men and women in it, is, it seems to me, quite a fatuous proposal. The men and women df Australia control Australia foday. Whether we shall be able to control it next year, or the year after, depends entirely upon the result of the war now being waged in Europe. All the moving facts that the honorable member for Bourke gave in his eloquent address last night are to me but inspirations to renewed effort to see that the Empire shall not fail in the conflict in which she is engaged. It is true that the Mother Country has too long forgotten the needs of those who do her work, y It is true that she has allowed large sections of her people to fall below the line of decent living. It is true that she has paid dearly in this conflict for the neglect of the social conditions of her people in the years that have preceded it. But we may hope that she has learned in this conflict a lesson that will give to the people of Great Britain an opportunity of obtaining some of the privileges that we in this country so richly enjoy. She is called upon to make tremendous sacrifices in defence of the liberties, of the world, while we here have done, comparatively, so little; but when the war is over her people will gain in a greater measure than we shall from what they have endured. I believe that the war will be followed in Great Britain by a tremendous improvement in the conditions of the masses of the people. I believe that the war will be followed in. every country by an extension of the privileges of the people. I believe we shall win. If we do not, then the reverse will be true. In every country Democracy will suffer and will have to commence again the long fight she has had in order to achieve the position in which she stands today. I believe as thoroughly as I believe in anything, that we in Australia; enjoying the privileges of Democracy to a greater extent than any other part of the world, have for that very reason a greater need to do our utmost to see that the cause of the Allied nations shall prevail, and that freedom and liberty shall not be banished from the world.","N/A","MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[15]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
