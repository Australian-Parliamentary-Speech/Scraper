63,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",791,".- I support the present duties. Honorable members will admit that the fur industry is an important one to Australia. According to figures provided by the Commonwealth Statistician, there are 95 factories and 1,055 persons engaged in the. industry, the land and buildings being valued at £371,146, and plant and machinery at £30,533, while £143,435 is distributed annually in salaries and wages.Prior to the increase of the duties on fur garments, the Australian industry was in a serious position. This was attributable mainly to the heavy importations of fur apparel, due to buyers placing their orders overseas, and the increased duty on dressed coney skins, our raw material, without increased protection being given on made-up garments. The importations of these items had increased from £41,179, in 1925-26 to £87,110 in 1928, which demonstrated the necessity for effective protection. Another adverse factor was that the duty on dressed coney skins was the same as that on made-up garments imported from Great Britain. Consequently, skins were imported in the form of garments, te the detriment of Australian furriers. Furriers in Europe and Great Britain have a distinct advantage over those in Australia, by reason of the fact that the formers raw material is manufactured in their own country, while in Great Britain skins are imported duty free. On the other hand, Australian manufacturers have to import the skins, which, with duty and charges, increases his cost approximately 50 per cent. Wages are 25 per cent, higher in Australia than in Great Britain, and the working week is four hours shorter. Another important factor which militates against the ability of Australian manufacturers to compete with the overseas product, is the manner in which fur garments of English and Continental origin are jobbed at the end of the season, and shipped to Australia at ridiculously low prices. The season begins in Australia when it finishes in England, and overseas competitors prefer to clear their surplus endofseason stock to Australia, which practice does not affect the prices of their new seasons goods. These end-of-season goods are sold in big parcels by overseas manufacturing warehouses, or factories, and Australia becomes a veritable dumping ground for surplus stocks at each change of season. It is imperative, therefore, that the present duties should be retained, to give the industry adequate protection.This is one of the items that the Minister should have referred to the Tariff Board for further investigation and report under the terms of the Ottawa agreement, which provides that British manufacturers shall be given equal opportunity of competing in the Australian market. Since in November, 1929, the present duty was imposed on rabbit skins dressed or prepared, sub-item b2, the Australian coney industry has made remarkable progress. The product is equal in every respect to the imported article, and the output is such that to-day the local industry is in a position to supply Australias requirements for all classes of coney skins, whether processed on Australian rabbit or otherwise. When I was in Hobart a couple of years ago, I took the opportunity of inspecting one of the factories which treat Australian rabbit skins, and there I saw furs of a highly satisfactory nature being prepared.To give some tangible indication that the industry is of real importance, I point out that it definitely employs 250 persons, that approximately £100,000 has been laid out in capital, and that it provides a valuable outlet for Australian rabbit skins.In its report the Tariff Board states that it is satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the industry and the community generally to impose a duty which would effectively protect the manufacturers in all groups of the fur industry. Incidentally, the duties now in operation were imposed in accordance with the boards recommendation. There is the danger that the recommendation made by the Tariff Board on the 27th June, 1930, might be reversed by a recommendation made at the present time, because the board would now have in mind the Ottawa agreement, and the lead that has been given by the Government in the direction of a lowering of duties.I wish to make it clear to the Minister that, in my opinion, any tinkering with these duties must lead to increased unemployment in Australia. It will be noticed that quite a number of the increased duties in this group, which were imposed by the Scullin Government without its having first obtained the recommendation of the Tariff Board, were subsequently endorsed by the board. In the light of that fact, surely those who think that the Tariff Board cannot err will admit that it must have considered that many of the duties imposed by the Scullin administration were fair and reasonable.Sub-items agreed to.Item 114, sub-item (f).Hats, caps and bonnets -Felt hats and felt capelines for women and girls, fur felt hoods for womens and girls hats, berets, womens and girls caps (other than bathing) of any material; hats and bonnets n.e.i., per dozen, British, 45s.; general,60s. ; or ad val., British, 45 per cent. ; general,65 per cent., which ever rate returns the higher duty.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would point out, however, that this industry can produce the whole of Australias requirements in millinery, and that if the already limited market has to be shared with overseas manufacturers, the result must be a considerable augmentation of unemployment in Australia. There are approximately 100 millinery manufacturers in Australia to-day, whose capital investment amounts to £700,000. The normal employment is estimated at 4,000 operatives, and the wages paid to them £400,000 per annum.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That, however, is altogether a different proposition from allowing the importation of hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of millinery. Prior to the increase of duties under the November, 1929, tariff proposals, the millinery manufacturing industry in Australia was in a most unsatisfactory position, due to excessive importations. Big houses such as David Jones, Myers, Farmers, and Buckley and Nunns every year sent their representatives to Paris to purchase large quantities of millinery. That practice was brought forcibly before the honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) while he was Minister for Trade and Customs, as well as before me during my tenure of that office. The landed, duty paid, price of imported millinery during 1928-29 was estimated at no less a sum than £800,000. Overseas manufacturers had a distinct advantage over Australian manufacturers, as in the majority of cases the raw material, particularly in the straw section, was produced in the same factory as the finished hats. Millinery headwear in the past has been particularly subject to  endoftheseason  clearances in England and on the Continent. These clearance lines were sold in big parcels by manufacturers and warehousemen at practically any price in order to get rid of end of the season goods; and, as the seasons abroad are exactly six months ahead of ours, Australia became a dumping ground for them. Our manufacturers have built up a huge enterprise since they were given tariff protection. Employment is provided, not only for girls, but also for quite a number of men. I hope that the Minister will not precipitately take action that will permit of importations even in restricted quantities, and that the duties will not be altered within the next six months as the result of a report of the Tariff Board.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[3]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
68,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WHITE, Thomas","KZR","Balaclava","UAP","Minister for Trade and Customs",793,". - I pointed out when introducing this group, that the whole of the items it contains were confirmed by the Tariff Board. They do nor. need the blessing of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde), nor is it necessary for him to sound a warning regarding what may happen or to remind honorable members of how many employees are engaged in the industry. These industries were firmly established long before the Scullin Government was heard of. That Administration did not attempt to obtain parliamentary approval of its tariff, but merely brought down schedules that in. many respects imposed prohibitive duties and dislocated trade. Now, however, the honorable gentleman takes advantage of the opportunity which this Government is giving to honorable members to debate the tariff, to pronounce a benediction upon this industry. The whole of the group could very well be passed without discussion by honorable members opposite, because it contains some of the few items introduced by the last Government which had the approval of the Tariff Board. In this instance the board reported that the local product is satisfactory, and gives good value; that the industry provides employment for about 5,000 persons, and that She competition is so keen that there is very little likelihood of manufacturers making unduly high profits at the expense of the consumers. Those statements were contained in the report submitted by the board in November last. The matter will be reviewed by the board in the light of article 10 of the Ottawa agreement, .and we can- deal with any further report on the matter when it comes to hand. Seeing that out of 214 items referred to the board, it has stated that in 201 cases the duties conform with the spirit of the Ottawa agreement, why should there be unnecessary fear that this industry, which seems to be well established, and is amply protected, is likely to be prejudiced ?","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
69,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","Swan","N/A","N/A",793,".- It is interesting to notice the controversy between the Opposition and the Government in this matter. A couple of years ago honorable members who now sit on the treasury bench had different views from those they hold to-day. It does not matter, I suppose, if poor people are required to pay an extra 3s. 9d. to 5s. for girls hats. Any honorable member who looked up the report of the investigation made into the operation of the 1929 tariff would see at a glance how unnecessary it was to increase the duties on these goods. What I object to most of all is the double-barrelled system under which duties are imposed. There is not only an ad valorem, but also a fixed rate, and whichever duty returns the higher amount is imposed. Apparently, an effort is being put forward to make the clothing of the poorer section of the people as dear as possible.Amendment agreed to.Item 117 agreed to.Item 120, aa (Feather or down quilts).","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
70,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",793,".- Ministers must admit, I think, that members of the Opposition have shown every consideration to the Government in facilitating the passage of the tariff schedules. Members on this side have no desire to  stone wall  any items ; I merely desire to point out that the duties on feather or down quilts were imposed under the Scullin tariff, under which the industry has progressed. The rates under the 1921-30 tariff were 35 per cent. British preferential, and 50 per cent. general, and the present rates are 45 per cent. and 65 per cent. respectively. Since these rates were imposed, practically the whole of the down quilts sold in Australia have been manufactured locally. The industry is responsible for the permanent employment of over 300 persons, and is of material benefit to the poultry farming industry, which is now able to dispose of large quantities of feathers that would otherwise be difficult to market, and would, as in the past, have to be destroyed. Many thousands of persons, a large number of whom are returned soldiers, have taken up the poultry breeding industry. The feathers are specially treated, and this subsidiary industry is kept fully employed in supplying quilt manufacturers. Quilts in the past were classed as luxuries; but the greatly increased production and reduced selling prices, due to keen competition amongst manufacturers, has brought these goods within the purchasing power of the general public. Cooperation between retailers and manufacturers is of advantage to both, particularly to the former, since heavy commitments for overseas purchases are not now necessary. Thus middlemens charges have been eliminated. The range of local production is extensive, and the public is obtaining satisfactory service at reasonable prices. In the past, a feature that militated considerably against Australian manufacturers was the fact that the end of the English winter coincided with the beginning of the Australian winter, and clearance lines in considerable numbers found their way to the Australian market at prices with which Australian manufacturers could not compete. I hope that the Minister will not interfere with the duties applicable to this item. I am sure he wonders how he can keep faith in regard to the promise made by the right honorable the Attorney-General at the Constitutional Club in Sydney, and the promises made at the last election.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Our chief competitors are found in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the past, German competition was particularly strong, and local manufacture was practically confined to filling in blanks between shipments. However, recognition of the superior quality of the local article, combined with the slight increase of duty, has assisted local manufacture very considerably. This industry gives employment to a considerable number of persons. It is not a large industry, but we have to remember that 100 small enterprises each employing 50 persons together provide employment for 5,000. That is important when we remember that the great problem to-day is to find employment for our boys and girls from sixteen years onwards. Practically 70 per cent. of the raw material used in the manufacture of these articles is of Australian origin, being principally cotton and woollen yarns. The balance, consisting of mercerized cotton yarns and artificial silk yarn, is not procurable in Australia, and has to be imported. With the development of the manufacture of carpet fringes the percentage of woollen yarn used will be considerably increased.The normal Australian consumption of these braids, fringes and edgings is estimated to be worth £75,000 a year, and there is no reason why the local manufacturers should not supply the market entirely, thus utilizing increasing supplies of Australian raw material. I have said on other occasions that when the buyers representing local industries attend the wool sales in Australia and compete against the Japanese, French, German and Italian buyers, the effect is to increase prices and provide higher returns to the Australian wool-growers.If this industry, and others of a similar character, are encouraged to develop, they will demand an increasing quantity of Australian woollen and cotton yarns. Directly and indirectly the industry provides employment for considerably over 100 persons, and it is still developing. The work is light, and offers an avenue of employment for boys and girls. At the present time, there are hundreds of thousands of parents in Australia dependent on the earnings of their sons and daughters. If the young peoples employment were taken away from them, they and their parents would have to go on the dole, which no decent Australian wants to do if he can avoid it. Moreover, factory workers are consumers of the primary products raised in Australia, and the home market is the best market.Item agreed to.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[6]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When I was Minister, the claims of the industry were brought under my notice on several occasions, I think by the honorable member for Balaclava himself. The matter was gone into carefully, and the Scullin Government imposed the duties at present in the schedule. Under that protection the industry has developed. The Tariff Board inquired into the industry, and in . its report dated the 24th April, 1931, stated that it was well worthy of encouragement, and that the rates of duty sought were justified by the circumstances and should be imposed. The raw materials used in the manufacture of gold leaf are gold, silver and copper, all of which are produced in Australia. Before the tariff was amended an increasing quantity of gold leaf was coming into Australia from Germany. The Tariff Board was satisfied, after an exhaustive examination, that the quality of Australian gold leaf was equal to the British, and appreciably superior to the German leaf. I should like to hear from the Minister what progress has been made by this industry since the imposition of the duties. It is situated in his own electorate, and he may be able to tell us something about it. I was anxious that the duty should be imposed, and it was a Federal Labour Government that gave the protection the industry now enjoys. I am told that the industry is highly skilled, and one that provides employment for a number of Australians.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Scullin Government had taken the recommendations of that report as a criterion when framing its duties, Australia would not now be suffering from many of the financial ills with which it is afflicted. The duty on this item , is 10 per cent., not several hundred per cent., as in the case of some of the items dealt with by the Scullin Government. It is not like one industry I have in mind, in connexion with which a 50 per cent, surcharge was imposed, and a prohibition as well.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

89,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",796,".- I thought that the Minister would have brought forward some evidence in rebuttal of my statement. [Quorum formed.] Surely members on this side are entitled to speak for five or ten minutes on each of these items. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs I had to listen frequently throughout the night to monotonous freetrade speeches of from 20 to 30 minutes from members who support the present Government. Honorable members opposite should be a little more tolerant towards members on this side of the chamber who desire to speak to items which were placed in the tariff schedule by the Scullin Government. As the Minister in that Government who was responsible for many of the items, I feelthat it is incumbent on me to say something in support of these duties. When the Minister rose to reply I thought that he had some information to impart; but he merely said that I was quite wrong in my statement that these items were imposed by the Scullin Government, as he wished to tell the committee that they were recommended by the Tariff Board. All I can say is that, in respect of this sub-item, the Tariff Board showed its good judgment. The Scullin Government did not wait for a report from the Tariff Board before imposing duties which would tend to relieve unemployment in this country; it was prepared to take prompt action in the interests of Australia, after an investigation had been made by departmental officers. The Minister attempted to brush aside all the argument of honorable members in opposition by saying that this sub-item bears a duty of only 10 per cent. Britisih; but I remind him that most of the gold-leaf imported into Australia came from Germany and paid a duty of 40 per cent. The Tariff Board reported that, in its opinion, there was no reason why the Australian requirements of gold-leaf should not be produced locally, and that the small additional cost to consumers would be more than compensated for by the employment in Australian factories which the establishment of the industry would provide. I fear that, of late, the Tariff Board has not the protectionist outlook which characterized it a few years ago. We are told that the Tariff Board is an independent body, yet the Ministers predecessor, Sir Henry Gullett, admitted that he had given certain instructions to the Tariff Board, particularly in relation to articles 9 to 14 of the Ottawa agreement, which can only mean a downward tendency in the protective policy of this country.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He told us that these duties had been recommended by the Tariff Board; but we all know that the real test has still to come, because the items in this group are again to be referred to the Tariff Board. The manufacture of gold leaf has only recently been commenced in Australia. Most of the items in this group represent the output of struggling industries, which are carrying on largely with borrowed money. The evidence available indicates that they are doing reasonably well, in that they are balancing their ledgers; but they still owe the money which they borrowed, and will be in debt for probably another decade. I fear the result of the Tariff Boards reconsideration of these items, especially in view of the statements of the Minister that he is concerned only with what the Tariff Board thinks. Unless the Ottawa agreement is a sham, it means that British manufacturers are to gain from it; and, if they gain, it must be at the expense of struggling industries in this country. That is a serious outlook for Australia, because so many of our people depend in one way or another on these small industries. I fear that the Tariff Board, knowing that a majority of this chamber favours a lowering of duties, may assassinate struggling Australian industries in order to benefit British manufacturers.Sub-item agreed to.Item 153, sub-items (b) (d) (Castiron pipes and fittings).","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The previous rates of duty were British 48s., and general 80s. Although importations have been recorded separately only since the increased duties have been operating, it is known that practically the whole importation of these goods comes from Britain. The importation of castiron pipes and fittings was prohibited between the 4th April, 1930, and 1st September, 1932. The proposed duties are recommended in order to counterbalance the lower manufacturing costs in overseas countries, and are not particularly high when all factors are taken into account. Owing to the absence of applications for permission to import these goods, it is considered that the local industry is satisfactorily meeting requirements. There are no importations of cast-iron pipes and fittings from foreign countries.Sub-items agreed to.Item 154, sub-item (e) -Railway and tramway material, viz. : -Fishbolts, per cwt. - British,11s.; general,16s. ; or ad val. - British, 45 per cent.; general 65 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Tariff Board, in its report in 1930, pointed out that the revenue from the importation of bolts was £81,500, and that the sum by which the total amount paid by users of the locally-made bolts exceeded the total amount which would have been paid for similar bolts and nuts imported duty free was £120,000, so that the tariff burden on the taxpayers of this country amounted to £201,500. If we deduct the aggregate wages paid in the bolt and nut industry in Australia, £82,000, we find that under these duties the people of this country carry an additional penalty to the extent of £120,000 yearly. Fishbolts are largely used in the construction of railway and tramway lines. Although the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White) has told us that over 200 of the Tariff Boards reports were re-submitted to that body for an expression of opinion as to whether the duties imposed on items covered by them conformed to the formula of the Ottawa agreement, and he was advised that they did, it seems to mo hardly possible that the board can say definitely that this item is in keeping with the spirit of that agreement. It is true that the rates preserve the margin of British preference; but no one can contend that this prohibitive duty on British imports gives British manufacturers a reasonable chance to compete with Australian manufacturers. Similar bolts cost in England from 13s. to 14s. per cwt., compared with 28s. 6d. per cwt. in Australia. If we allowed for exchange., the English price would be 17s. 6d. per cwt. We should, however, remember that English wages are paid in sterling; this gives the Australian manufacturers a further advantage. In the circumstances, a margin of lis. is unreasonably wide, and as it must affect costs of railway and tramway construction in this country, the fixed duties should be removed. Tinder the ad valorem duties, 45 per cent, on articles of British manufacture, plus 10 per cent, primage, 12 per cent, transport charges and 25 per cent, exchange, the Australian manufacturer has a margin of 92 per cent, against his British competitor. We say that even this margin is too great, and this item, in its present form, does not comply with the spirit of the Ottawa agreement.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The rates are the same as those recom mended for ordinary bolts and nuts, and the ad valorem duties are slightly lower that those recommended by the Tariff Board. The board made an investigation of this industry in 1930, and in one paragraph of its report stated that the applicants claim that fishbolts and railway nuts and bolts should be subject to the same rate of duty was reasonable, as there was no appreciable difference between the costs of production of fishbolts and ordinary bolts and nuts. Accordingly, the board recommended that the application be granted. The industry in Australia is very well organized, and is highly efficient. I therefore contend that there is no necessity for the amendment.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","Swan","N/A","N/A",798,".- I intend to support the amendment. Up to 1929, the duty on this item was 27£ per cent. British and 40 per cent, general. We are now asked to approve of ad valorem duties of 45 per cent. British and 65 per cent, general, as well as a dragnet proposal under which the duty may be lis. per cwt. British, and 16s. per cwt. foreign. We should know definitely where we stand in this matter. Ad valorem rates of 45 per cent. British and 65 per cent, general, represent an increase of nearly 50 per cent, on former rates under which the industry flourished, because up to 1929, the imports were very small. No sound reason has been advanced why we should increase costs of railway or tramway construction in Australia. These duties will add enormously to the burden on the people of this country. I examined the figures the other day, and estimated that the tariff on this class of material has increased the cost of railway construction in Australia by about £4,000 a mile. How is it possible for us to develop this country properly, if, by means of the tariff, we add so greatly to the cost of essential public works such as railways? No one can contend that our manufacturers were unable to carry on under the old rates of duty. These high duties affect very seriously the cost of raw materials in other industries. I ask the Minister to be content with an ad valorem duty. Surely with a tariff protection of 45 per cent., plus the natural protection and exchange, Australian manufacturers should be able to compete with British firms.We never know what rate per cent, a fixed duty may represent; it may be 150 per cent, or even 200 per cent.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The duties on the smaller items of iron and steel production are lower than they were previously, and some are lower than the rates recommended by the Tariff Board, The Broken Hill Proprietary is continually charged by some honorable members with having a monopoly, but the fact must not be overlooked that during the war the so-called  octopus  supplied the rails for the transcontinental railway, and did not increase the price. Some governments give preference to the imported article, even when the price of the local article is the same. Fishbolts are made in every State of the Commonwealth, and therefore there is no monopoly in respect of them. Perhaps from some other country in which wages and labour conditions are at a low level, cheaper fishbolts can be obtained, but I hope that the committee will not, by supporting this amendment, declare that Australia with its enormous ore resources, cannot produce an elementary commodity like fishbolts.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has a monopoly, but in respect of pig iron and other raw materials of secondary production, its record shows a real effort to increase turnover by keeping prices down and to give service commensurate with what the user could get from manufacturers overseas. It is small additional duties of this sort which make it impossible for the manufacturers to reduce their prices. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that this duty is only a little thing, and makes very slight difference to the primary producers. Fishbolts are made not by the iron and steel monopoly, but by allied firms such as that which manufactures galvanized iron. Some manufacturers are definitely shirking their obligations by not writing down their capital and re-organizing their works so as to enable them to manufacture their steel products at a reasonable price. It is these small additional duties which keep up the costs of our key industries and make them a burden upon, instead of an asset to the community. If there is anything that we should make in this country it is iron and steel products. We have the best iron ore and coal deposits in the world, and they are extremely well situated. Practically from 80 per cent, to 90 per cent, of the manufacturing cost of these products is represented in labour. Wages throughout the Commonwealth have been reduced. Although many of our iron and steel products are being sold at a price lower than that of the imported article, the price is still too high. These little additional duties which are imposed as a result of a sort of flabby kindheartedness on the part of the Government of the day, not only increase the load which is already bearing heavily upon our primary and exporting industries, but also interfere with Australian standards. Every time we pay for an industry more than it is worth, industry in general suffers. The Tariff Board recommended this duty some time ago in the hope that additional protection would enable the company to reduce its prices, but the honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Nock) has produced figures which show conclusively that the company has not reduced its prices, despite the lower cost of coal and wages. It has shirked the re-organization of its works which would have enabled it to reduce its prices. It has shown itself to be unworthy of protection, and has become a drag upon the other industries of the Commonwealth. I hope the committee will accept the amendment of the honorable member for Riverina.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[23]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Such is not the case. The Tariff Board inquiry covered the manufacture of bolts, nuts, rivets, metal washers, raildogs or frogs, and fishbolts, and no less than twelve firms gave evidence as manufacturers. Some of. the engineering firms named in the report are well known throughout Australia, and they includeMacphersons, H. V. McKay, and Sewells, three Melbourne firms; one Newcastle firm, and one Sydney firm. As a great number of these products are sold to government departments, competition is keen indeed. The Tariff Board report states that the Australian manufacturers labour under a disadvantage of 115 per cent, in wages, and 63 per cent, in material. Honorable members know little of the efficiency of the Australian factories. The prices charged by them compare favorably with those charged by Midland factories, notwithstanding the fact that our wages are higher and our labour conditions better than those of Great Britain. It is repeatedly suggested that this duty is affecting the man on the land. That statement cannot be substantiated. The total importations in 1928-29, when the duties were lower than they are to-day, were approximately 50 tons; in 1929-30, 35 tons; in 1930-31, nil; and in 1931-32, 10 tons. Much ado has been made about this small item, although it is not pressing unduly upon any section of the community. It is giving work to engineering firms who are badly in need of it. As the matter is now before the. Tariff Board it is sufficient for the committee to pass the duty as it is, and to reconsider it when any change in the duty is proposed.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[24]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

An ad valorem duty is constant in relation to the value of the article, no matter whether the worlds price falls or rises; but that is not so with a fixed duty. The present fixed duty is lis. British, and 16s. foreign. That represents a certain ad valorem duty with a certain definite worlds price. If the worlds price falls - and the price of these commodities in other parts of the world have been falling during the last year or two - then the rate becomes relatively higher than before. The honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Nock) quoted figures to show that the sterling price f.o.-b. of British fishbolts is from i3s. to 14s., so that upon that f.o.b. basis this duty represents something like from 75 per cent, to SO per cent. Not one rail way system in Australia is paying to-day. The railways are unable to meet their interest burden because of the tremendous cost of construction and upkeep of the permanent way, rolling-stock, and so on. The difference between the Australian price of 28s. 6d. per cwt. for fishbolts and of the British price of from 13s. to 14s. sterling f.o.b., surely supplies one explanation of the tremendous overhead and interest burden that has to be met by the Australian railways. The Minister has said that this duty hardly affects our transport system. He quoted figures to show that the quantity of importations was negligible, and that the revenue collected through the customs was almost infinitesimal. We cannot answer this question as to the extent of the burden upon the transport systems by simply taking into account the amount of revenue collected. We have to take into consideration the extent to which local manufacturers are able to tax the transport systems by means of the higher prices which they are enabled to charge under cover of this duty. It is not simply a question of the amount of duty that is collected. We might have the duty so high as to preclude the possibility pf obtaining any revenue whatever, yet the Australian manufacturer might be taking an immense toll of the community under cover of the protective duty. I certainly support the amendment. It is quite reasonable. We should do away with fixed rates, and substitute ad valorem rates, which maintain a constant relation to the value of the goods whether prices rise or fall.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Girls are employed in the iron foundry department of the Sunshine Works. I have accompanied an inspector through those works, and I know theconditions there. The marginbetween the wages paid in Australia and those paid in Great Britain is nothing like so large as it was a few years ago. It has been suggested that these small subsidiary industries are not worth while, but most of the efficiency experts employed by the large engineering works contend that it is the subsidiary industries which enable the major project to be successful. I cannot understand why the members of the Country party should be so much concerned about this duty. They agree that the price charged has not been excessive. They have not tried to contradict the Ministers statement that these articles are being manufactured in several of the States, and that there is keen competition. Their only complaint is that this duty is a little higher than it need be. No harm will be done by having a duty 10 per cent. higher than it might be, because the higher duty will give confidence to the manufacturer to extend his operations, particularly if he knows that the duty is not so fine as to encourage competition from abroad which, if established, would ruin his business. Most honorable members have admitted that the firm which is manufacturing fishbolts - a branch of the major firm at Newcastle which supplies the raw material, and has a hand in many other subsidiary industries - is playing the game. Why should we begrudge this firm the advantage of an additional 10 per cent. duty, the existence of which is likely to give it some incentive to scrap its old machinery, and to install an up-to-date plant, which will operate for the benefit of the community generally. I hope that the committee will leave the duty as it is.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[26]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Since 1914 the railways of Australia have been the biggest machine for making losses in this country. Losses of over £80,000,000 have been incurred in that period. Wages have been increased by 60 per cent., and freights have been increased to a similar extent. The honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) has pointed out that the tariff burden on railway construction amounts to more than £4,000 a mile. In order to help the Minister to see how this item affects the primary producer, I invite him to consider the price that the people of Australia pay for this article compared with the price that the people of other countries pay for it. The excess cost is the extent of the additional burden that our primary producers have to carry. The question at issue is not whether there are or are not any imports, but whether we should be paying 28s. for i t when the people of other countries pay only 14s. for it. This additional cost is being imposed upon us at a time when the purchasing power of the people has been deplorably decreased. The Government seems to be afraid to allow the secondary industries of Australia to meet any competition. In the circumstances, I must support the amendment, and I expect every other honorable member of the committee who has the interests of our primary producers at heart also to support it.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[27]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

121,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","N/A","N/A","N/A",803,"- I am pleased to hear that statement. The rate of production of lawn mowers at the Footscray West factory is increasing. At present mowers are being produced at the rate of 250 a week, but it is the intention of the company to bring the output up to 350 a week during this year. This company could not have established its operations under the protection provided by the 1921-28 tariff. At least five other companies in Australia are engaged in the manufacture of lawn mowers. The material used for the production of lawn mowers here is 88 per cent. in value of Australian origin, and consists of wrought iron, cast iron, malleable iron, bolts and nuts, timber and paint. Only the steel blades and pull bars are imported. The Tariff Board gave careful consideration to this industry, and reported that it was completely satisfied that the lawn mower factories of Australia were in a position to cope with Australian requirements. It also reported that the materials used were of local origin except for the special edges and multiple gears for some types of mowers. These special types are not covered by the item now under consideration, but are covered by the n.e.i. item under the old rate of duty. The board reported that the quality of the Austrailan lawn mowers was superior to that of the imported article. It also stated that the benefit of the additional employment which resulted from the manufacture of lawn mowers in Australia far outweighed any other considerations. In dealing with the selling price of the mowers the board reported that the price at which Australian-made mowers were being sold to the public compared more than favorably with the ruling rates for imported mowers under the old duty. Since that report was made by the board, price reductions have occurred in connexion with various makes of Australian mowers. These reductions have become possible because of increased sales and a consequent reduction of overhead costs. One advantage in having the Qualcast company establish a branch in Australia is that the parent concern makes available to the local branch, without additional cost, knowledge that it has gained from years of research and experience. It is interesting to note that Qualcast lawn mowers are considered to be highly satisfactory in Western Australia. In that State the grasses are naturally tough, and, it is claimed, other Australian-made lawn mowers were unsuitable for them. In its comments on this industry, the Tariff Board stated -The hand mower of the type which preponderates in the Australian trade is a suitable line for local manufacture for the reason that it is largely repetition work of a mechanical nature. The amount of direct labour required to turn out the full Australian requirement in hand lawn mowers is not large. . . The board considers additional protection is necessary to secure the business to the Australian manufacturers, and, therefore, recommends that the ad valorem rates of duty of 45 per cent. (British preferential tariff), 55 per cent, (intermediate tariff), mid CO per cent, (general tariff) should be applied to the class of hand lawn mower manufactured in Australia.This is another of the new industries that were established as a result of the tariff proposals of the Scullin Government, and for the future of which I am apprehensive, in view of the changed fiscal policy of certain honorable members, who are prepared to make a scapegoat of the Tariff Board in connexion with any alterations that may be effected in the tariff. I am afraid that, however desirous the- Minister might be of continuing a protectionist policy for these new and rapidly-developing industries, he will not be a free man when the board recommends reductions. I have inspected the industry, and realize its possibilities as a direct and indirect employer of labour. It draws on the great iron and steel works of Newcastle for its raw materials, a procedure which must, in the aggregate, bring about a reduction of those raw materials to all industries.Sub-items agreed to.Item 169, sub-item (d) agreed to.Item 176, sub-item (i 1, 2) (Pumps of the type used for vending petrol).","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[29]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The duty on petrol pumps is, frankly, prohibitive, and that is admitted even by the Tariff BoardThat body stated in its report upon the1., matter that, before the increased duty was granted, Australian manufacturers of petrol pumps were already producing and supplying 95 per cent, of our local requirements. Obviously, the intention was to close up that small leak, the remaining 5 per cent. Several honorable gentlemen who now occupy the treasury bench spoke strongly against the proposal of the Scullin Government to increase these duties. Among them were the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White), the Deputy Leader of the Government (Mr. Latham), the honorable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), and the Postmaster-General (Mr. Parkhill). In his protest, the honorable member for Henty said - 1 associate myself with the remarks of the right honorable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page). Despite the recommendations of the Tariff Board, I object to the creation of this monopoly. It has already been pointed out that the local manufacturers have gained 95 per cent, of the Australian trade. The previous duty was quite adequate, and the 5 per cent, of imports has had the valuable effect of regulating both price and quality of the products. Take that away and we shall, in effect, bring about the suppression of existing competition. The local manufacturers will get together, if not in actual combine, at least in coming to an arrangement, and prices, as a result, will increase, and the quality of the article most likely suffer.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At that time, the oil companies were importing a considerable number of petrol pumps from the United States of America. The then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) indicated that ample proof had been afforded him and the Government that petrol pumps could be manufactured in Australia superior to the imported article, and that therefore the industry was deserving of protection. The unfortunate garage proprietors were then paying exorbitant prices for pumps imported from the United States of America. Unfortunately, certain honorable members attach the term monopoly only to industries which are established within the- bounds of the Commonwealth. On that occasion, the organization controlling supplies from the United States of America was a much more menacing monopoly than any that now exists in Australia. This duty was needed, and it has proved in every way satisfactory. If honorable members will examine the pumps which are manufactured locally, they will appreciate the wonderful adaptability and ingenuity of Australian manufacturers and workmen. The industry was entirely new to this country, but, within a few years, our manufacturers are turning out an article about which it may be truth- fully said that no better is obtainable.

As a result of the petrol pumps being manufactured in Australia, the price has fallen from about £80 to half that amount, showing that the public is not being exploited.

The reasonable attitude of the Opposition in this regard is in direct contrast to that of honorable members opposite when they were in Opposition and the Scullin tariff was being considered. The duties on telephone and telegraphic apparatus are considerably below those which were sought by the manufacturers who appeared before the Tariff Board in September and October, 1930. To effectively protect the industry, specific rates of duty are necessary. I urge the Minister to give the matter further consideration. The present tariff was imposed on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, but was not considered by the previous Government to be really protective. At the inquiry that was conducted by the Tariff Board, it was shown that there would be keen competition in Australia in the production of any lines that could be manufactured in this country. In this connexion, it should be noted that the present duties apply only to those lines that can be economically produced in Australia. Owing to the financial depression, the Postmaster-Generals Department has not, for some time, been ordering telephone apparatus to any great extent. But immediately the depression lifts sufficiently to allow it again to order in satisfactory quantities, a considerable number of radio manufacturers who are very well equipped to-day for the production of telephone and telegraph apparatus will be willing to engage in the manufacture of those lines. There is no doubt that the Governmentwould be able to purchase at favorable prices, because of the substantial increase that has taken place in the production of Australian wireless receiving sets - a production that is three or four times as great as it was four years ago. Oyer £500,000 is invested in the radio, telephone, and telegraph apparatus manufacturing industry in Australia, and thousands of pounds have been expended upon dies, &c., for the manufacture of telephone apparatus. If fully developed, this industry would be of great economic value to Australia, and would provide congenial employment for many of our young people. For a number of years there has been very little variation in the design of telephone apparatus; consequently, from the standpoint of evolution, the items under review are stable. The potentialities of Australia for the manufacture of telephone and telegraph apparatus are altogether different to-day from what they were when the Tariff Board last considered this matter. I believe that, if the board made a further inquiry, it would submit a different report. The radio manufacturing industry is firmly established in this country.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[34]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In 1921, when radio broadcasting began to develop, practically all the big telephone manufacturers in the world turned their attention to the manufacture of radio apparatus. The radio manufacturers of the Commonwealth are now in a position to turn their attention to the production of telephones and telephone apparatus. A number of them have oversea connexions of worldwide repute to assist them. That is an important factor in the establishment and development of Australian industries, because overseas connexions can keep the local interests supplied with the results of the latest research work, that are obtained at a cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum. One of the difficulties under which the Australian manufacturer of radio apparatus labours, is that the demand for his radio goods is seasonal, rising to its peak in the winter, and waning considerably during the summer months, when he invariably reduces his staff substantially. It is with a view to filling in that slack period that I should like to see these manufacturers producing telephone and telegraph apparatus in their workshops. If the duties that are now sought on that apparatus were made truly effective, the radio manufacturing industry of the Commonwealth would be in a position to produce telephone apparatus during the summer months, thus increasing its turnover, reducing its costs of production, and leading to the permanent employment of thousands of Australian workers who are now engaged in seasonal industries. I admit that the duties in the schedule are based upon a recommendation of the Tariff Board. The inquiry which resulted in that recommendation, however, was made some years ago, and I submit that the factories have since become more- fully equipped, with the result that the manufacturers could tell a different story to the board, and probably induce it to revise its previous decision. Not only would additional work be provided in the radio factories of the Commonwealth, but benefit would be conferred on other Australian manufacturers who produce the raw materials of the radio and telephone manufacturers, such as electrical porcelains, papier mache articles, presses and machine tools, galvanized iron products, aluminium castings, paint and varnish, bakelite powder, hard rubber and ebonite, machine screws, insulating compounds, wooden cabinets, and much other material. I submit that, if effectively protected, the industry as a whole would provide employment for about 4,000 operatives when the Postmaster-Generals Department resumed normal buying. We are told that to-day the revenues are buoyant, that telephone, postal, and wireless returns are most promising, and that, in the near future, there will probably be a return to normal development in the telephone and telegraph branches. Any appreciable addition to the number of telephones requiring to be installed throughout Australia would result in a big increase in the imports of this apparatus should it not be made in Australia. There is nothing very difficult connected with its construction. Certain lines are covered by patents; but it is known that electrical manufacturing companies, or branches of overseas manufacturers, hold the Australian rights for the manufacture in this country of a number of lines that were formerly imported. This is another avenue of employment that might well be explored.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[35]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under the previous tariff the output reached a maximum of 4,000,000 lamps a year, but last year, owing to a sudden influx into Australia of cheap lamps from Japan, it dropped to 1,000,000. The Minister might well instruct his officers to investigate the likelihood of the dumping of these lamps, and if that is evident, steps should be taken to protect the industry in Australia.Mr. WHITE (Balaclava- Minister for on filament lamps was considered adequate, but a depreciated currency enabled some countries to market their product in Australia at allegedly low prices. That fact came officially to the notice of the department only yesterday. I am having inquiries made, and if the industry can establish a prima facie case, the matter will be referred to the Tariff Board with a view to applying the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[37]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
147,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",808,".- I was somewhat surprised to hear the Minister say that the duty on filament lamps was adequate. I understand that it was quite inadequate, and that for that reason the Phillips Lamps Company Limited, of Newcastle, made very strong representations to the Prime Minister during his recent visit to that city. The right honorable gentleman then replied that he was greatly impressed with what he had seen at the companys factory, and was amazed to learn that these lamps were being manufactured in Australia. He said that he was not aware that they could be produced in this country. That statement led the manufacturers to hope that they would be given adequate protection. The honorable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) has been deeply interested in this industry for a long period, and when I was Minister for Trade and Customs he induced . me to visit the works at Newcastle. The factory is one of the most up to date in the world. It is a branch of an efficient overseas firm, and is kept abreast of the times by being supplied with the results of the latest electrical research work. The local company complains that at the present time it cannot compete with the cheap electrical goods that are being imported from Eastern countries. This matter was seriously considered by the Scullin Government, and I have no doubt that the present Ministry has given attention to it. I should like to have a definite assurance from the Minister that these duties will be reconsidered.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[38]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
148,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WHITE, Thomas","KZR","Balaclava","UAP","Minister for Trade and Customs",808,".- When I stated that the duties were adequate, I may not have made myself clearly understood. There is a paragraph in the report of the Tariff Board stating that the board was satisfied that the proposed duties would not entirely eliminate competition, nor was this desirable, because there was a fair demand for lamps of the cheaper types, and if these were excluded a certain proportion of the public would have to buy lamps of a higher quality than they required. Most of the complaints heard now are due to circumstances that have arisen lately, and if a good case can be made out by the local manufacturers, steps will be taken to safeguard their interests. I move -That that portion of the tariff resolution introduced into the House of Representatives on 8th March, 1933, relating to the heading to sub-item (e) and paragraphs (1), (2), (4), (7) to (16) inclusive, (18) to (21) inelusive and (24) of sub-item (b) of item 180 be incorporated in the present proposals as on and from the 9th March, 1933, in lieu of the heading to sub-item (e) and paragraphs (1), (2), (4), (7) to (16) inclusive, (18) to 21 inclusive and (24) of sub-item (e) of item 180 of the tariff resolution introduced into the House of Representatives on the 13th October, 1932.No alteration of duties is involved by this motion, and it makes no alteration of the rates or wording appearing in the group memorandum in the possession of honorable members.Amendment agreed to.Sub-items and paragraphs, as amended, agreed to.Item 181, sub-item (b 1), agreed to.Item 182 (Bolts, nuts, rivets, and metal washers, n.e.i.) - 182.

149,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",808,".- These duties were imposed by the Scullin Government on the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Considerable capital investment, amounting in the aggregate to about £340,000, has been made in this industry, and the number of persons employed is about 500, with an annual wage disbursement of about £80,000. In the manufacture of ordinary black bolts and nuts, about 85 per cent, of the raw material used is Australian steel. This is one of those industries that draws some of its raw material from the iron and steel works at Newcastle, and that is one of the reasons why I, as Minister forTrade and Customs, gave favorable consideration to its request for these duties. It is estimated that the industry uses about 15,000 tons of Australian steel annually. A good deal of competition occurs in the sale of the locally manufactured article. Anybody who has inspected one of the local plants must have noticed the efficient way in which the industry is conducted. An extremely high standard in manufacture has been attained,, yet the prices of Australian bolts and nuts are lower than they have been for the past fifteen years. The report of the Tariff Board, dated the 4th March, 1930, states -The inquiry has disclosed that the bolt and nut-making plant available in Australia is considerably more than adequate for the present output. As a result, much of this plant is only partially used, and the costs of production are on that account excessive by reason of overheads being higher than if the plant were fully occupied. The stimulus given to local production by the demand for bolts and nuts during and immediately after the war, when, on account of disturbed conditions and the shipping shortage, overseas manufacturers were unable to supply the Australian market, led to extensions in the existing plant and the erection of new factories. With the return to normal conditions, prices overseas were greatly reduced, and it was found that the industry in Australia could not maintain its output without further protection.According to that report, the board was of opinion that further protection should be granted as the result of the decision of the Scullin Government. The effect of the increase of the duties was to keep in employment a large number of men who would otherwise have been thrown out of work. These duties show the necessity to afford tariff protection both to primary and secondary industries. I hope that the Minister will not decide later to reduce the rates.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[40]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
150,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"NOCK, Horace","K4X","Riverina","N/A","N/A",809,".- I move -That the item be amended by adding the following: -  And on and after 5th April, 1933 - 182. Bolts, nuts, rivets and metal washers, n.e.i.; screws with nuts or for use with nuts; engineers set screws, ad val. - British, 45 per cent.; general, 65 per cent.A number of points not applicable to fishbolts may be mentioned in connexion with this item. A good argument has been advancedby the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) in favour of the revision of these duties. The honorable member referred to a statement made by the Tariff Board that, as the result of its inquiry, it was disclosed that the bolt and nut-making plants available in Australia were considerably more than sufficient for the present output. That, I think, gives clear evidence that it is unnecessary to impose prohibitive duties such as those provided in this item. Under this method of tariff -making, uneconomic industries are established, and they eventually fail. This has been the experience in regard to the boot industry. High duties encouraged the investment of too much capital in those industries, and after a few years it was found that more boot factories than were required had been established, with the result that many of them had to work part time or close down. The experience in this regard shows the need for more care than has been exercised in the past in tariff revision. When the Tariff Board inquired into the bolt industry, Australian steel was quoted at £12 12s. 6d. a ton, and the price of English steel was £8 2s. 6d., the margin of difference being £4 10s. a ton. Yet protection to the extent of £11 a ton is given to the bolt industry. It is too much. We have been told that most of the bolts are made by automatic machines. Then why is it necessary that the Australian price should be protected to the extent of £11 plus transport costs above the English price? The cost of bolts has a direct effect on the costs of primary production. Every machine on the farm is composed partly of bolts, and replacements are frequently required, the extra, cost of which, due to these duties, has to be borne by the man on the land. The honorable member for Capricornia did not read the following extract from the report of the Tariff Board, although it appears on the same page as the passage quoted by him: -Whilst the cost of these commodities to the consumer has risen as the result of increased duties, the local manufacturers are still unable to compete on the open market against the imported article. . . .It has frequently been claimed in regard to various commodities in respect of which assistance or further assistance under the customs tariff was sought, that the imposition of customs duties has not resulted in increased prices to consumers. Such a position cannot, however, be maintained in the case of bolts and nuts . .It is obvious that the cost to consumers of the duty on bolts and nuts has not been fully compensated for by the benefits conferred by the local industry.These facts must not be overlooked, and they serve to justify my request for a revision of these duties. When one compares the prices of bolts and nuts here and overseas one sees that the reduction since the presentation of the boards report has been very small. The Australian price of 2¼-in. to 3-in. bolts and nuts is 36s. per cwt., compared with the English f.o.b. price of 19s. 6d. per cwt. The Australian price of5/8in. bolts and nuts is 32s. 8d. per cwt., while the English f.o.b. price is 16s. 6d. per cwt. In the case of¾in. bolts the prices are 30s. and 15s. 6d. per cwt. respectively. No matter in what lines we compare prices, there is almost invariably this margin of difference, ranging from 80 to 100 per cent. Since March, 1930, when the boards report was presented, the price of the steel used for making bolts has dropped by £1 12s. 6d. a ton. It takes about 1¼ tons of steel to make a ton of bolts, and, therefore, the advantage due to the reduction of the price of steel on1¼ tons is £2. In addition to that, a material reduction of wages has occurred. There has also been a big reduction of interest, and yet the reduction of the price of bolts is only 26s. 8d. a ton to persons who had contracts with the bolt manufacturers, while the list price to-day is practically the same as it was in 1930. This proves that high protection which places a prohibition upon the entry into Australia of any goods that would ensure reasonable competition with local manufacturers, merely results in keeping up the local price. When high prices are maintained despite the reduction of interest, wages, and the cost of raw material, it is time the Government paid attention to the need for affording some protection to the public.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[41]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The arguments advanced by me with regard to fishbolts are applicable to this item also. The Tariff Board has inquired into this industry, which has been in operation in Australia for many years. The report shows that the following firms are manufacturing these goods in Australia: - McPhersons Proprietary Limited, H. V. McKay Proprietary Limited, G. E. Sewell Proprietary Limited, Enfield Bolt and Nut Works, Abbotsford Manufacturing Company, Commonwealth Telegraph Supplies Limited, Brown and Dureau Limited, Duly and Hansford, Automatic Engineering Company Limited, Australian Insulator Iron Works Limited, Lowe Brothers Limited, and N.

153,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WHITE, Thomas","KZR","N/A","N/A","N/A",810,"- The present prices are attributable to a great extent to the limited business being done by local manufacturers; we cannot attribute them entirely to the tariff. Owing to the general depression, the local firms are not getting the full advantage of the present duties. The Tariff Board made strong criticism of these firms; but I point out that if the honorable member asks for prices he will find that all the firms in the local market are competing keenly with one another, and some are having a hard time. The board pointed out in its report -If by reason of the granting of additional protection the production in Australia of bolts and nuts is increased to the extent it is anticipated it will, then the following advantages should result: -A substantial increase in the number of employees directly engaged in the bolt and nut industry, with an increase in the aggregate wages paid of approximately £50,000 per annum.Are not honorable members anxious that we shall find as much employment as possible for Australians? I urge the honorable member for Riverina not to jeopardize employment by persisting in his amendment. I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that the duties imposed are the fixed rates  or the ad valorem rates. Both rates are not applicable to this item. The board gives these other pertinent reasons -A reduction in the cost of bolts and nuts to consumers by reason of decreased cost of production due to increased output.A demand by the bolt and nut industry for a further quantity of Australian steel estimated at 7,000 tons per annum over and above the quantity hitherto used in that industry.An increased demand for materials used in packing bolts and nuts for distribution.The increased demand for Australian steel will no doubt bring down the cost of wire netting and barbed wire to the farmers, because the greater the turnover the cheaper the cost of production. This is an old-established industry, not one of mushroom growth.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[42]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
154,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PATERSON, Thomas","KXT","Gippsland","N/A","N/A",811,".- The Minister has used as an argument in favour of the retention of the present duties the fact that this is an old established industry. We have frequently heard as an argument in favour of a duty the statement that an industry was just beginning, and was getting on its feet, but this is the first time we have heard it stated that an industry, because it is old and well established, is deserving of a higher rate of protection than when it was new and undeveloped. This industry is old enough to have grown feet on which it can stand without assistance. A few years ago, there was a duty on this item of 35 per cent. British ; to-day it is11s. per cwt., or 45 per cent., whichever is the greater. Evidently the older the industry becomes the more help it needs. Some of these industries never seem to get beyond the stage when they need to be spoon fed, and the bigger they get the more spoon-feeding they need. The Ministers assertion that this is an optional duty, and not an addition to the fixed rate is self-evident, and merely demonstrates the extreme reasonableness of the honorable members amendment.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[43]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
155,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"NAIRN, Walter","JVR","Perth","N/A","N/A",811,".- The Minister used another argument which seemed to me to be remarkable. He said that the local factories had been equipped with plant to turn out what used to be Australias normal requirements, but that, with the falling off of demand, overhead costs had increased in ratio to production, and that that explained why there had not been a substantial reduction of prices in Australia. He urged that we should give the local factories all the business they were able to cope with and prices would come down. The true interpretation of the Ministers contention is that there is no real competition in Australia. Although business is slack, prices have not come down, because high overhead costs must be met, and because factories have been established in excess of public requirements. If there were real internal competition, and the local factories were able to supply more than the local demand, prices would inevitably come down. It is unfair to the public that they should be denied the benefit of cheaper prices merely because the manufacturers have loaded themselves with heavy overhead costs. Prices outside Australia have fallen, but they have been maintained here, and the only conclusion one can come to is that the prohibitive duties imposed on imported articles have enabled Australian manufacturers to keep up their prices.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[44]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have lately heard grumblings from the honorable members party because there is talk of lifting the embargo on potatoes from a sister dominion, and we had an eloquent speech from the honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Nock) in favour of the protection of the rice industry, which happens to be centred in his electorate.

Bolts and nuts are of the greatest importance to primary producers. Owing to the nature of their work, there is severe wear and tear on machinery, and the renewal of bolts and nuts is constantly going on. Naturally, the man on the land looks on this duty as increased taxation on his produce, and so it is. Honorable members opposite argue, of course, that the fostering of Australian industries provides employment for the people of Australia. That is so, but there is no necessity to encourage Australian industry at the expense of the man on the land to quite so great an extent as is being done to-day. If we regard the tariff as a form of taxation, it becomes evident that the higher the taxes, the greater is the volume of unemployment.

The manufacturers of deck spikes claimed that their manufacture was so closely related to the manufacture of bolts and nuts as to justify the granting of the same measure of protection to both. The Australian requirements of deck spikes are about 300 tons annually. The raw material used is Australian steel, which is purchased from the iron and steel works at Broken Hill. The present duties were imposed by the Scullin Government because it was believed that their imposition would lead to additional employment, or would keep those employed who would otherwise lose their jobs. Honorable members, by studying the Tariff Boards report, can see that there is plenty of local competition, which will ensure that consumers are not charged too much. At least nine Australian firms are engaged in the production of deck spikes, including Latrobe in Tasmania. The Tariff Board, on page 7 of its report, states -Assurances have been given by Australian manufacturers that they will not take advantage of any increased duty granted to increase their selling prices.I should like to learn from the Minister what methods have been adopted to find out whether that undertaking has bee carried out.

British and 35 per cent, general tariff; they are now 45 per cent, and 65 per cent, respectively. These higher duties were imposed by the Scullin Administration, and have had beneficial results, in that they have provided employment for a number of workers. Although not in itself a big industry, the manufacture of eyelets and eyelet hooks is one of a number of small industries which, in the aggregate, employ some thousands of persons, and are of considerable benefit to this country. The manufacture of eyelets in Australia was pioneered by Eyelets Proprietary Limited, of Windsor, Melbourne, which commenced operations in 1924. Beginning with a staff of five employees, the factory has increased until now 70 operatives have full time employment in it. These goods are used largely by the boot and shoe trade, and in the manufacture of tents, felt hats, stationery, clothing and radio goods. Since the increased protection was afforded to this industry, the Victorian company has expended a considerable sum on plant and machinery. There are now two additional manufacturers of these goods in Australia - one in Adelaide and the other in Sydney. In the manufacture of eyelets and eyelet hooks Australian materials, including brass wire, brass strip, copper strip, celluloid solvent, lacquers and cartons are used. In the event oi war, the plant of the Melbourne company could, at a few hours notice, be diverted to the production of detonators, percussion caps, and equipment fasteners. I hope that the Minister will not interfere with this industry. Some continuity of fiscal policy must be assured to these small industries if they are to develop. A larger output would enable them to reduce their overhead costs, with a resultant benefit to consumers.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[49]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As each item deals with a new subject there has been no repetition. Before the Scullin Government imposedthese higher duties, school chalks were imported from overseas, but they are now manufactured in Australia. If we are to educate our young people to buy goods made in their own country, we must start while they are still attending our schools. The school chalks made in Australia are manufactured from gypsum obtained from the gypsum fields of Yorke Peninsula in South Australia, the process of manufacture taking place in Melbourne. At least 95 per cent. of the raw materials, together with the boxes, cases or other containers, are of Australian origin; the balance comprises a small percentage of colouring material which must necessarily be imported. The Tariff Board, in its report on this item, says that since Messrs. James Bell and Company, the principal manufacturers of school chalks in Australia, commencedoperations in 1925, there has been a decided downward trend of prices. That is important, in view of the oft-repeated statement by supporters of the present Government, that the establishment of factories in Australia leads to higher prices for the goods they produce. After an investigation, the Scullin Government decided to give this industry adequate protection. Various government departments, wholesalers and consumers, have testified to the excellent quality of the local product. The education departments of the several States endeavour to impress upon the minds of the scholars attending public schools the wisdom of buying goods manufactured in Australia, and it is highly desirable that they should be consistent and use Australian made school chalk. The nations shoppers can do much to provide employment in Australia by buying Australian made goods.Sub-item agreed to.Item 231, sub-item (g1, 2) (Paints and colours).","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[49]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This paint manufacturing industry already employs about 1,200 Australians, and produces paints, enamels and varnishes to the value of over £1,500,000 per annum. There is keen competition among the Australian manufacturers of these commodities, and consequently there is no need to import any of them from other countries. The value of the paint manufacturing industry to the Australian linseed oil industry may be judged from the sales of linseed oil to the Australian manufacturers of paint. One crusher in Sydney sells to them 54,000 gallons of linseed oil monthly and another crusher sells 18,000 gallons a month. There are several other smaller crushers operating in different parts of the Commonwealth. Under normal conditions, between 800,000 gallons and 1,000,000 gallons of linseed oil are used each year in the Australian paint manufacturing industry. That these duties have the approval of the Tariff Board, should convince honorable members opposite that they are well justified.Sub-item agreed to.Item 232, sub-items (a) (b) agreed to.Division 8. - -EARTHENWARE, Cement, China, Glass and Stone.Items 237 (o), 240 (b 1) and 244 (b) agreed to.Items 251, sub-item (c) (Bottle stoppers).","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[49]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Since the higher duties have been in operation, Eyelets Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne, have expended over £1,000 in the supply of additional plant for the manufacture of bottle stoppers. The companys increased output has resulted in lower production costs, thereby enabling it to reduce its selling prices from 3£d. to 3$d. per stopper throughout Australia. Prior to the higher duties coming into force, American stoppers sold in Australia for 3|d. each. Australian stoppers are considered by the leading manufacturers of hot water bottles to be equal to any imported stoppers. As in the case of other industries, the manufacture of stoppers provides a market for Australian copper strip, brass wire, rubber washers and cartons. In its report on this item the Tariff Board stated -Taking into consideration the quality of local stoppers, the price at which such are being sold, the ability of the applicant company to manufacture the requirements of Australia, and the fact that no one appeared to oppose the application, the board is of opinion that the request for the increased rates of duty on stoppers for hot water bags should be granted.This is another instance Of the duties imposed by the Scullin Administration being supported by the Tariff Board.Sub-item agreed to.Item 255, sub-items (a) (b) (Glue, cements and prepared adhesives, n.e.i.).","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[49]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As the honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) has said, the duties in respect to this item were imposed by the Scullin Government and endorsed by the Tariff Board. The item has not again been referred, to the Tariff Board because the companies manufacturing these commodities are carrying out their undertaking not to increase prices. The prices charged by them for their output are reasonable. These are valuable industries which use the by-products of some of our primary industries. Ultimately this item will be referred to the Tariff Board for consideration in connexion with the Ottawa agreement, but for no other reason. When the Tariff Boards further report is received, it will be brought before Parliament.Sub-items agreed to.Item 259 (Roofing slates, n.e.i.).","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[50]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The increased duties imposed by the Scullin Administration had a very beneficial effect on the local industry. The . raw material is quarried at Goulburn, New South Wales, and the roofing of government buildings in Canberra and many in New South Wales and Victoria has been carried out with slate produced from the Goulburn quarries. The capital invested in the industry is £20,000, and increased turnover is essential to its being successfully carried on. Although the Australian price is lower than that of the imported article, there is an unaccountable prejudice against the local product, and unless the existing protection is maintained, there is a possibility of the industry being seriously injured. Unfortunately, this prejudice against the Australian product is fairly general, but the high standard of efficiency aimed at in Australian industries is gradually breaking down this harmful attitude on the part of the buying public. This is one of those industries that need continued protection, so that they may capture the whole of the Australian market. The item is listed for further consideration by the Tariff Board, but I hope that nothing will be done to interfere with the measure of protection now given- to the industry.Item agreed to.Item 262, sub-item (e) agreed to.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[51]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Importations come principally from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States of America. Cresylic acid, like carbolic acid, is among the valuable chemicals extracted from coal tar. It is a liquid, which, when pure, is three times as powerful a germicide as carbolic acid. It is the essential constituent of lysol, as well as other surgical and veterinary preparations, and is largely used in sheep dip because of its antiseptic and insecticidal properties. Works for the refining of cresylic acid were established in 1929, and a plant laid down for the production of 80,000 gallons per annum, which was considered to be a fair estimate of the normal Australian requirements. The enterprise was undertaken after most exhaustive research to obtain an economical method for the manufacture of high- grade cresylic acid from inferior qualities of creosote oil, which are almost entirely produced in Australia from vertical retort tar. Creosote lime and sundry materials used in manufacture are of Australian origin, and represent 80 per cent, of the raw materials used. The balance, soda, is obtained from the United Kingdom. The capital employed in the industry is £40,000 ; the value of the plant is £17,000, and that of the buildings, £7,000. It provides considerable employment, both directly and indirectly, to our people. To meet the requirements of consumers, the local cresylic acid is manufactured to four different specifications or grades. The present protection is necessary to enable this industry to progressively develop. Any alteration of the existing duty would result in decreased production, idleness of working and experimental plants, and consequent unemployment. We cannot afford, at the present time, to throw any Australian operatives out of work. I hope that the Minister will stay his hand with regard to this item which, I am informed, is to be referred to the Tariff Board.Sub-item agreed to.Item 275, sub-item (d) (Pyrites).","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[52]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But it will be necessary for the interests concerned to enter into long contracts for the importation of pyrites for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. When I brought this matter to the notice of the Government a couple of years ago, it was stated that it would be necessary to have contracts ranging from eight to ten years, and that we should have from 70,000 tons to 80,000 tons of shipping coming to Western Australian ports with pyrites. Unless those vessels could get wheat or wool cargoes here they would have to return in ballast. As the matter is of considerable importance to Western Australia, I shall be glad to hear what the Minister has to say concerning the attitude of the department to the proposal.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[53]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The item gives effect to a recommendation made by the Tariff Board some time ago.

176,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",816,".- Sub-item f deals with hydrogen peroxide, the duties on which were increased by the Scullin Administration from an ad valorem rate of 25 per cent. British and 35 per cent. general, to fixed rates of1s. 3d. per gallon, British, and1s. 6d. per gallon, general. The manufacture in Australia of hydrogen peroxide was commenced shortly after the outbreak of war, but it soon became apparent that, before the local industry could capture the Australian market, fixed duties were necessary. Some years ago, hydrogen peroxide was made in ten volume strength, which was costly to ship, but later a method of producing 100-volume strength was discovered, whereby nine-tenths of the freight was saved, and foreign makers got through the then existing protection to this Australian war-time industry. Thanks to the inventive genius of our Australian chemists, the method of producing 100-volume strength was perfected, and recognizing the importance of this discovery to Australia, a higher and more effective protection was granted after full inquiry by the Tariff Board. Expensive and most modern plant has been installed to meet Australian requirements under most economical working methods. Hydrogen peroxide has two important uses - medicinal and commercial. It possesses very high antiseptic qualities, and is used in connexion with operations. Used com mercially, peroxide plays an important part in the bleaching of all classes of material, including wool, cotton or silk. Ivory, and even tripe, are treated with peroxide. Medicinal-quality peroxide is now sold to the public at a lower price than before the duty, when the German and British manufacturers were supplying this market. Technical-quality peroxide is selling at 2s., as compared with 2s. 6d. for the imported article. Increasing output and sales of by-product would enable further price reductions in the near future. Barium sulphate, precipitated, a by-product of hydrogen peroxide, is now being produced equal in analysis to the imported article, and the selling price is the same as that obtaining in England. This new industry will be of considerable advantage to local paint, ink, paper, and rubber manufacturers. The peroxide trade in Europe is in the hands of an amalgamation of English and German interests. The principal Australian manufacturers are now associating themselves with the amalgamation referred to, and will have the advantage of the most up-to-date information from the scientists in Great Britain and Germany. The managing director of the Australian company is now on his way to England to complete negotiations between the British and Australian interests. Local manufacturers gave an undertaking to the Scullin Government and to the Tariff Board to sell at a given price, and although since then costs, through taxation and exchange, have risen 30 per cent., they have kept faith, and have sold the local article at the agreed upon price, putting all their energy into economy of production, and making saleable their by-product. Arrangements are now being made to export to New Zealand and the near eastern countries of Asia. Since protection was given to the industry, prices have been reduced, and are now below the prices charged for the imported article when importing agents had the whole of the Australian market to themselves. This industry is another link in the chain of evidence in support of the wisdom of the Scullin Governments tariff policy.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[55]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

British, and1¼d. per lb. general, or ad valorem 15 per cent. British, and 30 per cent. general. The fixed rates would not appear to be heavy, but when it is remembered that from 4 lb. to 6 lb. of arsenate of lead is used in 40 gallons of water as an orchard spray, it will be seen that it is costing the orchardist from 6d. to 8d. a cask extra. In ordinary circumstances, this might not be regarded as a heavy tax, but these are not Ordinary times. Orchardists, like other primary producers, are facing grave difficulties, and the duties on this spraying material work out at about 5s. a day, which is nearly as much as the wages paid to an orchard hand, including keep. This tax on a preparation used for the control of orchard pests, besides being uneconomic, penalizes those who are endeavouring to develop the land industries with a view to exporting their surplus products, thus helping Australia to meet her overseas obligations. Trees have to be sprayed three or four times in a season, and the duty on spray represents an added cost equivalent to the wages of one employee.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[56]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am informed by a medical man that Australian bismuth cannot be satisfactorily used for certain medical purposes, and that the standard drug is Merx bismuth salts, a German preparation. We should not make the cost of medicines so high that poor people cannot afford to buy them.

Representations were made to the Scullin Government that these products can be satisfactorily supplied by Australian factories, and the former ad valorem rates of free, 10 per cent. and 15 per cent. were replaced by fixed rates of 5s. and 7s. per lb. The manufacture of menthol and thymol is a highly-specialized industry, and there are only a limited number of firms engaged in its production in England, Germany, France, Switzerland, and America. Natural menthol comes almost entirely from Japan, and is obtained from a plant, and not by chemical manufacture. Australia was the first country to make thymol and menthol by chemical processes from eucalyptus oil. Although the worlds output of thymol is not large, the manufacture of this drug in England was protected as a key industry. This indicates the importance attached to it there. The raw material used by local manufacturers is wholly Australian, eucalyptus oil being the foundation. One German firm uses a different raw material. Prices of the local products have been considerably reduced since the increased duties were imposed. The establishment of works in Australia followed by developments in other countries, enhanced the demand for Australian eucalyptus oil produced from the broad leaf peppermint, prices for export rising fully 50 per cent. Local menthol and thymol are sold at the same price in all capital cities of the Commonwealth. As a result of the customs protection, the Australian manufacturers have increased and improved their plants considerably. Larger and improved stills and reaction vessels have been installed in order to supply Australian requirements. Wholesale chemists in all centres are now using the local menthol and thymol, as are most of the large manufacturing users. This is one of those useful smaller industries which will make Australia more self-contained in war. During the last war, Australia was seriously inconvenienced because certain drugs and chemicals were not produced locally! I, therefore, ask the Minister not to allow the Tariff Board to interfere with this important industry.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[59]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When I was in New Guinea a medical officer told me that he was compelled to purchase his drugs and chemicals in Australia, and for some of them paid prices 300 per cent, in excess of what he would pay for imports from Great Britain. A similar burden is placed on Australian users, and this is not fair to either the hospitals or the poor. I endorse the contention of the honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Blacklow) that sprays used by orchardists should be as cheap as possible, but it is even more important that excessive duties should not be imposed on drugs and chemicals that are essential to the health of the people. The chemists have told me that it is almost impossible to get Australian bismuth, and the cost of the imported article .is unduly high because of these duties.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[60]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
184,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WHITE, Thomas","KZR","Balaclava","UAP","Minister for Trade and Customs",818,". - Arsenate of lead has been reported upon by the Tariff Board whose inquiries showed that Australia is producing all its own requirements, and that imports from abroad are unnecessary. The board stated -The board considers that the. Australian manufacturers of arsenate of lead are entitled to ad valorem rates equal to those accorded to the products above quoted, so far as the intermediate and general tariffs are concerned. As to the British preferential tariff, it is considered that the rate of 15 per cent, should be* sufficient. In the case of arsenate of lead, the board also considers it necessary to provide alternative fixed rate duties, in view pf the possibility of low-priced importations.If the honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Blacklow) finds that the duties on arsenate of lead press unduly on the orchardists in Tasmania, and he can establish a prima facie case for revision, I shall not hesitate to refer the item back to the Tariff Board. A charge of 5s. a day certainly seems a heavy impost on such an industry as orcharding, which is experiencing a lean time. But until a prima facie case against the duties recommended by the board is established, they must remain.Sulphate of magnesia, popularly known as epsom salts, if imported in large packets, is subject to lower duties; therefore, the burden on institutions using it in considerable quantities is not great. The manufacture of thymol is adequately protected. Eucalyptus represents 60 per cent, of the ingredients. This industry is well established and the Tariff Board has reported that the local product is equal to the best imported. Having regard to the fact that the duty on menthol and thymol entering the United Kingdom is 33^ per cent., the rates provided in this schedule are not excessive. The Acting Leader of the Country party (Mr. Paterson) and the honorable member for Boothby (Mr. Price) urged that inquiries be made into the duty on bismuth; and the honorable member for Swan asked whether this commodity was being manufactured economically in Australia. I admit that I have doubts about it. A certain company in Sydney did endeavour to manufacture bismuth, and it spent as much as £80,000 in mining operations. The Tariff Board considered the industry largely from a mining point of view and made certain recommendations. As the negotiations with this company have broken down, and as there is a likelihood that the duty may increase the cost of certain medicines for sick people, I shall accede to the request of the Acting Leader of the Country party, and ask the committee to postpone sub-item n while agreeing to the other sub-items.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[61]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under the 1930 tariff the duty was 5s. per 100 super. feet. While for some purposes Australian timber may be of use for making boxes, generally, and especially for the export trade the imported timber is preferred. I know that a rebate on imported timber can be obtained in respect of the export trade, but there is generally so much trouble in obtaining it that the large number of small exporters do not bother about asking for it. Even with a more moderate tariff a considerable quantity of Australian timber would be used, but in the export trade, which requires boxes of a good pattern, baltic pine is essential. I shall not move any amendment because I realize that the numbers would be against me, but I hope that the Minister will agree to reduce the duty under this sub-item. At one time the honorable member for Echuca (Mr. Hill) told me that the increased cost to the Shepparton canners, because of this increase of duty, was over £8,000. In view of the fact that the duty on foreign timber has been increased from 5s. to 14s. per 100 super. feet, representing an increase of nearly 300 per cent., I ask the Minister to give favorable consideration to my suggestion for a reduction of this duty.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[62]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As he well knows, this is one of the most troublesome items in the tariff schedule. The Scullin Government, realizing that it was impossible to please all sections of the community, stood for preference to the Australian timber industry, and rightly increased the duties. This item was investigated by the Tariff Board, and the duties shown in the schedule were recommended by that body. Any reduction of the tariff would cause absolute consternation to the timber industry. I can quite understand that the Minister would like to refer the item back to the Tariff Board, but even that course would be fraught with danger in view of the changed outlook of the Tariff Board since the ratification of the Ottawa agreement.

Millions of cases are used for the export of our apples, pears, and citrus fruits, and they, are mostly made of Canadian timber, chiefly hemlock and spruce. Quite a number of cases are made from timber cut from local pine forests, but frequently fault is found with them in the overseas markets. I hope that this item will not be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation. I. have had considerable experience in case-making, and have imported millions of feet of timber. It was a great boon to the saw-millers and case-makers of Australia when the Government imposed on timber cut to size for casemaking a duty of 12s. British, and 14s. foreign.

Under article 11 of the United Kingdom and Australia trade agreement, the Minister is bound to refer to the Tariff Board existing duties which affect British trade with Australia; but in the case of the duties now under consideration there is no such obligation upon him, because the timber affected comes from countries other than the United Kingdom; it comes from Scandinavia, Russia, and North America. Under these circumstances, the Minister can make up his mind independent of any requirement of the Ottawa agreement. If he is satisfied that the present duties are justified, he need not refer them back to the Tariff Board. I know of no subject on which the board made a closer investigation, or in which the range of evidence was wider than in connexion with the timber duties. Nearly two pages of the boards report, which was presented in 1930, were occupied in giving a list of the representatives from the different parts of Australia who gave evidence. The honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) has selected an isolated sub-item; but taking the duties as a whole, the board prepared carefully and scientifically a scale of duties which was satisfactory to the industry. The honorable member believes in investigation of duties by the Tariff Board, and I point out that the present duties are those recommended by it after full inquiry. It is easy for honorable members to repeat ex parte statements in this chamber, but I contend that if those statements are contrary to the findings of the board, it would be but fair to refer them to that body for further investigation. Members should not be expected to accept ex parte statements when the persons to whom they are attributed cannot be cross-examined, and it is not reasonable to attempt to use such statements in this chamber with a view to influencing members votes. We should be careful not to accept such statements in preference to the considered judgment of the Tariff Board.In Queensland the present duties have resulted in the opening up of hitherto inaccessible forests, upon which large sums of money have been spent in roadmaking and other developmental works. These operations have been particularly beneficial to men who would otherwise have been unemployed, and it would be a serious mistake to do anything that would check them.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[66]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

These duties, which have been recommended by the Tariff Board, were introduced by a previous ministry, and the present Government is now asking the committee to re-affirm them. I should not have considered it necessary to speak on this matter had it not been for the suggestion that a variation of the duties should be made. The case is perfectly clear for the legitimate encouragement of this important Australian industry. We have often heard it said that the industries that are natural to this country are particularly deserving of protection and development, and that we should not encourage  hot-house  industries. Surely in this great continent, with its immense timber resources, every encouragement should be given to the production of timber suitable for commercial purposes. At the same time we must have regard to the future requirements of the Commonwealth, and we must adopt such a policy as will conserve our forest areas, so that there will be a supply for the future. The Commonwealth Government is trying to encourage a serious outlook in this matter, and the imposition of these timber duties shows that the Government is favorable to a comprehensive forestry policy. I am glad to know that a decided forest conscience has been awakened in Australia. Proof of this is found in the Forestry School that has been established at Canberra, and which is working in co-operation with the forestry authorities in the States. A report recently issued by the Queensland Forestry Department indicates that a national outlook is now being displayed in regard to our large forest areas, and that their complete development is considered necessary. In view of the attitude of the Minister to these duties, I do not consider it necessary further to discuss them. As a general principle, we should recognize that, having enteredinto the Ottawa agreement we are bound by its terms, and, whether we like them or not, we must observe them in spirit; but this committee can make up its own mind in regard to these timber duties. I urge it to stand by one of our great natural industries. The honorable member for Adelaide (Mr. Stacey) is aware of the large areas of softwood plantations that are being developed in South Australia, and in almost every other State a similar story can be told. I hope that the policy of the Government will be to do everything possible to conserve the Australian timber industry, and that the Minister will adhere to the existing duties.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[66]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Protracted negotiations occurred over a period of six or seven months between all sections of the industry in order to get a carefully prepared schedule of duties that were generally satisfactory. Each section put forward its separate requirements, and no finality could be reached until their requests were co-ordinated. Eventually duties were imposed which met with the approval of all, and I do not think that any harm has resulted to the community. Those in the timber industry, in the cities and in the country, all appear to be satisfied.

Differences of opinion exist as to the suitability of hardwood as opposed to softwood for case-making, but, at its 1930 inquiry into the subject, the Tariff Board was impressed with the case for hardwood and recommended the duties which now appear in the schedule. There is no cause for alarm about those duties being reduced. They are not excessively high, and there is no necessity to refer them again to the Tariff Board under the Ottawa agreement, because in this instance the United Kingdom is not a producer.A drawback is granted on all dressed or undressed timber that is imported and used for case-making for export purposes.

I am confident that if any Russian timber has been released it has been done under a security which will safeguard timber interests in the Commonwealth.The honorable gentleman is aware that the Tariff Board inquired into the matter. That board has power to invoke the aid of the Industries Preservation Act, and it will ensure that a price at least equal to the wholesale price charged for Australian timber is paid for that from Russia.

At that time, 70,000,000 superficial feet of Oregon had accumulated in the southern States waiting to be sawn. There is still a good deal of it in Australia entering into competition with our own timbers.Honorable members must realize that consistency is invaluable in fiscal matters. They must realize, too, that the timber industry is of vital importance to every State, particularlythat which is so richly endowed by Providence, Queensland. That State from which I come has millions of feet of timber, equal or superior to anything in the world. In the ornamental section, its maple, walnut and silky oak are without peer; its kauri pine, a splendid softwood, exists in abundance in the far north, and magnificent hardwoods of every description are to be found throughout the State. I am glad that, as a result of the increased duties, people are being encouraged to use hardwoods. There is, however, a false impression that Australian softwoods are scarce.

At the same time, it has been demonstrated that if the southern States desire to purchase Queensland timbers they will be assisted generously by the Queensland Government in the matter of decreased royalties. To their disgrace, the southern States have used oregon from the United States of America extensively, when excellent Australian softwoods of suitable length were available at competitive prices.By urging the Government to instruct the Tariff Board to inquire with a view to allowing oregon to be again imported at a lower rate of duty the honorable member for Boothby (Mr. Price) recently displayed sad ignorance of the position, and of the importance of the timber industry to Australia. He said that there was a factory in his electorate which employed 160 men, who would be benefited ifthe duty on Oregon were reduced. The Australian timber industry employs thousands. Our great mills, which at one time enjoyed a profitable export trade, are making every effort again to compete with the world. There are tremendous forests of hardwoods in Australia virtually untouched, containing timbers unequalled for beauty and durability. Only recently Australian hardwood was used extensively in a great building that has just been completed in the United Kingdom, and writers extolled the beauty of our product. The sooner these facts are realized by Australians generally, the better it. will be for the nation. I have here a telegram from the Timber Merchants Association of Queensland, which also speaks for the timber getters and settlers who have timber to sell. It reads -Associated saw-millers and timber merchants seek your best efforts retain existing duties on all timbers. Ample timber supplies in Australian States to continue to supply the needs of the Commonwealth for very many years.Those are our natural timber resources, without taking into consideration the ultimate results of our re-afforestation efforts. If honorable members would only take the trouble to inquire they would find that Australian timbers are eminently suited for every conceivable purpose, whether for the mining industry or building generally. In Queensland, local hardwoods are used in the mining industry. If honorable members were fully appreciative of the beauties of the panelling of the building in which we conduct our deliberations here, the flooring of Kings Hall, and the furniture which adorns every room, they would realize that we have an industry that is worthy of protection, and would not allow the local market to be flooded with cheap imported timber. We have timbers which make us the envy of other parts of the world. All that is needed is for public men to make known their value. It must be made known if advantage is to be taken of the opportunities for export that will present themselves when other great forests are cut out. The tariff is reasonable, and apparently is just, because no alteration of it is proposed.

It takes 3 super, feet of timber to cut a standard fruit case. That would work out at not more than 16s. per 100 super, feet. Any one who has any acquaintance with the building trade is aware that hardwood timber for building purposes cannot be bought under 24s. per 100 super, feet. By cutting down the timber for the case to a thickness of \ inch, two-thirds of the timber is wasted. I point this out to show what would happen if slats ready for nailing were allowed to come into Australia duty free, or at a low duty. Practically nothing would be obtained for the timber that is cut here for case-making.The honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) stated that hardwood cases were found quite suitable for export. I am unable to agree with him. Overseas markets have asked for what is known as the Canadian case. That is altogether different from the old standard fruit case, which is cut very thin, and which exporters from South Australia have refused to accept.There are many thousands of acres of pine forests in South Australia, but they ~are in the growing stage. The case that is required for the packing of fruit for export is cut from 11-in. timber. That means that the log must have a diameter of about 15 inches. We are cutting boxes chiefly from the thinnings of pine forests, but these are not always suitable for export cases. It would appear that I am arguing against myself, but in reality that is not so. I stated earlier that large quantities of hemlock and spruce had to be imported for casemaking. That timber is allowed into Australia almost duty free, and, so far as South Australia is concerned, those conditions must continue for some considerable time. In years to come, our pine forests will provide suitable timber for the cases that I have mentioned.The honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) referred to the use of hardwoods in the mining industry. If he were to visit Broken Hill, he would find that it has been found necessary there to use softwoods, the reason being that it gives warning of moving ground, whereas hardwood would break without warning.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[73]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

230,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",826,".- This is an industry which was given substantial protection by the Scullin Government. After careful consideration, it proposed that the duties should be increased by the substitution of a fixed duty for the previously existing ad valorem rate. The manufacture of wristlet watches in Australia has had the effect of reducing the price of the imported lines to the public, in addition to building up an important industry in Australia. The price reduction is due to the importers of Swiss watches being compelled to meet the competition of the Australian manufacturers. The imposition of the duty has stopped the flow of cheap nickel wristlet watches into Australia. These watches were coming into this country by thousands, and were a menace to both the trade and the purchasing public. The Retail Jewellers Association informed the Tariff Board that it was anxious to rid itself of the trade in these so-called wristlet watches, where were no more than mechanical toys. The capital invested in this industry in Australia amounts to about £50,000, and the number of persons employed is about 150. The Australian wristlet watch manufacturers are producing all sizes and types necessary to meet the requirements of the public. The rates of duty now operating are those recommended by the Tariff Board in its report of the 3rd June, 1930. One development -of the new tariff is the establishment in Victoria of a working unit of a very old established Swiss firm. The company is trading under the name of the Australian-Swiss Manufacturing Company, at Bendigo, Victoria, and is supplying the market with an article for which there is always a fair demand. A flourishing industry is thus being built up inside the tariff wall. If this can be done in a time of depression, such as we are now passing through, much more could be done in good times. It is surely preferable for us to be giving employment to our people by this means than to be admitting to this country crowds of unemployed workmen from overseas. We need new chimney stacks and new factories in Australia, and we should welcome the old established manufacturing concerns of Switzerland and other continental countries, and of England and America, which establish branches of their various industries in this country.As the result of the wider market secured by the tariff for the Australian wristlet watches, the Victorian manufacturers have been busy improving their plants, and in undertaking the production of a wider range of designs. Handley and Tilley Proprietary Limited, of Abbotsford, Victoria, the largest manufacturers in Australia, report the following reductions of prices below those of last year: -NICKEL AND BASE METAL WATCH CASESGents cases, last year, 4s. each, now 3s. Od. each. Ladies cases, last year, 3s. each, now 2s. Gd. each.SILVER CASESGents cases, last year, 7s. 6d. each, now Ss. each. Ladies cases, last year, 5s. each, now 3s. 3d. each.Gold has increased in cost equal to 4$d. per dwt. 9 carat gold; but, notwithstanding this, the price of 9 carat gold cases has been reduced as follows: -One-hinged, last year, 13s. 6d., now, 13s. Two-hinged, last year, 14s. 6d., now, 13s. 9d.As the increased cost of gold is equivalent to lOd. a case the real reduction is seen to be substantial. Handley and Tilley have a most efficient plant, a large proportion of which is Australian-made and is believed to be equal to the worlds best. The firm is capable of supplying all demands of the trade, and looks forward with confidence to materially increasing its working staff in the near future.In addition to supplying watch cases for the standard type 15-jewel Swiss watches in all sizes and shapes, the Australian manufacturers are now making cases for many high-grade advertised lines, such as the Waltham, Rolex, Elgin, Thommen and Datum, Tavannes and Moeris watches. These are now fitted into and sold in Australian cases. The Australian public benefits alike by the lower prices and by the local makers guarantee.I have made some inquiries to ascertain the growth of employment in this industry m Australia, and I find that the number of employees in the factory of Handley and Tilley Proprietary Limited, at Abbotsford, has increased as follows: -Much of this development is due to the fact that this company has been able to capture the Australian market. It has also been able to increase its output and so reduce the price of its product to the people. I have no doubt that the experience of the Bendigo firm has been similar.There is one aspect of the subject, however, to which the Government should give attention. The margin of protection allowed by the tariff introduced by the Scullin Government has been greatly reduced by the imposition of a tariff of 15 per cent., plus primage on all wrist watch movements that are brought into the Commonwealth to be cased in Australian-made cases. This counteracts, to a great extent, the margin of protection. It would be a very serious matter for the industry if this margin r were again reduced.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[77]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

233,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HARRISON, Eric","KNT","Bendigo","UAP","N/A",828,". - The watch cases being manufactured in Australia at present compare favorably with those being made in other parts of the world. This industry is in its infancy. Only four factories have so far been established in this country, but it is gratifying- to know that they seem to be soundly established. The class of work they do ranges from the very cheapest type of watch case to platinum and diamond cases which are very fair specimens of the jewellers art. Many varieties of cases are to-day being manufactured entirely in Australia. The patterns are being drawn, and the dies cut here. Precision work of this kind may be very valuable to this country if a war should ever occur, for it may not be generally realized that a watch factory can easily be turned into a fuse factory. The number of persons engaged in the manufacture of watch cases has undoubtedly grown, and the resultant increase of output has made possible a reduction of prices. The building up of an export trade with neighbouring countries is now more than a possibility, for it has already started. It seems that we may be able to outsell our opponents overseas before very long. It is true that our factories were started almost exclusively with foreign labour, but these foreign workmen took young Australians in hand for training, and my knowledge of the work of the Bendigo factory justifies me iri saying that the Australians who have been so trained will before very long be capable of teaching other Australians this very accurate work. . The reduction of price in this article is welcomed, and is entirely due to the increased output of the factories. Possibly very few people realize that Australia requires nearly 500,000 watches a year. I believe that we are doing the right thing in encouraging this industry, and in seeking to obtain our share of the trade in the lower priced watches. The demand for higher price watches is not very great in this country. The making of such watches is, to a large extent, the speciality of a few firms which produce the hand-made article. In regard to the importation of watch movements, I wish to say that the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White) and his predecessor in office have always been considerate when I have approached them. They have treated the watch movements as the raw material of the watch-case manufacturing industry, and have allowed them in under by-law. I am glad that the Government has seen fit to maintain the existing rate of duty. I believe that in establishing and fostering this industry we are doing something of great value to Australia.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[78]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As the honorable member for Bendigo (Mr. E. F. Harrison) has said, the Government has endeavoured to cheapen the cost of these lines by admitting the watch movements free under departmental by-law. In case the interjection that I made while the honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) was speaking might be misunderstood, I wish to make it clear that by the operation of the Ottawa formula there is now a duty of 15 per cent, on foreign watch movements, plus 4 per cent, primage. The British movements, of course, come in duty free, but are subject to 4 per cent. * primage. The Tariff Board inquired into the subject of nickel-plated watch cases, but not into that of nickel silver cases. It was said that this line was not worth making. But that subject has now been referred to the board, and I hope that its report will come to hand before very long.This duty is, of course, to some extent, also in a nature of a revenue item, as is the case with all jewellery lines.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[79]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

240,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",829,".- This item shows an increase on the duties imposed by the Scullin Government. The footwear industry is important to Australia. The duties were increased by the Scullin Administration from 35 per cent. and 45 per cent. to 45 per cent. and 60 per cent. They are now 45 per cent. and 65 per cent.This is not a new industry. It has been established in Australia for 50 years or more and its importance can be judged from the fact that there are 314 factories, employing 13,906 persons. Salaries and wages amount to £2,109,539, and the annual value of the output is £6,301,133. The industry is capable of supplying the whole of the requirements of the people in sufficient quantities, and at prices which impose no hardship on the consumer. There is practically no class of shoe, from the lightest infants shoes to the heaviest type of working boot, that is not made in bulk, under extremely competitive conditions which keep prices at a low level. There has been no action on the part of manufacturers to take advantage of the increased duties. On the contrary, since 1930, prices have decreased very considerably, so keen is the competition within the trade. The latest available figures, those for 1930-31, show that the industry absorbed 14,040,134 lb. of sole leather and 20,228,083 square feet of upper leathers, and as quite 90 per cent. of this raw material is of Australian production, the benefit to primary producers is apparent. After an inquiry into the question of the necessity for increased duties embodied in the tariff proposals of November, 1929, the Tariff Board in its report stressed the efficiency of the industry, and stated that those responsible for its development might well be proud of the progress made. It was further stated that the tariff had assisted in building up a very important Australian industry. The duties imposed have not been so high as to be prohibitive, but have been so adjusted as to enable the local manufacturers successfully to compete with products imported from all other countries. The high quality of tanned leathers produced by Australian tanneries can compare favorably with the best products from European countries. For many years it was thought by boot manufacturers that they could not get anything to take the place of German calf and other leathers from abroad. In the last few years, however, they have called on Australian tanneries for their requirements, and my recent inspection of boot factories has convinced me that the manufacturers are well satisfied with the local product. Unfortunately our exports to New Zealand have fallen off very considerably, due to the fact that New Zealand has now established its own factories. There are some people in Australia who will pay £3 3s. or £4 4s. a pair for American or English shoes, and some ladies are prepared to buy ballet shoes from Switzerland. They, however, are unnecessarily fastidious, because they could be quite well suited by the products of Australian factories. I hope that the Minister will not send this item for review by the Tariff Board in accordance with articles 9 to 14 of the Ottawa agreement. We know that there are certain British manufacturers who would like to exploit the Australian market; but the last Government realized the importance of keeping the work in Australia. The honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) and others were a party to increasing the protection afforded this industry, and helped to keep the trade in Australia. Had that not been done, thousands of workmen would have been thrown out of employment. I trust that nothing will be done to decrease the duty, and interfere with the protection of an industry which deserves so well of the country.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[80]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The boot and shoe industry was established long before the honorable member was born. It was an efficient industry in Victoria in pre-federation days, and supplies 95 per cent. of the Australian market. It is an industry of which we may be proud, and local competition is sufficient to keep prices within bounds. At one time Australia had an export trade in boots and shoes, not only to New Zealand, but also to Russia and other countries far afield. Our costs have increased considerably since then, and we have lost a great deal of our export trade ; but even now, with our slightly depreciated currency, there is an opportunity in the East to re-establish a trade overseas. The duties in the schedule are reasonable, and the Government at all times supports reasonable duties to protect efficient Australian industries.Item agreed to.Item 331, sub-item (d) (Rubber and rubber manufactures).Compounded rubber, per lb., British 2½d.; general, 2½d.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS (1932-1933)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[81]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
