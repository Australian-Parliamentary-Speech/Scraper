That the Constitution of the Commonwealth has served Australia well, is not out of date, has proved to be flexible and should not be radically altered.2. Our deep concern that the recommendations of the Constitutional Commission and its advisory committees which propose radical changes to the Constitution are threatening to reduce our rights as citizens of the Commonwealth.3. Our strongest opposition to any referendum proposals of the Hawke Government which gives more power to the government and less to the people and which concentrates that power in Canberra at the expense of the States and weakens the role of the Senate.To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.We the undersignedExpress concern over the further delay until 28 April 1988 of the Report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material.Call upon the Senate to request the Government as an urgent interim measure to immediately adopt the recommendations and respond positively to the observations of the Senate Select Committee on Video Material by:ensuring that all videos currently on the market which contain a level of violence beyond the current Film Censorship Board guidelines be withdrawn from sale or hire;placing a moratorium on the sale and hire of X-rated videos;promulgating regulations to prevent the transmission by post from Canberra of videos which are banned in the States.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:1. the right of the people of a country to make law independent of politicians should be a basic and independent right;2. consequently there is an urgent need for constitutional reforms.Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, should:support the Constitutional Alteration (Electors Initiative) 1987 Bill to alter the constitution so as to vest in the electors power to propose laws and to approve or disapprove such proposed laws.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.We, the undersigned citizens, respectfully showeth:That we express grave concern about the public release of confidential medical information by the Government, sufficient to enable the public identification of Doctors and their patients and calls upon the Parliament to censure all those involved in this gross abuse of the privacy of all Australians.And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.To The Honourable The President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:-But for a High Court decision narrowly favouring the Federal Government, 20 000 years old archaeological cave sites near the Franklin River, Tasmania, would have been destroyed, like a United Kingdom Government unable to stop a Wiltshire authority from clearing Stonehenge for a freeway.

It would detract from the unique status of the National Capital-a status recognised and maintained by every preceding Government.2.

It would be likely to exacerbate existing social problems and create new ones.We urge you to recognise the devastating effects of gambling in the community and the opposition of the majority of voters in the A.C.T. to the establishment of a casino; and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:That there is widespread concern by farmers and consumers about the proposal to irradiate food in Australia.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:1. that the public is overwhelmingly opposed to Telecoms plans to introduce time charges for local calls;2. that while Telecom remains a public enterprise, it must be accountable to the public, its owners; and3. while Telecom retains a statutory monopoly which shields it from the discipline of competition, it should not be unilaterally allowed to impose extortionate charges upon the public.Your petitioners therefore respectfully call upon all members of the Senate in Parliament assembled to take action to prevent Telecom introducing time charges for local calls.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:That we are concerned that the Judeo-Christian moral values which have been fundamental in our laws and education systems since the foundation of the country are now being undermined in the current practice of law making, and we are concerned that the values of the secular-humanistic philosophy have taken their place, therefore jeopardizing the moral climate of our society and contributing towards immorality and violence in our society.Your petitioners therefore ask the Senate for the restoration of Judeo-Christian laws and moral values.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.The petition of the undersigned expresses concern that some scientists in Australia are intent on undertaking destructive experimentation on human embryos. This subject was examined exhaustively by the 1985-86 Senate Select Committee on Senator Harradines Human Embryo Experimentation Bill which received 270 submissions and more than 2,000 pages of evidence. The report of the Senate Committee recommended in October 1986 that the Commonwealth Government make unlawful any destructive experiment which frustrated the development of the human embryo.Your petitioners therefore request the Senate and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to:Implement without delay the major recommendation of the Senate Select Committee to outlaw destructive experiments on human embryos.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the House assembled.The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:That we most strongly oppose the process of `food irradiation by Cobalt 60 or any other radioactive substance.That we oppose the introduction of regulations that will facilitate the food irradiation process being permitted by State Governments.That we express our deep concern at this attempt to extend the use of radioactive substances and exposure of workers to radiation.Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate ban the importation of radioactive Cobalt 60 or other radioactive substances for the purpose of food irradiation and disallow regulations permitting the irradiation of food in Australia.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Canberra respectfully shows:The ACT Schools Authority has acted in an unfair and improper manner in rejecting, without notice or justification, the Planning Criteria of its Draft Plan ``Community Schools for Canberra 1989-2000, in which context it had invited communities to respond and in reaching decisions that conflict completely with those criteria.The ACT Schools Authority has acted in this way, has set a precedent for arbitrary school reorganization throughout the whole of Canberra, in which schools can be closed at any time without prior notice or consultation, and without effective justification.The Page Community has been denied natural justice by the decision to close its neighbourhood school, because that decision was made without warning, without consultation, and without right of appeal.The Page Community is the only one in Canberra that has been given no opportunity to respond to a specific draft proposal for closure of its school.Your petitioners therefore pray that:The Senate note our strong and united protest at the ACT Schools Authoritys decision to close Page Primary School.Noting that, the ACT Schools Authority identified only two options for school reorganization in the South Belconnen area, and that it has chosen to implement neither, and that the people of the ACT are shortly to be given the possibility of self government; the Senate resolve that no South Belconnen schools be closed until the ACT Schools Authority has:(a) developed a complete and integrated plan for the educational needs of the South Belconnen area;(b) developed and publicized educational and social criteria for maintaining, relocating, reorganizing or closing schools;(c) assessed all schools against these criteria;(d) presented these results for public review, with a full range of options; and(e) allowed reasonable time for community consultation prior to decisions being taken and implemented.And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth:We ask that the Federal Government take immediate action to arrest the spread of violent and pornographic printed and video material within Australia and to have existing material withdrawn to a point where this country once more achieves acceptable standards of social and moral behaviour. As a first step towards this objective, we ask that the Government immediately:(a) amend the Customs Prohibited Imports Regulations to once more render it illegal for excessively violent and pornographic material to be imported into Australia, and(b) amend the ACT Classification of Publications Ordinance to prohibit the importation into, production within, and distribution from the ACT of R and X-rated video material and pornographic literature.We urge the Government to recognise that it is inappropriate for the National Capital to be the distribution point from which violent and pornographic material can legally be sent by mail order to residents of the various States in which this material has been banned, and to take the steps necessary to redress this situation.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

26,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BUTTON","4F4","VIC","ALP","N/A",3077,"—Strangely enough, I am aware of the figures for the March quarter in respect of business investment. While the real total of investment declined in that quarter, it represented an adjustment from the unusually high December quarter rather than an indication of any longer downward trend. However, the preliminary expectations data for 1988-89 indicate an annual increase of 13 per cent over the 1987-88 outcome. The March quarter Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey showed a more positive result for manufacturing investment, however-much more satisfactory than was recorded in December. It appears that as the impact of the October stock market crash recedes manufacturing is taking a more optimistic view of its longer term investment requirements.Manufacturing reversed its investment decline in the December quarter to raise real investment levels by 16 per cent in the March quarter, and a further increase in real manufacturing investment is expected in the June quarter. It can be expected that the changes implemented by the Government in the May economic statement should provide a positive environment for business investment in the next financial year. Following the release of the May statement on Wednesday of last week it was heartening, for example, to see that ICI Australia Ltd announced a very substantial investment in Gladstone in Queensland. The Managing Director, Dr Michael Deerley, in a Press release issued on Thursday, said:the gladstone venture was a unique opportunity for ICI Australia to invest in the rapidly booming gold industry. The Australian economic environment has encouraged ICI Australia to selectively expand capital expenditure and the companys plans for this year total $250m.I mentioned that only as it is supportive of the estimate by the ABS for investment in the June quarter.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Nevertheless, I have undertaken to get them as speedily as possible, possibly before the end of Question Time and certainly by tomorrow. However, I can answer the last question, about guidelines relating to the deportation of foreign citizens whose personal safety is threatened.In relation to this case, the Department has no knowledge as to what treatment the man received upon or since his return to Iran from India in 1985. The present procedures for the deportation or exclusion of a foreign citizen require the consideration of any claims he or she may make in relation to his or her personal safety. Where an application is made for refugee status and the person has no claim for refuge from another signatory country, that application is decided by the Minister or his delegate in the light of an assessment by the Determination of Refugee Status Committee. That Committee is an interdepartmental body set up to advise the Minister in relation to claims for recognition of refugee status by claimants in Australia. A foreign citizen who claims fear for his or her personal safety in an overseas country is not deported or excluded except as is consistent with Australias international obligations following consideration of the particular situation.I thank Senator Jenkins for her patience and I anticipate having the remainder of the answer by tomorrow at the latest.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

30,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BUTTON","4F4","VIC","ALP","N/A",3078,"—I can confirm those things. The industrial disputes figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for January 1988 confirm the significant and continuing improvement in industrial relations under this Government. They represent a continuation of the downward trend in disputation levels evident over the last five months. This is in complete rebuttal of Senator Chaneys claims made last March, in a Press release of 23 March 1988, that ABS statistics were confirming a deteriorating trend in industrial disputation. The January figure of 29,200 working days lost is 66 per cent lower than the corresponding figure for December 1987, and 65 per cent lower than the 20-year January average. The dramatic improvement in industrial relations since the election of this Government is shown even more clearly by the monthly average of working days lost, which has dropped by 54 per cent to that experienced under the previous Government.On the second part of the question, the current two-tier system has resulted in many cases in a greater understanding between management and employees. I think this is recognised by both management and employees. It has provided an important impetus for management and trade unions to discuss productivity and efficiency measures and has opened the way for further consultation and cooperative effort. The emphasis on industry and enterprise negotiations could have resulted in a greater degree of disputation at that level during the second-tier negotiations, but, as the figures show, it has not, and indeed the reverse has occurred.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has been alleged consistently by the Opposition, and I think supported by independent observers who have been quoted in this debate, that the Government has been thoroughly dishonest in its approach to these constitutional amendments.What the Government has done is to put apparently bland questions to the Australian people which do not represent the full import of the constitutional proposals which are being put forward. In particular, the first proposal, which would weaken the role of this Senate, has been put forward as a proposal which on the face of it relates only to the extension of the term of the Parliament when it is in part a proposal for a reduction in the term of this part of the Parliament. In exactly the same way we have condemned the Constitution Alteration (Fair Elections) Bill as being hypocritical because, quite clearly, the Government proposed to apply a rule to the upper and lower Houses of the State parliaments which it was not seeking and should not have been seeking to apply to this Senate and the House of Representatives. On those grounds we have condemned the Government for its hypocrisy in bringing forward constitutional amendments which we believe are unsupportable and which are certainly being presented in a quite dishonest way to the people of Australia.What has been demonstrated over the last few days-the demonstration commenced with the statements which were put out by Senator Amanda Vanstone last Friday on her return to South Australia-is that these proposals are being brought forward not only in a dishonest way but also in a way which is utterly incompetent because, as the Government has now admitted, the proposals would effectively strike down the Hawke Governments own proposals for self-government in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). In other words, the capacity of this Government to put forward something which supposedly is to relate to one vote one value and fair elections throughout the Commonwealth of Australia is exposed as being defective because not only is it not being applied to this Federal Parliament-and, I repeat, nor should it be applied-but also it is incapable of being applied without destroying the whole process of self-government for the ACT which this Government put forward just a few weeks ago. That matter shows, yet again, that this Government has not adequately prepared either itself or the electorate for the changes which are put forward.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

39,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHANEY","EF4","(Western Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",3079,"—Senator Stone says that this is a rush to constitutional change. I certainly agree with his interjection. I shall explain why the Government has fallen on its face. What we have in the proposal for fair elections, the so-called fair elections referendum, is that for electoral regions where there is only one electorate the method of choosing members shall be, as nearly as practicable, the same as the method of choosing senators.I think that everybody in this place is familiar with the method that is used to choose senators. There is a single electorate for the whole State, compulsory voting, preferential voting, a provision for list voting and an exhaustive use of all the ballots which are cast. They are the methods which have been laid down by this Parliament and, I might say, the methods which have been laid down by this Government. It introduced amendments to the method of elections of senators in the previous Parliament. It introduced the list system of voting. Quite clearly, this Government is saying that for a single electoral region, be it a State or a Territory, in which there is to be a vote for a legislative chamber, the method of election shall be as nearly as practicable the same as the method of choosing senators.The Government is proposing a quite different method of electing people to the proposed House of Assembly or the legislative body which is proposed for the Australian Capital Territory. What is proposed for the Australian Capital Territory is essentially a single vote. A single electorate will cast its vote. This provision in the Constitution, if passed, would apply. All that is proposed is that each voter should have the capacity to cast a single vote. It will be quite different from the method of election which is used for the Senate. As the Government conceded at the eleventh hour-indeed, at 12.30 today-to the Opposition, the Bill is defective and it is necessary to introduce amendments to it to make this change.It is not only the proposals for the Australian Capital Territory which are put at risk by this proposed constitutional amendment. The reality is that in at least two of the States there are upper Houses which are elected by methods which would not comply with the Bill which has been introduced into this Parliament. It is interesting that in each case the method of election which was struck down by the proposed constitutional amendment is a method of election that was put in place by Labor governments. In other words, these electoral proposals do not offend against the so-called sacred principle of one vote one value but nonetheless will be struck down by the Bill which is in the form which is at present before the Senate.What is the situation in South Australia and in New South Wales? In New South Wales there is an optional preference system. The Wran Government introduced that system. It reconstituted the Legislative Council of New South Wales, presumably to make it more democratic, more in accord with the principles which are espoused by the Labor Party. That would, no doubt, be its claim. Yet the optional preferential system which is part of the law of New South Wales would be incompatible with the changes being put forward by this Government and the New South Wales Legislative Council elections would, therefore, be struck down.In South Australia there is no list system. In South Australia, as in New South Wales, the method of choosing members of the upper House is not nearly as practicable the same as the method of choosing senators. This Government is rushing through this Parliament proposals for constitutional amendment which would strike down two of the upper Houses in Australia and destroy the proposals for self-government in the Australian Capital Territory. The Opposition says quite simply that this is adding the charge of incompetence to the charge of dishonesty, which we have formally laid. This view of Senator Vanstone, which was put forward last week and on the basis on which the Government has indicated that it now believes it has to amend its proposals, is supported by a memorandum of advice which was obtained from independent counsel. Mr C. K. Comans, QC, consultant draftsman to the Senate, has provided an opinion which makes it clear that the proposals for the Australia Capital Territory would be destroyed by the present Bill.In these circumstances we believe that the Government deserves severe censure. The point has already been made in this debate that the differentials in the electoral systems which are being struck down by this one vote one value proposal, whether one looks at the Western Australian Upper House, which has been the subject of adverse comment or at the upper House of Tasmania which has also been subject to adverse comment, are less than the differentials which apply to the Federal Parliament which is unaffected by the constitutional change. In other words, the weighting of votes which will continue to apply in the Senate is greater than the weighting of votes which is being struck down in the State legislatures, to which this constitutional amendment would quite differentially apply. It applies only to the States; it does not apply to this, the Commonwealth Parliament.We are being treated to a most shabby exercise by this Government. The people of Australia will be left in the most obvious confusion because the Government is unable even to bring forward these proposals without amendment. We understand that other amendments will be brought forward to this Bill by the Australian Democrats with respect to the permitting of proportional representation. I do not know whether the Government will accept those amendments. We have amendments, which I trust the Government will, in some attempt to show its honesty of purpose, accept, to the long title of the Bills. Clearly, the position is one of confusion. Clearly, the position is one of incompetence. We believe that it calls for the censure of this Government. We ask the Australian Democrats to support this motion.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

45,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3080,"—Mr President, there is no point of order. The crooked electoral laws, the malapportionment in this country, have nearly always been as a result of conservative action. Senator Chaney should look at the rorted boundaries in his own State of Western Australia. He and the rest of the Liberals did absolutely nothing about that. Five electoral reform Bills have gone to the Legislative Council in the last six years, and the Liberals have jibbed it; they have done absolutely nothing about that malapportionment in Western Australia. Senator Chaney had the numbers to do something about it. One can only draw two conclusions: he uses one set of words here and goes home and uses another set, or he is a totally ineffectual wimp in Western Australia who cannot influence the Liberal Party in Western Australia or the National Party in Queensland to amend its electoral laws.This set of constitutional provisions is complex. One of the complexities is this: it would be very simple to introduce laws against malapportionment and single member electorates, but unless one blocks, somewhere in the legislation, a movement to a rorted proportional representation system, any such laws are useless. I do not want to go into too much detail. I can see Senator Boswell thinking, `How can we rort the new scheme if this referendum gets in?. I can hear Senator Boswell thinking that from here. The reality is: proportional representation is not necessarily a fair system. There can be malapportionment under proportional representation. I cite two overseas systems. The Japanese system does not have proportional representation but has multi-member electorates. There are not the same number of members in each electorate. So there can be not only malapportionment but also a restricted number of members in some electorates, say five in one and eight in another, even though they are the same size. The Irish system is one of the most malapportioned systems in the world and has proportional representation.We, as a government, would be justified in putting in the Bill those provisions that relate to the referendum to outlaw a particular malapportionment proportional representation system. If the technical drafting of that legislation knocked out genuine systems, I do not think it would be desirable for this Government or this Parliament for that position to be sustained. If that is the position, if by trying to outlaw malapportionment through a potential proportional representation system as a device to be adopted by State governments, we rule out legitimate existing systems, of course we have to amend the legislation before it is put to the people of Australia.When we look at the history of electoral reform in Australia we find that the last recorded instance of the Labor Party badly interfering with electoral boundaries, to its own shame, was in 1949. That was 38 years ago. When we look to the last time the conservatives, the Liberal and National parties, sought to sustain unfair boundaries, we only have to look to last year in Western Australia. When we look to the situation in Queensland we find that at long last, and I never hear a comment from those opposite, the Queensland Liberal Party has come out and opposed the unfair electoral boundaries in Queensland-unfair to the extent that it will campaign against the national Liberal Party. I do not have much sympathy, though, for the Queensland Liberal Party. On many occasions in the 1970s and early 1980s it was offered an opportunity to do away with those boundaries. It was more interested in staying in office, more interested in providing Ministers in the Queensland coalition Government, and more interested in the trappings of power than it was in its own long term self-interest. Since 1983 it has had to pay a mighty price. It was decimated back to six seats at one particular election. It has had to put up with two of its key members, Mr Lane and Mr Austin, being endorsed by the Liberal Party, being elected by the Liberal Party, and then ratting on the Liberal Party in Queensland, all because those two members wanted to become Ministers.We have also heard, once again, the ludicrous charge from Senator Chaney, admittedly only as a throwaway line, that this set of referendum proposals, especially the first one, will weaken the Senate, will destroy Senate power. I had to point out in my speech at the second reading stage that Senator Chaney sits there now as someone who sat on this side of the chamber in 1977 and vigorously supported simultaneous elections. It is the simultaneous election provision that he objects to.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

He said:If we are all to be men of absolute consistency it seems to me that we will never make progress with constitutional change and reform.Never before has such a prophetic thing been said, because one could never accuse Senator Chaney of consistency. But in terms of supporting the 1977 referendum, sponsored by his hero Mr Malcolm Fraser, what did Senator Chaney have to say about that referendum weakening the powers of the Senate? He said:There is no real dispute in this chamber about the fact that we should have fewer elections in Australia. It is common knowledge that Senate elections such as have been held since the early 1960s in Australia are held in a by-election atmosphere, and in that situation they do not genuinely reflect the wish of the people as to who should govern.Then we come to the clinching paragraph:Why is it that suddenly the concept of bringing the elections together will destroy this chamber? I do not believe that it will.`I do not believe that it will, said Senator Chaney in 1977. Now that he is in opposition, for the most opportunistic reasons the Opposition opposes the referendum proposals.In 1974 the Liberal-National Opposition was opposed to simultaneous elections. But in 1977, when the Liberal and National parties were in power with a record majority, they suddenly found, for their own convenience, that simultaneous elections were a very good thing. Now that they are in opposition again, simultaneous elections are no longer acceptable. These are the typical flip-flop policies of the Liberal-National Party coalition.

Now that I have been interrupted I will have to return to my train of thought; that is, that the referendum proposals are being opposed by those opposite essentially because of the need for internal unity. That leads us-and this is why I may have been circumnavigating the globe-to the point of the motion before us and to the main points in the Oppositions debate this week. Because those opposite have not addressed this matter as a question of principle, because they have not addressed the central issues, the very early tactic adopted was, `We have to go to the fringe issues. We cannot take them head on. Let us look at all the fringe issues, all the red herrings, all the irrelevancies that can be introduced to distract debate on this issue. We knew that was coming before last Monday. We have had a whole series of speeches. It is very edifying to go back and read the speeches made in the second reading debate because they have more in common for what is disparate in them than for what is common to them. All these red herrings were raised.When the question was raised this morning as to whether the legislation should be amended, I thought: Here is another big red herring that the Liberal Party and the National Party will run on. Here is manna from heaven to fill their empty views on the proposals for the referendum. As for the guts of the motion-whether the Government should be censured because it is seeking to amend its legislation-time and time again the Government comes into this chamber or the other place and amends legislation. We would have been open to censure if we had taken the easy path and just ignored the problem. We have had to show the courage, knowing what the reaction would be today, to say that we believe that the second referendum Bill should be amended to make it better. I will conclude on the following note, provided I am not provoked.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[3]/talk.start[9]/para","N/A","N/A"

64,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3080,"—I have been provoked. In typical conservative style, I will do up the button on my coat and go for another 10 minutes. These technical details we are dealing with, for the edification of anyone who is listening, are that when the Government sought to outlaw malapportionment in the States, it was necessary not just to outlaw the 10 per cent deviation over average enrolment in single member constituencies. It would have been quite open to a devious, cunning government somewhere up north to divide its State into several zones and then to apply a rorted form of proportional representation. Therefore, in the original legislation there was a general catch-all clause dealing with proportional representation.It may appear, on legal interpretation, that that would interfere with existing valid proportional representation systems. Therefore, provisions were put in the initial referendum Bills to cover those contingencies. They have been found to be less than perfect. The Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) is seeking to amend them. I do not believe that that is a matter for censure. It is another excuse for the Opposition not to confront the basic issues but to run with the red herrings. We are accused, in extravagant language, of being dishonest. The reality is that the Opposition has never been honest on these referendum proposals. It has never addressed them on their merits but on the basis of political expediency and a desire to present a united front. Once again the conservatives of this country are endorsing and underwriting rorted electoral laws right around the country.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[3]/talk.start[10]/para","N/A","N/A"

I am waiting for the big speech in Western Australia where there are electorates in which the number of voters varies from about 3,000 up to 28,000. Did Senator Chaney have laryngitis? Why did he not once speak out? He is a man of principle and a man of courage. Why did he not once speak out against these things? When he does, maybe I, on this side, will then start to accept some of his sanctimonious charges about dishonesty. But when it comes to inconsistency and lack of courage for speaking out, Senator Chaney must take the cake. Being the most prominent Liberal in Western Australia he let that crooked system go by year by year and said nothing. He let his crooked colleagues in Western Australia run loose with the electoral boundaries. Where there are up to 8:1 differences in the ratios between electorates, Senator Chaney, the man of principle, is absolutely silent. I am really tempted to move an amendment to this censure motion to censure Senator Chaney for his absolute gutlessness in dealing with malapportionment in Western Australia.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[3]/talk.start[12]/para","N/A","N/A"
69,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3084,"—Senator Robert Ray has said that he has come into this chamber to give us a circumnavigation of the issue. He certainly has, because, like Christopher Columbus, he started off not knowing where the hell he was going and when he got there he did not have the faintest idea where the hell he was; and he has been doing it all on money bludged off rich mates of the Australian Labor Party around Australia.This whole debate turns on the question of what the Australian Labor Partys attitude is to the Australian Constitution-not a document which should be sought to be amended carefully after proper debate and proper scrutiny, but simply a tool for the Australian Labor Party to put into effect those sorts of things which it has been unable to achieve in terms of the States of Australia or, indeed, to persuade the electors in other circumstances to put into the Constitution either at the State or at the Commonwealth level.This motion of censure arises because the Government, after all its posturing and all its noise about the importance of constitutional reform, has sought to bring forward a piece of legislation found on its own tests to be defective. What does it propose to do? It proposes to introduce further amendments to its own amendment essentially to preserve the rorts and gerrymanders in the electoral law which State Labor administrations have put into effect or are intending to put into effect. It is amending this piece of legislation in order to preserve a system of election in the upper House in New South Wales introduced by Mr Wran-whose conviction about the one vote one value arrangement was such as to draw electoral boundaries to ensure that the Opposition parties needed more than 52 per cent of the vote in order to win government-in order to advantage the Labor Party in the State upper House. The legislation seeks to bring into the Australian Capital Territory a method of election devised by some boy wonder down the other end of this chamber in order to preserve the position of the Labor Party as far as the Australian Capital Territory was concerned. And it is to make sure that when Mr Hand introduces his proposals for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and has an electoral system which has 52 regional electorates, none of which has one vote one value, or acceptable electoral systems, according to this piece of legislation, those proposals shall be preserved.So we have an amendment to the Governments own attempt to amend the Constitution based upon the necessity to preserve an existing Labor Party rort in New South Wales, to create a Labor Party rort in the Australian Capital Territory and to develop a Labor Party rort as far as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is concerned.This matter is now being pushed through with maximum speed not because there is any necessity to do so but in order to get these honourable senators opposite down to their watering hole in Tasmania where they can take clubs to each other in the course of their National Conference, hosted by a Party branch whose investments have got them into financial strife in Tasmania. They cannot even invest their own money wisely, let alone be trusted with the government of the country.They are going down to their conference in Tasmania so that Senator Button can decide whether or not their uranium policy is in fact a silly policy. Senator Evans can formally apologise to the Australian Council of Trade Unions for having flirted with privatisation. Senator Tate can make all sorts of explanations about why he, as the Minister representing the Attorney-General, cannot run a pie shop let alone demonstrate any capacity here. He is a person who cannot answer questions about Federal Hotels Ltd or about the National Crime Authority, and who does not even understand his own War Crimes Amendment Bill. He does not know what sort of advice he has been getting from the Attorney-Generals Department or from the Australian Electoral Commission about a piece of legislation for which he is now responsible.The National Conference will enable Senator Richardson to confront his Tasmanian friends about whether he proposes to dishonour the clear promise given by Mr Cohen to adopt the findings of the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests. It will allow him to explain that. It will allow Senator Bolkus to explain all of this nonsense about cheaper clothing, textile and footwear imports when they are not actually affected by the proposed tariff reductions. It will allow Senator Button and Senator Cook to sort out who it is that will have the last say on uranium policy.That is the imperative that we have been faced with in terms of the time which has been made available for this debate. Senator Ray talks about this being some sort of anarchistic approach. I have no doubt that, given the Labor Partys approach to the Senate, and given its attitude to the Parliament, what it would really like to do is go out and find some van der Lubbe in the community to set fire to the Reichstag, to burn the whole place down so it can govern without it. One only wonders what Tommy Domican is doing next weekend. There will undoubtedly be plenty of opportunity for the Labor Party to adopt that tactic.What we have seen here is quite clearly an attempt by the Government to bring forward amendments to the Australian Constitution which on the face of them appear to be absolutely shoddy amendments which need to be changed. It was to the great credit of Senator Vanstone that, in discharging her responsibility concerning the electoral system in the Australian Capital Territory, she perceived the difficulty involved in the Constitution Alteration (Fair Elections) Bill and discovered that there was a legal opinion provided by an eminent Queens Counsel who has served in many advisory capacities for both the Senate and the Government which made it quite clear that the Government did not have the faintest understanding of the import of its own piece of legislation-a piece of legislation that had presumably been through the Cabinet, through Cabinet committees; through the Attorney-Generals Department three times and has now been found to be incompetent; through the Caucus and its committees; and steamrolled through the House of Representatives and found to be shoddy.Had it not been for the ability of the Senate to deal with this matter in good order we would have had an attempt to put into the Australian Constitution a flawed piece of legislation, a whole new chapter in the Constitution which was suddenly found not to have suited the political desires of the Australian Labor Party. Its whole attitude to this matter is like its attitude to the Australia Card. We can have lots of legislation but every now and again the really important, significant parts of the legislation simply do not work. They will not work in this case because the ministry involved is not competent enough to draw up legislation to have the required effects. The Attorney-Generals Department above all, for which Senator Tate is responsible in this place, has created a running saga of pieces of legislation fundamentally defective which the Government has had to withdraw from the Parliament or try to make explanations for. Senator Tate still cannot explain the import of the war crimes legislation he is bringing forward. I have no doubt that he will be totally incompetent in terms of being able to explain all of the national companies and securities legislation which is coming forward.The debate on the first clause of the referendum Bill, which we debated the other day and about which Senator Robert Ray has made so much, went for so long because Senator Tate was unable to give any satisfactory answers in that debate. This is typical of the way in which the Government approaches its legislative responsibilities in this place and, indeed, the way in which it approaches the whole question of constitutional reform. If it had not been for the ability of the Senate to deal with this piece of legislation, legislation would have been enacted, on the basis of the numbers which the Government together with the Australian Democrats has in this place, which would have been flawed. If it had not been for this chamber, with the Democrats supporting the Opposition parties on this question, we would have had the Australia Card rammed through, with all its unintended consequences.If it had not been for this chamber we would have had the Bill of Rights rammed down the neck of the people of Australia. We are now seeing an attempt, in the fourth referendum question, to introduce that by back door methods anyway. Therefore, it is no wonder that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Gareth Evans) is pursuing the policy so clearly enunciated in his maiden speech in this place about white-anting the Senate, about making sure that every conceivable opportunity is taken to weaken the power of the Senate, to change its terms, to change its rotation and to change its constitutional powers. The one thing that one can say about Senator Gareth Evans is that he has been absolutely consistent in his belief-undoubtedly being reinforced at this very moment-that the Senate should be closed down as quickly as possible and all power transferred in the first instance to the Caucus and in the second instance, through the Caucus, to the Executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) so that it can run the country in the way that it ran and ruined Bourkes department store in Melbourne.Senator Robert Ray made all sorts of comments about the situation in terms of Western Australia. What he is not prepared to do is address the question of the resignation of Mr Tonkin, the Minister responsible for electoral affairs in Western Australia, who quit his position because he knew that the Labor Party in Western Australia was not playing honest with the people of that State on electoral reform. As I have said, the reason that this legislation was pressurised through the House of Representatives has a great deal to do with the Labor Partys political agenda; it has nothing to do with the good government of Australia and it has nothing to do with proper constitutional practice in Australia. How Senator Tate, trading as he does-I do not blame him for this-upon the personal goodwill that exists towards him across the chamber, can continue to come in here and display the level of ministerial incompetence that he displays is almost beyond belief.We have once again gone through this most exhaustive process to produce a constitutional amendment found to be absolutely flawed. The reason that it has been demonstrated to be flawed and the reason that it is to be changed is that the Labor Partys political agenda, in terms of the upper House of New South Wales and the proposed electoral system in the Australian Capital Territory and all the other electoral thimble and pea tricks that it is going on with, would potentially have been caught. It is not that the Labor Party wants fair and democratic elections; it wants constitutional arrangements to guarantee maximum political benefit for the Australian Labor Party. The moment it finds that the effect of its constitutional amendment is to weaken the political position of the Australian Labor Party we are confronted, all of a sudden, at the eleventh hour, with amendments to constitutional legislation.Goodness knows what would have happened if the House of Representatives had adjourned the other day until August and had not been scheduled to be returning on Friday in order to look at the Governments amendments. Presumably, there would have been telegrams dispatched all around the place dragging Labor Party members back from their conference or from their free trips to all sorts of corners of the world to bring back the House of Representatives in order to meet this Governments September deadline-or whatever it is-for this constitutional referendum. That deadline is there only in order to divert public attention from the enormous economic problems created by the policies of this Government, underpinned by the political problems that it has over uranium and other issues which are to come up at its conference. That $35m set aside in the appropriation legislation for the conduct of this unnecessary referendum could properly have been spent on all the other high priority matters in this country at the moment, or indeed should not have been spent in the way in which this profligate approach to public expenditure is being undertaken by the Government.The motion which has been moved by Senator Chaney is a simple one. It condemns and censures the Government for the incompetence which it has displayed in negligently proposing to the people of Australia referendum, proposals the full consequences of which have not yet been considered. It is quite clear that neither Senator Tate nor anybody else on the Labor Party front bench actually understood in detail the referendum proposal on which the Government was proposing to spend $35m to entrench in the Australian Constitution, and they have been caught out once again, as they were on the Australia Card and as they were with the Bill of Rights. The Senate should properly condemn the Government for that incompetence. We now wait for the incompetent Minister in charge of the Bill actually to get into the debate instead of leaving it to Senator Ray to try to cover for him in this matter.This motion of censure ought to be passed because the Government stands condemned for the manifest incompetence which will be demonstrated when it seeks to amend its own amendments to the Constitution, which ought to be regarded as the fundamental organic law of this country and held in proper respect, not as the mere plaything for the Australian Labor Party and its various tawdry factions.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have not heard from either Senator Chaney or Senator Puplick as to whether the Opposition parties intend to oppose or support the amendments, but if the Opposition was of a mind, as I gained from Senator Puplicks comments-although I may have been wrong-to oppose the amendments, and if we did likewise, those amendments would be lost. What would happen then, of course, is that we would not have a proposal that is flawed, because the Opposition would have decided it was not flawed when it opposed the amendments.

Is Senator Chaney arguing and putting us on notice that the next Liberal government, when it finds that it has made a mistake in any of its legislation, will not seek to amend it in this chamber? I find that proposition too much to swallow.I remind honourable senators of the famous story of Maynard Keynes when a woman in the audience said to him, `What you are saying now is inconsistent with what you said when you lectured us last year, to which he replied, `Madam, when I find I am wrong, I change my mind. What do you do?. The Senate has yet to determine whether it thinks the Government is wrong. We will have to wait until the committee stage to see whether it does. Senator Walters, who has been interjecting volubly on my right, would have noticed that last week I foreshadowed an amendment to the Bill. I hope that when we reach the appropriate stage we will debate it. I was not about to move a censure motion on the Government because I wanted to move an amendment to a Bill. If I was going to do that, I would be launching a censure every day of the week. If honourable senators read the Hansards they will find that the Democrats produce amendment after amendment. We believe that this chamber has the right and the duty to consider legislation in detail and to amend it where necessary.

It was the subject of a joint committee inquiry for 2 1/2 years. The Bill was probably considered in more detail than any other Bill. I certainly have not rushed any amendments. As I said in my speech to the second reading motion of this Bill, I would have preferred the Government to have taken up my private members Bill, which was exhaustively inquired into. The Government may now wish that it had taken it up, because this section did not appear in it. I imagine that it arose, if one considered the possible origin of its drafting, from the last section in my Bill, which dealt with penalties for a State that did not abide by the requirement to have fair elections and, having come up against that constitutional barrier, where the High Court had declared that an election could be held under the existing boundaries. In my Bill the penalty under those circumstances was that the election would have to be held at large, the method being as near as practicable to the same as the method for electing the senators.In what might be an attempt at elegance of drafting, it is proposed that that section be incorporated into the body of the Constitution to deal with both the territories and States. Unfortunately, it is said at that point to run foul of two considerations. In the upper House in New South Wales, presumably, the method used is not the same as the method of choosing senators. The method used is the optional preferential system, the dHondt system. In its use of a mathematical calculation it differs quite significantly from the modified Hare-Clark system used in the Senate. I will be asking a number of questions in the committee stage to try to elicit from the Government whether that is true before we commit ourselves to supporting the amendments which have been circulated by the Government.

So the Opposition is in difficulty if it proposes to vote against the amendments simply on those grounds. I am spelling out whether we support what we were shown this morning by the Government. I am not sure whether the section runs foul of that consideration.

My Party has already expressed the view that we would not support the dHondt system in the Australian Capital Territory. We have always opposed an optional preferential system in the upper House in New South Wales. In fact, our sole representative in the upper House at the time it was debated voted against it. I believe that Mr Greiner proposes to change that proposition. For those who have not caught up with it, I flag that our current two representatives in the upper House in New South Wales, who hold the balance of power, have determined that they would get rid of the optional preferential method. On both of those grounds, I am not sure why it would be expected that we would want to support the proposition being advanced here. At this stage I signal that we would argue that the Bill is not flawed as it stands, that section 124b (2) (b) is not flawed, because at the moment we do not propose to support the amendments.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[5]/talk.start[10]/para","N/A","N/A"

That does not worry me. We voted against it in the upper House in New South Wales. We will vote to change that. I understand that Mr Greiner is seeking to do that, so it does not worry me that that method will disappear. But I signal, in terms of Senator Chaneys interjection, that at the moment I am not sure because the opinion we were given differs from the opinion the Opposition was given. I believe that the Government ought to be able to bring forward more detailed arguments than it was able to bring forward to me in the short time that I had this morning talking to officers from the Attorney-Generals Department. I did not accept the points they made to me at the time. I said that I would have to consider them, and I intend to consider them. On that basis, firstly, I believe that this is inappropriate and, at best, should have been brought forward after we had had a chance to see whether the propositions were flawed. Secondly, I will never enter into a censure of a government seeking to amend a Bill in this chamber. I believe that it is entirely appropriate that governments amend Bills in this chamber if they believe they are wrong. The last thing I will do is lend my vote to a proposition that the Government should pass through this chamber a Bill it believes to be incorrect. That is an utterly absurd proposition. Thirdly, one must hold to the proposition that what the Government proposes is not important-that what is important is what the Parliament proposes to the people. I would hope-and Senator Vanstone has done this in regard to this proposition-that it was the duty of every senator in this place to raise whatever difficulties they believed were in the legislation. In fact, a number of Opposition senators have already signalled their intention to do so with regard to a number of the clauses. That is what this chamber is about when in committee, and the other place is not. That is what makes this chamber worth preserving.It seems patently absurd to go around censuring because we should be carrying out our job or because somehow this chamber will simply be supine in the face of any legislation that this Government introduces or even that the Opposition, when in power, will introduce. This censure motion is shot through with illogicalities on that basis. It cannot be supported, and certainly cannot be supported at this time. If at a later stage the legislation is recast, it may be a totally different matter. But that later stage would certainly have to be after the committee stage of these Bills.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[5]/talk.start[13]/para","N/A","N/A"

I would hate to do anything to dent the veritable welter of goodwill that I have engendered across the chamber in the last five years but, at the risk of doing so, might I say that the craven capitulation of Senator Puplick last week to the Queensland National Party is nothing compared with the complete cowardice shown by John Howard and Senator Chaney when it comes to doing anything to keep up the Queensland alliance. The bottom line for the Liberal Party of today is, `We will do anything to keep the Queensland Nationals in power. We do not care about our own Party. We will do anything to look after the Queensland Nationals. All principle will be forsaken as long as we can keep the Queensland Nationals in power. I would like to engender a few facts into this debate, because they clearly demonstrate that the Government has attempted to make sure that there has been maximum time for debate not only about the constitutional amendment Bills but also about the system of government for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It has acted to make sure that that debate can take place in both the parliamentary sphere and in the community generally.Let us look at the history of the current situation. A possible model of ACT self-government was released by the responsible Minister, Gary Punch, on 13 April. The discussion paper was issued to provide a framework within which the public and interested organisations should give their views on what shape self-government should take before the Government finalised the proposals. Included in that possible model was the European dHondt system. Mr Punch has had very productive discussions with Senator Vanstone on that discussion paper. Because Senator Vanstone sought more information to allow her Party to properly consider the ramifications of the Governments proposal, Gary Punch, the responsible Minister, in the spirit of cooperation, gave her information in the form of drafting instructions. Three weeks after that discussion paper was released the Government introduced into this Parliament a Bill to alter the Constitution as it affects electoral systems not just in the ACT but right around Australia.Obviously, the final self-government model which will be adopted for the ACT must take into account not only the deliberations of the Parliament and the community discussions on the question of constitutional amendment but also the system proposed for the ACT itself. Again, the debate must take into account any other element of the model of ACT self-government. That is what the whole consultation process is about. Whether we are talking about Bills for self-government for the ACT or Bills to amend the Constitution, any senator would be aware that it is possible to amend them. That is what government is about.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Any senator would be well and truly aware that legislation is introduced into the Parliament so that it can be reviewed. I have been a senator for but five years, but I would not know how many times in those five years I have seen the Government either introduce amendments to legislation of all kinds or accept them from the Opposition, from the Australian Democrats or from Independents. That is what government is about. This is a chamber of review. Far from being censured for the process that I have just outlined, the Government should be congratulated. No government should ever adopt the pose that it can get nothing wrong, that everything it does is perfect and that it should amend nothing. That is not what this Government has ever been about.Senator Chaney began this tedious bit of nonsense today with the great statement that the referendum proposals amount to nothing more than an attack on the powers of the Senate! The National Party has said that the proposals are supposed to gut the independence of the Senate-that they are a direct threat to the ability of the Senate to properly monitor legislation. We have been told that they are a major assault on the role and influence of the less populous States. All of this is camouflage for the real reason, which, as I said, is to do anything to protect the Queensland Nationals. Name one power of the Senate that is affected by the referendum proposals, if carried. Where is it suggested that the power of the Senate to amend or to examine any Bill is even touched upon? Nowhere in the legislation does that happen; nowhere could it happen. Can the Senate still block Supply? Of course it can still block Supply. The reality is that nothing changes except that all senators would come out with the House of Representatives. We are told that that is a really big deal. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) says-and, according to Senator Walters, he would not tell a lie-Senator Walters and others are saying, `All you have to do to get our support on this is to do a quick flip.

Senator Puplick made reference to Labor Party senators trying to get trips. All of my poor forlorn colleagues whom I saw lined up on the platform trying to get onto that gravy train found out that the carriages were full. They were full because members of the Opposition were all in them. It was the Opposition that decided a long time ago to get out of here as early as it could and head for the hills. And what lovely far away hills members of the Opposition are heading for. Every garden spot on the globe will have some of them in it. This is what will be happening while we, of course, are at work in Hobart serving the people.I also want to refer to some remarks of Senator Puplick. We should never forget the honourable senator in these debates. He said that self-government is all about a Labor Party rort for the ACT. I thought we were in this position because the Liberal Party supported the Government in introducing the dHondt system. Senator Puplick and his colleagues all agree. If it is a Labor Party rort, it must have been pretty okay for the Liberal Party as well. The reality is that it had nought to do with rorts and everything to do with achieving a system we can all agree on for self-government in the ACT. Both sides have always mouthed the platitudes about introducing for self-government in the ACT. But when it came down to the nitty-gritty, they could not agree. Finally, when we get a Minister like Gary Punch who can come up with a proposal that all sides can agree with, we then get Senator Puplick standing up and saying that it is a Labor Party rort.I might say that at least we all get to talk to each other at our conferences. We will all be able to talk to each other at Hobart next week. Senator Puplick is just a nose pressed up against the windowpane at the Liberal Partys national conference. Not that it would matter if he were inside, because there is no such thing, of course, as that conference having any power. Mind you, looking at the decisions it has made, thank God it does not have a lot of power. The only thing that we saw achieved at the Liberal Party national conference was the fourth reconciliation between John Howard and John Elliott. I think it lasted two days, which made it a little longer than the previous three.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[6]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

He has taken it to new heights or, should I say, new depths. Nowhere can anyone remember in this Parliament anyone walking away from his promises on the environment as Senator Puplick has done.Not only that, but you will recall, Mr President, what I said last week when we were looking at the whole debate on World Heritage.

Senator Chaney addressed much of his contribution to the question of one vote one value. In saying that I believe that the whole Liberal Party tactic in the motion before the Senate today and in the referendum Bills is about maintaining a deal with the Queensland Nationals which amounts to lying down before them, I want to quote one John Howard, not from a speech of a long time ago but from a Brisbane radio interview this morning. He said:I dont have any disagreement with the Queensland Liberal Party about the electoral re-distribution in Queensland. It is loaded against the Liberal Party, it is unfair. I am against the zoning system . . . but my disagreement with my colleagues is not about that but about the way to get rid of it. I believe it should only be got rid of in the Queensland Parliament-where, of course, the Queensland Nationals have the numbers and will not get rid of it. That is the depth of the commitment of the Liberal Party of Australia to fair elections. What it is about here today is to do anything whatsoever to disrupt debate and to delay. Who in Australia who has listened to Parliament in the last week could doubt that the Constitution amendment Bills have been debated ad nauseam. Speaker after speaker has been up in this place taking up, as is his right, the time of this Senate on this question. No Bills will ever have been debated like these Bills. Yet, it is claimed that the Government is rushing them through. The reality is that the Senate will take all the time that it needs. The Government does not have the numbers to force the legislation through. All honourable senators will get their go. Mind you, most of them have had several already. At the end of the day, that is what democracy is about. We have to make sure that senators can debate the legislation.We are not so proud as to say that we can never get anything wrong. Unlike Senator Chaney and the Liberal Party, if it were shown that in Queensland the legislation could be got around by making divisions and weighting voters differently, why would we not introduce an amendment? We are determined that in Queensland and in the whole of Australia voters will get equal rights. We are determined that there will be one vote one value across the country and fair elections. Fair elections is what the Labor Party is about; it is what the Liberal Party cannot stomach because it cannot do anything but agree with the Queensland Nationals. Looking at the record of the Queensland Nationals, it is pathetic to think that they set the standard for the Liberal Party of the 1980s and the 1990s.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[6]/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

I rarely support censure motions in so far as governments are concerned. But I support the motion which is now before the Senate. Not only has the Government shown that it is incompetent because if was prepared to put this referendum question forward as a proposition, ram it through the House of Representatives, bring it before the Senate and put it to the people in a defective form, but also the other proposals, the full ramifications of which have not been considered, are defective.The debate thus far has centred on the second proposal. But what about the first proposal? Let me remind the Senate what the Attorney-General of Australia, Mr Lionel Bowen, said on A.M. on 11 May 1988. He said that the first proposal was about the question of the Senates power to block Supply. Let me read what I asked Senator Tate during the debate on Thursday last. I asked:Am I to understand that the principal reason advanced by the Government for this measure-that is to say, the first proposal-is that it would do something to solve the problems of the Senate blocking Supply?Senator Tate replied:No, this proposal does not attempt to address that problem.Further on, he said:We do not attempt to address the question of Supply at all.Let me quote what the Attorney-General said of that proposal. He said:But, in other words, what weve got to face up to is the Senates ability to force the House of Representatives election by refusing Supply.Who is deceiving? Who is attempting to mislead? Is Senator Tate attempting to mislead the Parliament, or is the Attorney-General of this country attempting to mislead the people? Or are we to conclude that the Attorney-General of this country-and I am not given to harsh descriptions-is merely a dill? Is his Department serving him and the country well? Quite obviously it is not. He and his Department are not able to get their act together on these referenda or in a number of other areas that the Senate has dealt with. I give two examples. The Senate Select Committee on Video Material asked for a moratorium on X-rated videos while the Joint Committee was considering the matter. What did Lionel Bowen do? He ignored it. On whose advice did he do that? On the advice of his Department. He did not even know what the material contained or the harmful effects it has and has been shown to have, as a result of the evidence brought before the Joint Committee.What did the Senate have to do to the annual report of the Attorney-Generals Department? We had to move a motion saying that the description of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill was incorrect. That is an almost unprecedented act of the Senate, but we had to move-and it was adopted by the Senate-a motion that said that the annual report of the Attorney-Generals Department was faulty and attempted to mislead this Parliament as to the nature of that Senate Select Committees report.Let me go to the fourth question, concerning freedom of religion. Honourable senators will remember that last Tuesday I addressed the Senate about the question of freedom of religion. I listened carefully to Senator Tates response and not one of the points I raised in this chamber was addressed by him. I suspect he knows that I have been accurate in my concerns. That proposal for freedom of religion in fact is an attempt to establish an impenetrable wall which will separate and isolate religious adherents. Why do I say that? If we had a High Court Bench of Murphys, as was the intention of the previous Attorney-General, Senator Evans, that is precisely what would have occurred because the fourth proposal is to extend the provisions of section section 116 of the Constitution to make it applicable to the States.Section 116-the so-called freedom of religion section-was relied upon, although these are not the words in the margin of the Constitution. It does not say that at all. The referendum question is: Do you agree to the extension of freedom of religion? That is the question the people of Australia are going to be asked. The attempt is being made in the Bill to extend section 116 to apply to the States. Who relied upon section 116? Do honourable senators remember the Defence of Government Schools (DOGS) case? The sectarians attempted to use section 116 to cut off funds for poor parochial schools, just as has been done in the United States of America. One might ask: What has the United States of America got to to with this? Let me quote what Mr Justice Murphy said in his judgment, which would have cut off the provision of education funding to schools. He said:Section 116 is very similar to, and obviously taken from, the provisions of the United States Constitution, and the prohibition added against laws `for imposing any religious observance.That is what he said-and it is understood that that is what is involved. What is the latest situation in the United States of America? Under the 1985 high court case of Aguilar v. Felton even handicapped children in Catholic parochial schools are not entitled to have a remedial teacher come from the government to teach them. They must be segregated from those schools and put into caravans outside the precincts of the schools, and then they are able to gain the teachers.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[7]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

114,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HARRADINE","6H4","(Tasmania)","IND","N/A",3093,"—That is called the erection of an impenetrable wall which will isolate and discriminate against the adherents of religion. One thing was possible in the DOGS case and that was that section 96 could have applied; that is, that the funds were paid to the States and therefore were beyond the reach of section 116. But now the Government is making sure that that defence is not available to par- ochial schools in this country. I am going to ask Senator Tate-and I have asked him previously-whether he can give a guarantee that what has occurred in the United States as the result of an almost identical provision will not apply in this country.I believe this motion is very appropriate. The Government was prepared to ram the Bill through the House of Representatives and, if it could not get a majority here, to ram it through the Senate; then put it, in a defective form, to the people. This legislation is not just like an ordinary Bill. The Government has defended itself by saying, `We do this all the time. We amend legislation here and there. What is different?. I will tell honourable senators what is different about this legislation. We are dealing not only with a Bill but also with a Constitution. Once these propositions are in, they are set in concrete. None of us will be able to do anything about that, nor will the electors because they cannot recall us for what we have done. Who is then to decide on these matters? It will be the High Court. Who knows whether in future we might get a bench full of Murphys? Even if we do not, let us remember what a great man, a chief judge of Tasmania, said and if anyone knows judges it is their brother or sister judges. On 24 June 1978 at the Thomas More Quincentenary, he said:I do not wish to be misunderstood when I say that I do not think it possible to establish a Court which we could trust with such a solemn judicial task.He was referring to a Bill of Rights of the type we are talking about here concerning freedom of religion. He went on:The interpretation and application by any Court of fundamental laws necessarily expressed in wide general terms leaves an immense area for the exercise of judicial discretion and for sharp differences of opinion between judges . . . Nor can many decisions in this area be based on bare legal reasoning. The personal attributes of the judge will often be stronger factors in moulding his opinion-his social, religious, political, philosophical and cultural backgrounds and beliefs. Complete objectivity is impossible.That is a chief judge speaking. He continued:Judges who are entrusted with the solemn task of judicial review of Acts of Parliament to determine whether they should be declared void as infringing fundamental laws inevitably become legislators; legislators who are beyond the control of the democratic will . . .He concluded-and I will conclude with his words:I would prefer the democratic control of legislation through the political sanction of the ballot box and a strong second Chamber of Parliament to handing over a substantial measure of control of legislation to a judicial tribunal of a few men-eminent in their profession and men of integrity and wisdom though they may be. Judges are but men and are as subject to subtle corruption by the exercise of great power as other men.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[7]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator Tate, the Minister for Justice, who is responsible for the Bills in this House, did not take part in the debate.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[8]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

But Senator Robert Ray and Senator Richardson had no difficulty in coming in here and making a series of arguments which bore no relation at all to the complaint against the Government. After a debate which was full of red herrings and, on the part of Government speakers, allegations that we were raising red herrings, I just wish to analyse the points that Government speakers have put forward. Principally Senator Ray, and in part Senator Richardson, relied upon attempts to suggest that Opposition senators-particularly Senator Walters and I-had taken different stances on constitutional matters from those which we are taking on the current referenda. Senator Walters took a point of order on that and certainly by way of interjection made her position clear. I would like to make the position clear again. Senator Ray was quoting from debates on a quite different referendum which proposed that there should be simultaneous referendums and no interference with the Senate having two terms of the House of Representatives. On the other hand, if we are going to regard that as the way to measure this debate, can I remind the Senate, as indeed my colleague Senator Short did when we last debated these matters on 26 May, that Senator Tate spoke in this place and supported Bills brought into the House by his colleague, Senator Gareth Evans, which supported the Senate getting a maximum fixed term of eight years. In the field of consistency I think that is much more clearly a quite contrary proposition to the one that Senator Tate is now putting forward than the simultaneous elections proposal of 1977.I want in this response to reject thoroughly the suggestion of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) that it has some mortgage on honesty in the matter of electoral redistribution. I want to quote from the document which was submitted to the then Premier of Western Australia, the Hon. Brian Burke, by his Minister who was responsible for electoral affairs, Mr Arthur Tonkin, and who resigned from that Government because of the attitude adopted by the Burke Government in 1986 to electoral reform. This is what a Labor Minister had to say about the Labor State Government in Western Australia. I will quote his letter of resignation:To hear my colleagues say, as they did in Geraldton on Sunday night, that we must make absolutely sure that the bill, which will contain the promises we had made to the people at the election, is defeated was to hear betrayed all that I have tried to stand for as a member of the Australian Labor Party. The fact that I made the promise on the part of the Government makes my own position untenable.I had never thought it possible that I would hear such a betrayal of basic Labor principles from people whom I believed were my comrades in arms. I cannot continue to serve in a Government from which I feel totally alienated.Further, I believe that such an insincere attitude to the question of electoral reform will be communicated to the people. This will have a disastrous effect upon the Government and upon the cause of electoral reform.This is the final quote I wish to give from what is a much longer letter:If our main purpose is to stay in Government and if we are prepared to be corrupted in the pursuit of that imperative, then we much part company.What Mr Tonkin was saying to his fellow Labor Party members in Western Australia was that they were treading a cynical path which had been trodden by previous Labor governments in Western Australia and he regarded that as a matter which rendered it impossible for him to stay as a member of the Government. All of that I raise purely because these matters have been raised in debate by the Government. They have nothing to do with the allegation of incompetence which is the substance of this motion against the Government this afternoon. The fact of the matter is that the Government has introduced, under the guise or under the name of a fair elections Bill, proposals which, as I have said before in debate, do not apply to anything other than the State legislatures. Our charge against the Government initially was that it had been dishonest in bringing this forward in this way because it singled out the State upper and lower Houses for attention that it was not prepared to give to the Senate and to the House of Representatives. It was imposing a set of rules quite inconsistently; that is, applying one set of rules to the States and another to the Commonwealth. Quite apart from the question of the rights of the States to determine their own electoral arrangements-a matter which is seen of fundamental importance by the coalition-the fact is that this Government was being utterly inconsistent in what it was bringing forward.The hypocrisy of the Government is clearly demonstrated by the fact that when Senator Amanda Vanstone produced evidence that the proposals that the Government was imposing upon the States would, in fact, interfere with its own proposals here in the Australian Capital Territory, the Government promptly announced that it would adopt a different attitude to this referendum. In other words, the Government is prepared to except from the requirements of the present legislation and to alter in the present legislation anything which it believes serves its own political advantage and the arrangements which are proposed for the Australian Capital Territory are simply one case in point. We have the very interesting situation where the Government is also, under the existing Bill, putting at risk the New South Wales upper House which has a method of election for upper House members which is not as near as possible to that of the Senate. We have the situation where the Government, because that system suits the ALP in New South Wales and because it does not see that as a difficulty for the Labor Party, is now bringing in amendments which will cover that situation again.I think the premier charge against the Government until these defects were discovered in this legislation was that the Government was hypocritical in its attitude to constitutional reform, that it was seeking to advance its own narrow political interests rather than the national interest. But what has been demonstrated over the last few days since Senator Vanstone disclosed these defects is that the Government has not only been hypocritical; it has been incompetent as well. We take the view that the Government is to be censured because of the importance of the Constitution and because of the sorts of reasons that were put so forcefully by Senator Harradine in the last speech before I rose in my place. The Opposition believes that this motion should be carried and that the Government should not be proceeding with these referenda at this time.Question put:That the motion (Senator Chaneys) be agreed to.","N/A","HAWKE GOVERNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/sso/speech[8]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

That is, utilised to offset the costs incurred by the Government in providing airport and airways facilities and services to the aviation industry. Avgas excise revenues have generally been used to recover the cost of providing en route airways facilities and services. In 1986-87, however, the Government adopted the suggestion of general aviation representative associations that avgas excise be utilised as the main means of recovering all costs from that sector of the aviation industry. A special avgas fuel excise surcharge was therefore introduced from 1 July 1987 to replace the previous fixed annual lump sum charge.Avgas is the fuel used by most general aviation aircraft. Recent joint reviews with industry of general aviation charging arrangements have concluded that avgas excise is an efficient means of collecting revenue from general aviation aircraft without adverse safety consequences. It is currently not possible to replace avgas excise with direct user charges because of the difficulty of recording movements of avgas aircraft.If the CAA is to have access to this efficient and widely supported charging arrangement, it is necessary for the revenue received by the Government from avgas excise and customs tariff duties to be paid to the CAA. The Bill implements this.Not all avgas excise revenue will be paid to the CAA. The fuel excise surcharge introduced from 1 July 1987 was utilised to recover the costs of both airways functions that will transfer to the CAA and some airport functions that will remain the responsibility of the Federal Government. Accordingly the Bill provides that the amount allocable to airport functions (2.393 cents/litre) plus future indexation of this amount be retained by the Government as an attributable revenue.The Bill will have no impact on the level of avgas excise and customs tariff duties payable by avgas aircraft operators. Approximately $22.2m of estimated total receipts in 1988-89 of $24.7m will be paid to the CAA.I commend the Bill.Debate (on motion by Senator Lewis) adjourned.","N/A","AVIATION FUEL REVENUES (SPECIAL APPROPRIATIONS) BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

144,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOLKUS","XE4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Consumer Affairs)",3097,"—I move:That the Bills be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.Leave granted.The speeches read as follows-MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL 1988The Bill contains amendments to the Migration Act 1958 to implement a recent decision to repeal the immigration clearance fee, which was introduced to offset certain costs incurred by or for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in dealing with international air passengers.The Australian immigration clearance fee was introduced into the Migration Act 1958 in 1987. It was modelled on the clearance fee operating in the USA and requires adult passengers on international flights seeking to enter Australia after 1 January 1988 to pay a fee for the services relating to their immigration clearance. The scheme provides for the fee to be collected, and paid to the Commonwealth, by the International airline operator who brought the passengers to Australia, whether or not the airline collected the fee.Most but not all, international airlines operating in the Australian market protested about the immigration clearance fee. Indeed there is currently High Court action to test the validity of the fee and the airlines liabilities under the Act. The Government contends that much, if not all of the claimed shortfall in fees could have been made good by the airlines changing their administrative arrangements towards those used in the USA by many of the same airlines.The Government now proposes however to abolish the current $5 fee. The international air operators will continue to be liable to remit to the Commonwealth the fee payable by all passengers carried to Australia before 30 June 1988.The Bill also will enable the Minister to limit the range of officers of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and officers for the purposes of the Customs Act 1901 who may exercise the powers granted by the Migration Act 1958.As the Migration Act 1958 currently stands, all such officers have very wide-ranging powers, so that, for example, even the most junior officers, irrespective of their duties or responsibilities, could validly issue an entry permit to a person seeking entry to Australia, arrest a person suspected of being a prohibited non-citizen, or search aircraft and ships for stowaways or persons suspected of seeking to enter Australia illegally.It is clearly inappropriate for all officers to have such considerable powers. It is more appropriate that such wide-ranging powers should flow from the administrative necessities and the appropriate responsibilities. To remedy this the Minister is to be given a discretion to exclude an officer or a class of officer, from the exercise of certain powers. This exclusion is to be made in writing.To bring the power to grant an entry permit into line with the power to grant a visa, the Bill amends section 6 of the Migration Act to provide that only an `authorised officer, that is a person authorised by the Minister, can issue an entry permit to a person seeking entry to Australia.The abolition of the immigration clearance fee ($5) from 1 July 1988 should be viewed in the context that the Government has agreed that a $5 share of the new and reduced departure tax of $10 will be notionally allocated towards migration costs incurred in processing international passengers. The revenue from such an allocation is estimated to be $18.45m in 1988-89, which roughly equates to revenue forgone from repealing the immigration clearance fee.I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. This contains details of the amendments I have outlined.I commend this Bill to the Senate.DEPARTURE TAX AMENDMENT BILL 1988The purpose of this Bill is to amend the rate of departure tax contained in the Departure Tax Act 1978 from $20 per passenger to $10 per passenger.The proposed new arrangements taken together with a measure contained in a separate Bill to abolish the $5 immigration clearance fee will be welcomed by travellers, who from 1 July will only have to pay $10 when leaving Australia, rather than $25 as at present.The financial implications of the new departure tax and associated administrative arrangements for its collection are covered in the second reading speech on the Departure Tax Collection Bill, and I propose that the two Bills be debated cognately.I commend this Bill and draw attention to the fact that there is a single explanatory memorandum which covers this Bill and the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1988.DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1988The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Departure Tax Collection Act 1978 to transfer responsibility for the collection of departure tax from international air operators to the Government.Collection by the airlines is no longer appropriate following the Governments decision that departure tax revenue will no longer be part of the overall cost recovery formula for the aviation industry.The proposed new arrangements taken together with measures contained in separate Bills to abolish the $5 immigration clearance fee and to halve the amount of departure tax from $20 to $10 will be welcomed by travellers, who from 1 July will only have to pay $10 in such fees when leaving Australia, rather than $25 as at present.The Bill allows the Minister for Transport and Communications to appoint approved agents to sell departure tax stamps and issue exemption stamps on the Commonwealths behalf. Australia Post currently has a contract with the airlines to collect the tax. As the new tax is to be collected for general revenue purposes, it is appropriate that the Department of Transport and Communications make provision in its budget to take over from the airlines the remaining two years of their current contract with Australia Post and associated costs.Consultations with Australia Post have been undertaken to ensure that the new collection arrangements will be implemented with as little inconvenience to travellers as possible.The principal amendments to the Departure Tax Collection Act are the transferring of responsibility for collection of the tax, contained in clause 4; the repealing of responsibilities of international air operators as set out in clause 5; and the provision within clause 6 for approved agents to be appointed under the regulations to sell and issue tax and exemption stamps to passengers.The Departure Tax Collection Regulations will be amended to incorporate the new arrangements.With regard to the financial impact of the proposed legislation, the estimated collection costs for 1988-89 are $2.5m. This includes the contract cost of Australia Post collecting the tax, as well as additional ongoing administrative costs to the Government arising from the proposal.Revenue from the sale of departure tax stamps at the rate of $10 per passenger is estimated at $36.9m in 1988-89, or $34.4m net after deduction of estimated collection costs.I commend the Bill.Debate (on motion by Senator Lewis) adjourned.","N/A","MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL 1988 DEPARTURE TAX AMENDMENT BILL 1988 DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is in line with the general principle adopted by the Government that such enterprises be subject to taxation on the same basis as private business.The enterprises to become subject to State and Territory pay-roll taxes as a result of this decision are:Australian National RailwaysCivil Aviation AuthorityFederal Airports CorporationAustralia PostTelecom.At present the legislation providing for establishment of the enterprises concerned in each case provides for the enterprises being exempted from State and Territory taxation. The Bill contains amendments to the relevant legislation so that the exemption will not apply to State and Territory pay-roll taxes.The amendments are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. They are to become effective on 1 July 1988.Financial ImpactN/AThe annual pay-roll tax liability of the authorities concerned is estimated at about $220m. In recognition of this increase in revenue to the States, the Commonwealths payments to the States for the year will be reduced. This reduction will not be by the full amount but by approximately 90% of the total amount of pay-roll tax involved. This should amount to just under $200m.Relative to the revenues of the enterprises involved, the additional costs to those enterprises arising from this measure are not great. Claims of enormous increases in charges as a result of this move therefore must be treated as either uninformed or else deliberate exaggerations.I commend the Bill and present the explanatory memorandum.Debate (on motion by Senator Lewis) adjourned.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES LEGISLATION (PAY-ROLL TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the interests of transparency, it is desirable that the costs of collection be identified so that policy can be assessed in the light of their true full costs.Since the levies exist at the request, and for the benefit, of the relevant industries, it is appropriate that the industries not only be aware of but also pay the administration costs. If an industry genuinely requires assistance, this should be provided directly to the area of identified need, in contrast to the imprecise approach of subsidising industry in general for the cost of levy collection.Making industries aware of collection costs, and requiring that they meet these costs, will undoubtedly increase the level of accountability of both the Commonwealth, as the collection agent, and industry, as the beneficiary of this service.In the case of levies which fund the operations of statutory authorities, it is proposed that collection costs be recovered by way of fee payable by those authorities. In the case of research levies, the cost will be recovered from research trust accounts. In the first instance, the payment will be made at the end of the financial year. In future years it is intended to seek quarterly, and in some cases monthly, payments.It is proposed that these cost recovery arrangements take effect from the financial year 1988-89.This measure will produce revenue totalling $1.193m during 1988-89; this figure represents the full year cost of the levy collection.I commend the Bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Lewis) adjourned.","N/A","PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (RECOVERY OF LEVY COLLECTION EXPENSES) BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

By 1 July the increase will be less than the increase in the CPI since the contribution was last adjusted in November 1986.The increase is also less than half the growth in average drug prices over the period.Honourable senators will note that the Government has continued to support those in need by maintaining both free pharmaceutical benefits for all pensioners and the concessional beneficiary rate of $2.50.Furthermore the `safety net scheme continues to provide protection for the chronically ill ensuring that no family need pay for more than 25 prescriptions each calendar year. In 1987, the first full year of the safety net, 500,000 families and single individuals received free pharmaceuticals under the safety net.As announced in the Treasurers May economic statement the increase in the maximum general patient contribution is but one of a number of measures that the Government is taking to restrain the growth in expenditure of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In 1987-88 this expenditure increased by 25% over the previous year.Clearly the Government had to act to rein in this unacceptable rate of increase-a rate of increase that would have seen expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits almost double over the next three years.The steps announced in the May statement will reduce this rate of growth to an estimated 12% in 1988-89, although this will not prevent expenditure exceeding $1 billion next financial year.In addition to the $1 increase in the maximum general patient contribution, the Government is taking steps to reduce prescribing of expensive drugs and to reduce dispensing costs.As these measures do not involve amendments to the National Health Act I shall not discuss them in detail in this debate. Details have been announced in the Treasurers statement and associated documents.I commend the Bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Lewis) adjourned.","N/A","NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This compares with local governments entitlement in 1987-88 of $636.7m.It is necessary to amend the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 because of changes regarding general purpose payments to the States which were agreed at the recent Premiers Conference.Under that Act, general purpose financial assistance for local government, for 1988-89, and subsequent years, was to be determined by changing the amount with respect to the previous year, by the percentage change to Commonwealth general purpose payments to the States.For this purpose, general purpose payments to the States was defined by the Act, under section 6 (5) (a), to include financial assistance grants, identified health grants and general purpose capital assistance payments. Changes to the funding of hospital services agreed to at the recent Premiers Conference has meant the elimination of the category `identified health grants from 1988-89.So that local government is not unintentionally disadvantaged by this change the Government has decided to include in the act an amount in lieu of the existing formula.The amount of $652.5m represents a 2.5% increase over local governments entitlement in 1987-88 of $636.7m. It is a greater increase than would have occurred had the present formula not been amended. This approach would have yielded payments to local government of some $95m less than the proposed payment.The payment will also be some $10m more than if local government funding had been constrained to the increase agreed for the States and Northern Territory at the Premiers Conference.As a result, the increase in payments of 2.5% compares favourably with the increase in comparable payments to the States and the Northern Territory which for the next financial year are anticipated to rise by only 1.1%.Given the Governments continuing need to restrain its own expenditure this Bill provides a fair outcome for local government.It is evidence of the Governments continuing commitment to strengthening local governments place in the Australian system of government and gives effect to the Governments undertaking to treat local government no less favourably than the States in respect of general purpose financial assistance.I commend the Bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Lewis) adjourned.","N/A","LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

174,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOLKUS","XE4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Consumer Affairs)",3101,"—I move:That the Bill be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.Leave granted.The speech read as follows-This Bill puts into effect the termination of the consumption subsidies for phosphatic and nitrogenous fertilisers as from July 1 1988 as announced by the Treasurer in the May economic statement.Over recent years the Government has assisted farmers through the provision of a consumption subsidy on phosphatic and nitrogenous fertilisers manufactured in Australia.A bounty has been paid on domestically produced phosphatic fertilisers for much of the period since 1931, while consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers has been subsidised since 1966. The principal reasons for the continuing payment of the fertiliser bounty/consumption subsidies have included:assisting the rural sector when it was experiencing difficult times; andencouraging productivity gains in the rural sector from the increased application of fertilisers;More recently the subsidies have been compensating the rural sector for the cost impost which the sector suffers as a result of tariff protection for manufacturing industry.However, none of these reasons provides a convincing justification for continuation of the fertiliser subsidies in the present circumstances.The first of these reasons, to assist the rural sector when it was experiencing difficult times, suggests that the fertiliser consumption subsidies might be seen as similar to a rural welfare payment: that is, a payment by the Government to help alleviate falling returns or increasing costs being experienced by farmers.The first point to make in this context is that while the rural sector has undoubtedly experienced some very difficult times during the last few years, the current outlook, particularly for the livestock industries, is more buoyant.The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics has estimated that the cash operating surplus of farms will rise by about 49 per cent in 1987-88, with most of the increase occurring because of higher returns to wool growing. While incomes of specialist grain producers are still low, these farmers are also expected to have rising incomes over the next few years as the outlook for most major rural commodities is for either stable or increasing prices.However, quite apart from whether there is currently a need for the Government to assist the rural sector, there is also an important question as to whether fertiliser subsidies are an efficient way of providing rural assistance. Work undertaken by the former Bureau of Agricultural Economics, reported in 1984, showed that the assistance provided by the fertiliser subsidies was very unevenly distributed. Based on a 1980-81 survey of agricultural and grazing industries, almost 25 per cent of the farms in the survey did not use fertiliser, and so these farms received no assistance. A further 42 per cent received assistance worth less than $300. Only 9 per cent of farms received over $1,000 of assistance. It is thus clear that the payment of this subsidy is simply not an effective welfare measure.I turn now to the second reason which has been used to justify the continuation of the fertiliser subsidies, namely, to assist the rural sector to become more productive.The logic behind this argument is that the consumption subsidies lower the price of fertiliser and that farmers will respond to the lower price by applying more fertiliser, thereby raising agricultural productivity.In its November 1984 submission to the Industries Assistance Commission inquiries into assistance for the consumption and production of fertilisers, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics quoted a number of economic research studies covering a span of 8 years which showed that the demand for fertiliser is relatively price inelastic, but that demand does appear to vary with farm income and liquidity.In other words the demand for fertiliser is unlikely to be influenced to any great extent by the price of fertilisers, but will be influenced by the farms overall financial position.This claim is backed up by the current situation in which rising farm incomes and a favourable seasonal outlook for much of the continent have resulted in fertiliser manufacturers currently experiencing a high level of demand for their products. Assuming that the relationship between price and demand continues to apply, it can be concluded that continued provision of the fertiliser consumption subsidies will not lead to much increase in the purchase of fertilisers.In fact, the lack of sensitivity of fertiliser consumption to the price of fertilisers may be very fortunate for the productivity of Australian agriculture. If the subsidies were more effective they would encourage resources to be allocated to fertiliser application rather than other farm inputs. In doing so they would distort the pattern of resource allocation in Australian agriculture.As an example of the problems which these resource allocation distortions can create, there is increasing evidence that excessive application of fertilisers can lead to reduced gains in productivity arising from problems with soil acidification. Some of Australias most productive agricultural lands are suffering these problems and the farmers concerned have to apply large quantities of lime or other substances to the soil to neutralise it. This is an expensive solution, and to the extent that the fertiliser consumption subsidies encourage the excessive use of fertilisers, the subsidies contribute to this problem.Another example of resource misallocation to which the fertiliser subsidies have contributed is the excessive cropping of marginal lands. In some cases the viability of cropping operations on marginal lands has depended on the application of large quantities of subsidised fertilisers. From the economy-wide perspective, resources used to develop the marginal land could have been more productively used in other applications.Quite apart from the economic misallocation of resources which arise in these circumstances, there are also frequently environmental problems from over-cropping, such as degradation of soil structure and subsequent soil erosion, removal of trees followed by increasing levels of salt in the soil, and so on. Once again, the fertiliser subsidies have contributed to these problems.The third reason which has been used to justify continuation of the fertiliser consumption subsidies is to compensate the rural sector for the impost it suffers as a result of the tariffs protecting Australias manufacturing industries.In the May economic statement the Government has introduced some major changes to its micro-economic policies and, in particular, to the tariff system. The purpose of these changes is to make industries more efficient, by significantly reducing protective tariffs, and exposing the industries to increased competition.The tariff reductions announced in the economic statement will significantly reduce assistance for manufacturing industries, and this will assist farmers both directly and indirectly.Although an estimate of the size of the benefit to the agricultural sector depends on the assumptions used, the increased returns which will result from the reduced assistance to manufacturing are likely to be at least $350 million per annum.This is a most significant gain for the agricultural sector which greatly outweighs the impact of removing the fertiliser subsidies.For the reasons which I have previously referred to, the Government believes that it is now an appropriate time to terminate the fertiliser subsidies. The subsidies are a poor means of providing rural assistance, and invite criticism from the EEC or U.S. that Australian agriculture also benefits from subsidies. The Government has taken the initiative and significantly reduced tariff levels, which will provide important benefits for farmers. In return, the Government believes that it is appropriate for the primary sector to forgo the rather questionable benefits associated with this subsidy.Accordingly, the consumption subsidies on phosphatic and nitrogenous fertilisers will not be available after 30 June 1988. Fertiliser produced and sold for use in Australia as a fertiliser, or used or sold for use in the production of a fertiliser mixture, on or before 30 June 1988 will be eligible for the consumption subsidies. I would stress that to be eligible for the subsidy the fertiliser must be sold or used for the purposes stipulated in the Fertiliser Subsidy Act, by 30 June 1988. Manufacturers will continue to have twelve months from the date on which the end-use condition is satisfied to lodge their claim for the subsidy.Financial Impact StatementN/AWithdrawal of the subsidies is expected to result in savings of $37m in 1988-89 and $13m in 1989-90.I commend the Bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Lewis) adjourned.","N/A","FERTILISERS SUBSIDY AMENDMENT BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

180,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOLKUS","XE4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Consumer Affairs)",3103,"—I move:That the Bill be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.Leave granted.The speech read as follows-The Customs Tariff (Rate Alteration) Bill 1988 which is now before the Senate contains alterations to rates of duty imposed by the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The Bill introduces new customs tariffs resulting from the package of microeconomic reform measures announced this evening.The Bill removes the two per cent revenue duty introduced in July 1979 and implements the first stage of general tariff reductions.In the main, general tariff rates presently in excess of fifteen per cent are to be reduced to fifteen per cent within four years from the first of July 1988. General tariff rates presently in excess of ten per cent but not greater than fifteen per cent are to be reduced to ten per cent within the same period.The annual reductions will be made in percentage point steps or multiples thereof. Roundings to facilitate this will be made on the implementation of the first reduction.Proportional reductions will be made to those duty rates not expressed in ad valorem terms.These changes will not affect tariff arrangements in the passenger motor vehicle industry, where the Government has recently announced substantially reduced protection. Textiles, clothing and footwear industries are also the subject of separate arrangements which the Government has announced tonight. Nor will the changes apply in the chemicals and plastics industries where tariffs are already phasing to fifteen per cent or less. Changes now would recreate anomalies corrected by the Government in its recent decision on assistance for these industries.The decision also will not affect other rates which are currently phasing to fifteen per cent or less. Those rates in the communications industry, which are currently phasing to twenty per cent will now reach fifteen per cent over the four year period.Existing tariff preference arrangements will remain unchanged provided that this does not prevent the general rate reductions to which I have referred.Included in this Bill are the customs tariff changes necessary to meet the Governments initiatives regarding primary product prices announced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy tonight. The Governments intention is that primary product prices subject to Commonwealth administered pricing arrangements should be phased down to international levels. This initiative is aimed at improving efficiency in the industries concerned and should lead to significant reductions in consumer prices for a number of commodities.As a first step, the Government has decided to phase down protection to a number of primary industries in line with general tariff reductions so that tariffs reach a level of fifteen per cent by mid-1992. The industries affected by these changes include sugar, tobacco, dried vine fruits, citrus and wine.At the expiry of the present Commonwealth-State sugar agreement on the thirtieth of June 1989 the embargo on the importation of sugar will be replaced by customs tariffs of twenty-five per cent on refined sugar and thirty-five per cent on raw sugar. These rates will be phased down to fifteen per cent from the first of July 1992. The Commonwealth has decided to end its involvement in administered pricing arrangements for domestic sugar sales.The present non-concessional tariff on tobacco imports will be replaced by an ad valorem tariff of twenty-five per cent phasing down to fifteen per cent from the first of July 1992. The concessional rate of duty provided as a component of the tobacco local content plan will be withdrawn from the first of July 1993.In conjunction with other elements of the microeconomic reform package announced tonight, these changes are a further logical step in the Governments science, industry and technology policy strategy.They will assist the growth of world class industrial activities within Australia by providing a predictable and supportive environment for industry, and by encouraging the development of competitive attitudes and cultures.Financial ImpactN/ARevenue implications are difficult to isolate accurately. However, it is anticipated that the tariff cuts covered by this Bill, tariffs which are already phasing, the changes to the passenger motor vehicle plan and the abolition of the two per cent revenue duty will result in revenue decreases of $460 million in 1988-89 increasing to $900 million in 1992-93.Details of the amendments contained in this Bill have been included in an explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable senators.I commend the Bill.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (RATE ALTERATION) BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

183,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator LEWIS","NG4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",3103,"—My colleague Senator Michael Baume asks whether the Government knows what it is all about. I doubt very much whether Government backbenchers know what it is all about. Coalition senators have had a substantial briefing from officers from the Attorney-Generals Department who tried to explain it to them. I have had great difficulty in grasping the nature of the amendment. Yet the people of Australia will be expected to vote on this proposal which the Government intends to get through before the Senate rises on Thursday evening.In addition, the Senate is also still considering the question of Supply, the Governments money measures. At this stage the coalition parties are not intending to block Supply in order to force an election but are rather hoping that the Government will get its money Bills through before the Senate rises on Thursday evening. The Government has a number of measures which the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, tells us must be put through before Thursday night because the Government will be deprived of revenue if these Bills are not through. We have now been provided with 10 Bills in eight packages. One can see that the coalition parties in opposition have assisted the Government to get through the first readings of those Bills in a few minutes so that the Bills are now listed for debate in the Senate.I draw the Senates attention to these matters in order to point out the impossibility of fulfilling the task which the Government is imposing upon us. It is ridiculous that the Government seems to think that the Senate will be able to debate these matters with the concern and consideration that they need. We have most important referenda proposals, questions of Supply, and committee debates coming up with regard to departmental expenditures, all of which need close and detailed examination. Now this May economic statement legislation has to be debated, and it all has to be put through by Thursday. It is really an impossible situation for the Senate to be in. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.Leave granted; debate adjourned.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (RATE ALTERATION) BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

193,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PARER","KI4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",3104,"—The purpose of my rising is to discuss a particular contract for the new Parliament House. The new Parliament House itself is a magnificent structure, but the management of its construction leaves much to be desired. I would just as soon not be standing here today talking about this, but it has been brought about by the fact that at the Estimates hearings, both on this and previous occasions, we have not received satisfactory replies to the questions asked. In fact, getting information could almost be equated to the drawing of teeth without an anaesthetic.For the information of honourable senators, the granite to curved walls contract involved sawing, detailing and erecting granite panels to form a granite facade on the east and west curved walls of the new Parliament House. In 1983 this contract was awarded to a company called Ferrobeton Pty Ltd, which subsequently changed its name to Granites of Australia Pty Ltd. The first point I want to address is the waste from the colour control rejection. The granite to curved wall contract is mentioned in the Auditor-Generals Efficiency Audit Report on the Parliament House Construction Authority. On page 55 of the report the Auditor-General found that the Authority did not address problems early enough, which led to the rejection of granite slabs because of blemished colour and appearance.Following that report and some publicity given to this matter, I was approached by representatives of the company involved, and my own investigations bore out the Auditor-Generals conclusion. However, a point of great concern was that the quantity wasted was far greater than the Auditor-General thought, as is shown by the Auditor-Generals report. According to the Auditor-General, the revised criteria required an additional 700 square metres of granite to be sawn to replace the rejected slabs. This is absolutely incorrect. When I raised this matter during the last Estimates Committee hearing it was agreed that the figure was maybe in excess of 15,000 square metres. The original contract was for 22,000 square metres, so we now have a rejection of in excess of 7,000 square metres. When I drew this anomaly to the attention of the Acting Auditor-General, he agreed that the figure was not correct, but he also noted in his letter to me that the Authority did not challenge this figure in three successive audit documents or in its published response, hence my remarks earlier that getting proper information from the Construction Authority leaves a lot to be desired.The rejection rate of such large quantities of stone, 7,000 square metres for instance, is equal to one years production for the contractor. It could have been avoided if the contractors warnings that the colour of the stone was changing had been heeded. The contractor alerted the Authority to inconsistencies in the colour of the granites months before colour control was eventually introduced. In fact, seven months before colour control commenced, the contractor had written to the Construction Manager stating that it was:unable to continue any further surface preparation on the granite panels as we are still awaiting a selection criteria to be finalised.This does not tally with the Authoritys version that steps were taken as soon as the problem became apparent.This is but one incident where the Authority failed to take timely action to avoid waste of taxpayers money. For instance, in December 1984 the quarry contractor began supplying Ferrobeton with a new source of granite, called face 6, which proved to have an unacceptably high rejection rate of 35 per cent. The Construction Manager was notified immediately that a new source of granite should be found, but this was not done until early 1986, when face 8 granite was introduced with a 3.8 per cent rejection rate, compared to the previous 35 per cent. The contractor calculated that 1,000 square metres of excessive waste resulted from having to process this face 6 for more than 12 months at a cost of over $110,000, and the Authority agreed during the Estimates meeting that this was one factor which led to need for an additional 7,000 square metres of granite.I was informed by the Authority that it had been considering a new source of granite to replace face 6 in March 1985. However, my information is that no action to develop a new quarry was taken until Tom Skeers, the foreman of the quarry contractor, located and arranged for leasing of a new source of granite in his own name in February-March, 1986. It was Tom Skeerss quarry which the Concrete-Holland Joint Venture spent approximately a quarter of a million dollars developing to supply the face 8 granite which eventually replaced the high rejection rate face 6.Further wastage of granite occurred when the quarry contractor began supplying Ferrobeton with oversized blocks. The dimensions of the blocks being supplied exceeded the quarry schedule size of 2.1 by 1.5 by 1 metre. The construction manager did not make the quarry contractor reduce the size of the blocks despite requests from the contractor, and the information in the monthly progress reports which detailed the amount of oversaw that these oversized blocks were generating. Ferrobeton estimates that some 4,000 square metres of granite was totally wasted as a result of these oversized blocks.The additional quantity of granite used on this contract has blown out, as I said earlier, to more than 15,500 square metres according to the Authority. This is nearly 70 per cent again of the original quantity of granite specified for this contract of 21,000 square metres. The Authority tells me that this is not a problem as the granite rejected from the curved walls would be cut into pavers and used to landscape the courtyards around the building.Because of the shortage of time I will skip some of the remarks that were made in the Estimates Committee meeting and come to a series of questions. During the Estimates Committee meeting, Mr OConnell told me that `all the sawn granite will be used in the landscaping, while Mr Fowler said of the reject granite that `all the granite has been used in the landscaping. Indeed, the Authority will have to do further excavation in order to complete the last part of landscaping, which is the formal gardens. The first point I make about that is that while this is a very convenient way to get rid of the mistakes, it does not excuse the Authority or its representatives for failing to address problems in a timely manner, which could have avoided the generation of so much waste.Secondly, I challenge the Authoritys assertion that all the granite was used in the landscaping. The granite offcuts from this contract were recently disposed of by public tender to Uneena Pty Ltd. The principal of that company, I understand, is Mr Chandler. I do not in any way cast any aspersions on his character, because he did notify the Authority of his interest. I think the mistake was, because of the conflict of interest, that the Authority allowed him to go ahead and put his tender in. That was morally wrong and wrong in principle-not wrong for Mr Chandler but wrong for the Authority. Mr Chandler was reported in the Melbourne Herald as saying that Uneena had been used as a tender vehicle to assist a company called Aussie Offcuts, which wanted the wasted granite to make tourist souvenirs-all that wasted granite for tourist souvenirs! I have with me an advertisement from last Saturday weeks Canberra Times placed by Aussie Offcuts, this same company, which reads: `For Sale, Granite offcuts and slabs (some polished) at bargain prices!. The advert goes on to say that it is suitable for paving, coffee tables, barbecue tables, garden seats, kitchen bench inserts, mantelpieces, et cetera-`Have your own piece of genuine Parliament House granite. Visit our site and select your own. Mr OConnell described the granite that was disposed of by public tender as `off-cuts-small pieces of rough stone arising from the cutting and detailing. This was the response we got in the Estimates Committee meeting-small pieces of rough stone arising from the cutting and detailing-and it bears no relationship to the advertisement in the Canberra Times. Aussie Offcuts is advertising polished slabs large enough to make things like pavers and tables and of sufficiently good quality to sell commercially. This is inconsistent with the information supplied by the Authority and it needs a response, especially as the Authority stated during the hearing that further granite will need to be excavated to complete the landscaping. Yet we have seen it advertised and sold for a different purpose.With regard to the quantity of granite that has been used in the landscaping, I want to ask a series of questions of the Minister for Home Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), which I would like to be taken on notice if they cannot be answered now. What quantity of extra carmina granite was used for the curved walls contract and could I have a breakdown of who supplied it? How has this extra granite been used? What is the total area of courtyards paved with granite? What is the area of the new Parliament House courtyards landscaped with carmina granite panels sawn by Ferrobeton? What quantity of carmina granite was supplied by other stone contractors for the landscaping contract? How much additional granite is required to be excavated to complete landscaping the formal gardens? In relation to the previous comment about the successful tenderer for the so-called offcuts, I also ask the Authority: How many other tenders were submitted? What was the highest price offered by other tenderers? Were the tender details made known to the eventual successful tenderer?I also take issue with the Authoritys assertion that the reject stone was an integral part of the original plan. Why was it all honed before being accepted or rejected for the curved wall? Honed granite is unsuitable for use as courtyard pavers because it it too slippery when wet. The reject granite used for pavers would have had to be grit-blasted to remove the smooth honed finish. Indeed, when Ferrobeton was asked to quote on processing landscape panels in 1985, this included grit-blasting the granite to give it a non-slip surface. If the use of waste for pavers was an integral part of the plan, as the Authority claims, this is a gross waste and inefficiency.As my time has almost expired, I will not be able to go into the balance of the comments I wanted to make about ex-gratia payments, except to say that the answer given to me by the Authority does not coincide with the letters I have in my possession which were provided to me by the contractor. That deserves a further explanation. It seems that in the answer given to the Estimates Committee, one paragraph was quoted from the response by the Concrete-Holland Joint Venture, but it was taken out of context. I refer the officers to a letter dated 18 July 1984.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
194,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3106,"—I will also speak about the Parliament House Construction Authority. My intervention will perhaps give Senator Parer an opportunity to continue, if he wishes to do so. I raise a couple of matters which are of some concern. At the hearing of Senate Estimates Committee E, I asked the Parliament House Construction Authority what was the inflation element involved in the latest increase in the total cost of the project. I thought it was to $1,050m, but it could have been to $1,070m. I have forgotten because it keeps going up so much. The response was that the escalation content in the latest quarter was $4.68m. That means that the overall increase, as a percentage of the unexpended amount on the building, was 3.57 per cent in one quarter. Obviously, if one extrapolates that figure-3.57 per cent for one quarter-one gets an annual rate of inflation of about 14 per cent. The Parliament House Construction Authority, in its response, cautioned against extrapolating this to cover four quarters since the results would not take into account either changes in actual expenditure or additional costs.All I have to say to the Parliament House Construction Authority is that that seems to muddy the water. The simple reality is that in the latest quarter for which we have received information there was an inflation rate, in terms of building costs on this project, of 14 per cent-that is, building and fitting out costs because, as I understand it, the bulk of the building had been completed and what we are looking at, basically, is fitting out costs. I believe that the Committee and the people of Australia have a right to know why there should be a 14 per cent increase in fitting out costs in a period in which, as I understand it, the inflation rate was about 6 per cent. It seems to me that all through this project we have had continual examples of the cost escalation of this building being something like double the inflation rate. There has to be a simple reason.In the past, one reason given was that building costs have risen, according to an index in Canberra, by far more than the inflation rate. I wonder to what extent the very existence of the Parliament House construction has been an element in that index. In other words, it is a self-fulfilling cost rise; because Parliament House is increasing its costs at such a fast rate, the Canberra building index is increasing at such a fast rate and, therefore, the Parliament House construction cost increases at a faster rate than that of inflation. There may be a better explanation; I would like to hear it. I certainly believe that the Parliament House Construction Authority owes us an explanation as to why there should be such a continually large increase in the inflationary costs of building which is so much higher than the inflation rate with which the rest of the community manages to cope. That is particularly so with fitting out, because I would have imagined that, to the extent that so many things, such as carpets, seem to have been imported in this Australian Parliament House, we would have seen some diminution in cost as the Australian dollar has appreciated in recent times. Maybe there is another explanation which is beyond me, but we are owed an explanation and we do not have one.Another matter which is of concern to me, and which I believe the Committee should note, is the cost to the project of the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). Of course, the cost to the project of the BLF runs into multimillions of dollars. To a large extent, the Parliament House Construction Authority should be congratulated for the manner in which it endeavoured to handle the Builders Labourers Federation, which set out on a deliberate course of disruption on that project. The BLF believed that it had the Government over a barrel and this Government was quite happy to be there because it was determined to finish the project in time for the bicentennial celebrations-almost at any cost. Fortunately, the Parliament House Construction Authority did seek to stand up to the BLF to a considerable degree. Although I have been very critical of the Authority in many areas, I think it is only right to note that it did seek to resist the more outrageous demands of the BLF. However, that does not diminish in any sense my strong criticism of the sweetheart deals that were done on that site with other building unions. I believe that those deals have been disastrous, in a cost sense, and have led the pack around Australia in the way in which conditions have been allowed to increase far beyond those allowed for other Australian citizens.The people of Australia should recognise that it now looks as if the total estimated cost of settlements to contractors by way of compensation arising out of the deregistration of the BLF will reach three-quarters of a million dollars. We have to recognise what sorts of costs the disgraceful behaviour of the BLF have imposed on many buildings throughout Australia and, in fact, the costs will be faced by many Australians. In the construction of the new Parliament House the disruption involving deregistration of the BLF alone, by the time the final settlements have been reached, will have involved a total of $750,000. All Australians can thank the BLF and Mr Gallagher for adding $750,000, for that one item, to the cost of the new Parliament House project, apart from the multimillions of dollars that have been added by other industrial disruptions these people have caused.The cost of this industrial disruption has resulted despite the fact that on this project a practice has been followed which Senator Ray has conceded in this place is not sound. That practice is the Commonwealth, the people of Australia, paying the wages of union organisers on site, in an attempt, if you like, to buy silence, to buy cooperation, to buy the unions on the site so that they would not indulge in irresponsible behaviour. Parliament House Construction Authority representatives say that has worked. In other words, if this arrangement had not existed the level of industrial disputation would have been even worse. That may be so. They are experts in this area. I am not, and I accept what they say. All I know is that, despite the existence of that agreement, we have had massive levels of industrial unrest which are not due to national disputes but which relate to individual and specific disputes, and not only as a result of the BLF. The BLF was party to the 1984 agreement, as I understand it. Despite those arrangements there has been a substantial level of industrial unrest.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

196,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3106,"—I asked that question during the Senate Estimates Committee hearing. The cost to the new Parliament House project of full time union delegates in 1987-88, the current financial year, is estimated to be $353,000. Eight union delegates are to be paid for by the people of Australia rather than by the unions themselves. The Parliament House Construction Authority says that, with up to 500 employers and 2,300 employees engaged on site, delegates have made an important and generally responsible contribution towards the avoidance of disputes. That may be so, but the people of Australia are entitled to be aware of the fact that they have been paying, since 1984-85-for four years-about $350,000 a year, a total of $1.2m or so. We have further examples of the need for an added sense of responsibility within the union movement when it comes to arrangements and deals it is not prepared to stick to.The 1984 site agreement was not only generous; it was monumentally generous. The escalation figures that I referred to earlier, the huge increases in costs, at more than double the rate of inflation, relate to the fact that deals were done on the site with the union movement, particularly the 1984 site agreement, which cost the people of Australia multimillions of dollars and which involved obligations by the unions which were not totally delivered.In conclusion, I mention my concern about the opening of the new Parliament House, which was not in the hands of this Parliament but in the hands of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As I understand it, this Parliament had not taken over the running of the new construction. I asked Senator Button last week whether the Government would make available as soon as possible the names of the 500 or so people who, I understand, were on the personal list of those invited by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to attend the opening of the new Parliament House, and indicate in which hall they were seated.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Certainly, a large section of the main hall was occupied by invited guests of the Prime Minister, rather than parliamentarians or former parliamentarians. I also asked Senator Button to make available the list of distinguished former parliamentarians who were unable to be accommodated in the main hall and who were obliged to listen to the ceremony by loudspeaker in the external hall, where they saw nothing of the proceedings and where they did not participate in the ceremony, including former distinguished parliamentarians who participated in the decision, by the Cabinet of the Fraser Government, to build the new Parliament House. They made the decision, but they did not participate in the ceremony in the main hall. But never mind; people such as Mr Fred Daley and Mr Mick Young were obviously more equal than others. They are former parliamentarians, too, but they were in the main hall. I understand that Mr Stephen Loosley was in the main hall, as well.

205,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BISHOP","SE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3108,"—Perhaps Senator Ray was pre-emptive in his point of order. I meant to move on to how other decisions have been taken with regard to the new Parliament House. It has come to my attention today that a brochure is being handed out at the new Parliament House entitled `Australias New Parliament House. It is a glossy, attractive brochure with many nice designs. Printed on the side are the words, `This brochure is produced for the Parliament House Construction Authority. It says that the drawings were done by the architects to the Construction Authority, namely, Mitchell, Giurgola and Thorp. I table the brochure. The drawing of the House of Representatives chamber shows none other than the traditional Speakers chair. Superimposed on the drawing of the new chamber is the chair which it was said the architects did not want in the new chamber. We were then told that it could not be fitted through the door of the existing House of Representatives chamber to be carried up the hill. We then heard that the Labor Party caucused on this matter and determined that the chair would not be moved.The reason that I raise this matter is that I am concerned that at every avenue this Government has attempted to break with tradition in every possible way that it can. The vice-regal chair in this chamber will not be moved; the Presidents chair will not be moved. The matter which has been highly contentious and has been raised by many members of the public is the fact that the Speakers chair will not be taken to the new Parliament House; yet the drawings by the architects depict the Speakers chair, looking very fine in the new chamber in the new Parliament House.We have seen the attempt by the Labor Party to break with tradition by causing the new Senate chamber not to be decorated in the rich ruby red that we have here, but in some shade of crushed strawberry. Indeed, the colour of the new House of Representatives chamber is not the rich emerald green that is traditional, but a nice shade of pale peppermint that would look very fine with a pale apricot leather couch in any House and Garden magazine that one might care to pick up. It is not the sort of decor that one uses when building for tradition, for a minimum of the next 200 years. We have debated here today a motion of censure of the Government regarding the rushing through of the referendum Bills, which have not been carefully thought out and which are now to be subject to amendment. The real intent of those referendum bulls is to downgrade and finally phase out the Senate as an effective House of review. The hidden second agenda that this Government has is to try at every turn to breach and break with every tradition that we find important.I would be most interested to hear a reply from the Government as to why it pretended that it was the architects decision that the Speakers chair ought not be moved. We were then told that it would not fit through the door of the existing chamber without an enormous amount of money being spent. What is to happen to it, in any event? Some people might say that the matter is not of great moment; yet it runs to the very heart of the integrity and truthfulness of the Government. Why was there so much subterfuge to keep the chair out of the new House? Why is there so much subterfuge that the questions that are being posed in the referendum are soft, weak, attractive questions that do not go to the heart of the Bills? What does this Government really want Australia to have as its bicentennial birthday present? Is it really concerned to see a change to the extent that we would not have new Prime Minister Paul Keating, but President Keating? Is this the real agenda that is being set? Although these questions may seem peripheral--","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

209,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3110,"—We have just heard a little speech from Senator Bishop about the traditions of this place. She has just breached one of the longest standing traditions of this place-that we do not discuss personal House of Representatives matters, that we do not discuss House of Representatives estimates. Her comments concerned that area. In order to make a classic conservative statement, Senator Bishop breached one of the great conservative traditions of this place.One element that she raised is relevant to these estimates-that is, the drawing that was put out by the Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA). It was printed in 1982. I suppose Senator Bishop would argue that, once the House of Representatives had made its decision as to the future of the Speakers chair, we should have pulped all of those documents and reprinted them. Senator Michael Baume would then have attacked me for a waste of expenditure. It is quite clear that I cannot win by either a Punch or a Judy in this case, so I will move on to discuss other matters.Let me refer first to Senator Michael Baumes remarks. His speech, apart from the last two or three minutes, exemplified how Committee of the Whole debates on Estimates should proceed. He made political comments about the answers he has received, as cogently as he could, without referring another list of questions which, clearly, I could not answer in depth. That is the way in which the Committee of the Whole is supposed to deal with Estimates. That is the way in which Senator Michael Baume proceeded.He raised matters in the area of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The maximum number of guests, apparently-I qualify this because I have sought some information quickly-that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was allowed was 60 couples, not 500 people. A response to Senator Baumes request is with the Prime Ministers office. Therefore, I will not add to it. I reject, though, some of the implications made by Senator Baume. He referred to Mr Loosley. I do not know who invited Mr Loosley. He could have been a guest of a member of parliament, for all Senator Baume and I know. To throw in his name gratuitously--","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

211,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3110,"—Yes. He could have been a guest of any of a variety of people. Inviting people to the opening of a new Parliament House is a no-win position. Ideally, 20,000 or 30,000 people would have liked to be present in the main hall. I made the comment openly, after leaving the ceremony, that I thought that the opening was both good and bad. The good part about it was the basic informality that allowed people to wander through the chambers and to take photos. People were not supposed to take photos during the ceremony, but one of our distinguished past Prime Ministers, unfortunately, set a bad example. We would have to let that pass. The highlight was that there was not an enormous amount of pomp, people felt relaxed and enjoyed the ceremony, and there were not enormously long speeches. I thought the musical presentation was marvellous. A lot of aspects were good.The point I did not like was the fact that guests in the Members Hall did not have access to direct television coverage. I know that there were technical reasons for that. I still think that in retrospect it was a major mistake. Two of my guests were in the Members Hall. I know that they grumbled because all that they could hear was the radio broadcast. Five minutes later, John Elliott sat down in the row in front of them and made their day. They enjoyed watching his discomfort during the rest of the ceremony. However, the way that that was organised was not good enough. In retrospect the Prime Ministers Department and others would agree that that was the least satisfactory part of the opening-","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

213,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3110,"—I know that Senator Walters thinks I am a person with enormously wide knowledge, an all-knowing person. Funnily enough, I did not rush from the opening to ring Mick Young and say, `Mick, what did you think of the opening?. It is almost a matter for resignation that I did not do so. I humbly apologise for not ringing Mick Young, but I am certain that Senator Walters can whenever she likes. A more conclusive answer to Senator Baumes question will be provided. Senator Baume says that it should have been provided immediately. The Prime Minister has some priorities-the May statement and many other matters. He may not have regarded his most important priority that week to rush that answer through. If he did not regard it as such, I happen to agree with him.I will move on to some of the other points that were made. Senator Baume asked why the fit-out cost-not the actual building cost-was so high. I have been informed that one of the major factors in that is the escalating cost of electronics which made up the major part of that fit-out at the time. I cannot quantify that for Senator Baume. If I can get a further answer, I will have it forwarded to him. With an appreciating dollar certainly some of the costs of imported things would drop, but most of them were written out, quite properly, in the currency at the time the contract was entered into. They are not adjusted for exchange rates; it is not normal commercial practice. He also made a political point about the Builders Labourers Federation and its cost to the Australian taxpayer. I think that sums it up. Most of the other points went to the previous answers.Senator Parer asked for the cost of tenderers. I cannot answer that directly because it is commercial in confidence, but I can give him percentage figures that will indicate to him what the costs were. For a start, there were three tenderers in all. The winning tenderer was 800 per cent higher than No. 2 tenderer and 2,500 per cent higher than the other tenderer. In other words, the winning tenderer paid eight times as much as the second tenderer and 20 times as much as the third for that particular project. He asked: what about the tenderer having some connection with the PHCA or the project? There was actually no requirement on the person, either before or after he entered the tender, to notify the Authority of his intention to tender but he did notify it.The honourable senator referred to wastage. I think he has heard many explanations as to why the wastage was there. He has heard the explanation as to why it was factored in and the fact that, apart from the offcuts, the rest of the material was used in works around landscaping, et cetera. If it had not been used there, we would have had to get more material in for the landscaping. He said that many questions were unanswered and said that getting answers to them was harder than extracting teeth without an anaesthetic. We attempted to address most of the questions in the last Estimates committee meeting and I think all unanswered questions have subsequently been answered. They may be not to the honourable senators satisfaction, but we have attempted to answer them. He detailed some very specific questions that I simply cannot assist him with at this stage. They have been taken on notice and I will ask for them to be processed as quickly as possible. That, I think, covers the major points raised by Senator Michael Baume, Senator Parer and Senator Bishop.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
214,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",3111,"—In the Estimates Committee hearing for the Department of Administrative Services on 21 April I raised a number of questions relating to the Governments policy about the payment of Commonwealth accounts and the fact that the Government had embarked upon a new policy of now taking a minimum of 30 days to pay accounts. This matter was raised by a constituent of mine in the Northern Territory who is a significant contractor with the Department of Administrative Services. I will take the time of the Senate to read a letter from a director of Northern Territory Property Services Group to the Commonwealth Ombudsman regarding the payment of Commonwealth accounts. The letter reads:I am forced to bitterly complain re the recent decision handed down by somebody in Canberra re the payment of Commonwealth accounts for stores and services.This company carries out various cleaning works for Administrative Services in Darwin, and in particular the R.A.A.F. Base, Darwin.It has been clearly spelt out to us that even if invoices are submitted promptly at the end of each month and certified for payment, they will not be paid by Accounts Payable Section until the 30 days from date of invoice, has passed.In short, they deliberately sit in the basket for 30 days.This is a disgusting situation in a country that is supposed to be promoting free enterprise.To summarize the whole situation, the Commonwealth Government is saying to private enterprise: `We are going to use you money for another 30 days, you poor fools-like it or lump it.If something is not done re same, then I will go to the media for action. This is totally unacceptable.The letter is signed by Mrs Desley Muir, a director of Northern Territory Property Services Group. I raised the issues raised by Mrs Muir with officers of the Department on 21 April. A senior officer of the Department replied:Some new rules have been issued by the Department of Finance following a recent Government decision about changes to the process of paying accounts. In summary, those rules are: that payments shall be made on the due date as specified in the invoice. In other words, if the account specifies a due date of seven days, it will be paid on the seventh day. If it specifies a due date of 14 days, it will be paid on the fourteenth day. If no due date is specified, the normal period of 30 days will apply, in which case the account will be paid on the thirtieth day, not before.Further on the officer said that it did not apply just to this Department, of course, and that the Commonwealth-wide change had been made by the Government. So the Government has determined to bring in a new policy-that it will not pay for 30 days accounts that appear before it with no specified date on them. This is not normal in normal commercial enterprises. In any business situation if an account is in order and it passes for payment, one expects it to be paid as soon as is conveniently possible. In a subsequent answer that has been circulated from the Estimates Committee my attention was drawn to the `Finance Implementation Circular No. 1 of 4 June 1987 and the amended `Finance Directions, Section 25. The detailed document goes into much more detail about how these instructions require that accounts be paid on a due date. In an answer given to the Estimates Committee on 21 April it was stated:The due date would be 28 days (allowing 2 extra days for the cheque to be received within the 30 days), unless alternative terms, usually involving discounts-to the Commonwealth, of course-are arranged with suppliers.So blackmail is also being pushed onto an organisation-unless it can introduce a form of discounting of its pricing, the account will not be paid for at least 28 days. The instructions to officers also include some very interesting statements. One instruction states that the invoice to be entered on each claim that does not contractually specify payment earlier than 30 days is to be identified. Further in that circular there is an instruction which states:You should immediately change the focus of your entire accounts processing procedures to emphasise the due date. Accounts should be batched on that basis from 1 July 1987. Current staff should be trained to recognise that each claim received must bear the due date for payment and every effort should be made in the processing cycle of the claim to meet that due date.That implies that the due date for payment is 28 or 30 days hence from the date of the invoice, if it comes into the Commonwealth. Further in that Finance circular is the statement:From 1 July 1987 departments should sort, process and batch according to due date while keeping cash management consideration in mind-I stress this point-by not paying too early particularly for large value payments eg over $1,000.I think it is worth repeating that this is the decision of the Government that is flowing through to the way in which it will process and deal with people such as cleaning contractors in the way in which it does. Again, the quote states:Departments should sort, process and batch according to due date while keeping cash management consideration in mind by not paying too early particularly for large value payments eg over $1,000.In the revised section 25 of the Finance Directions, this is again reinforced in more formal and legalistic terms, including an instruction to the effect that all purchase orders issued must clearly indicate a number of things such as addresses and contact names and everything else, but including:(c) the terms of payment-30 days from acceptance of goods or services and the receipt of a correctly rendered invoice unless other terms are agreed to with the supplier;Here is a situation where the Commonwealth Government has made a very deliberate decision to pick up credit. This practice affects many people such as cleaning contractors and others who give services and would expect to have accounts processed in a much more normal way. During the next Estimates committee meetings I am going to pursue the implication for the various voluntary and community organisations which receive grants and subsidies from government. Does it mean that they will also be placed on this deferred payment schedule? What is the subsequent cost to groups like Mrs Muirs cleaning service or the various voluntary and community organisations which will now suffer a subsequent loss of interest income? I think this is an appalling decision by government. It is one which certainly needs to be seriously addressed and reviewed.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is general Government policy and I suggest the honourable senator pursue it with the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) at the next meeting of the Estimates Committee. As the honourable senator has indicated, the matter he raised covers all areas of government, not just those dealt with by the Department of Administrative Services, which has been responding to a direction from the Department of Finance. I was interested to hear the honourable senator say that the matter he raised was `a great attack against private enterprise. This is a normal private enterprise condition. Businesses very rarely pay immediately for any demand made on them. People who find that onerous normally indicate on their dockets that the account should be paid within seven days. But it would not be appropriate to pursue this matter which, as I say, applies generally to Government departments. I assume that the honourable senator indicated rather than threatened that he would take this matter up again.

The answer was given some time after the question was asked at the Estimates Committee hearing and, consequently, I have not had an opportunity to take the matter any further until now. I recognise that it may not be possible to get answers now, but I would like to get what I can. The Department of Defence indicated in attachment B to its answers the properties that are to be disposed of by the Department of Administrative Services for the Department of Defence in 1987-88. That list included the following rifle ranges: Dorrigo, Mudgee, Young, Bathurst and the Anzac rifle range, Sydney in New South Wales; Biggenden, Pimpama, the Belmont rifle range in Brisbane, Bundaberg, Coolangatta, Dalby in Queensland; and Pontville in Tasmania.I would like to know just what is the current situation in regard to the sale of these 12 Army rifle ranges. I note that there is only one month to go before the end of the financial year. I wonder whether all of the rifle ranges have been sold. I would like to know how many have been sold and for how much money? I would also like to know whether there has been a change of heart on the part of the Government in light of the real concern around the country about the sale of these rifle ranges. A great deal of concern has been expressed to the Opposition and also, I am sure, the Government, about the loss to the country of facilities that have been used by rifle clubs and members of the defence forces to practice rifle shooting. I wonder whether in fact the sale has gone ahead, particularly in the case of the Anzac rifle range.I would like to know how much money has been received by the Government for the rifle ranges that have been sold. What has happened to the money that has been received? Has it gone back into Consolidated Revenue or is there any way in which it can be passed to the Defence Department, which once again, I think for the third Budget in a row, has been cut back.I wish to refer to a rifle range which is closer to the heart of my constituents-the range simply described as `Pontville Tas. If this is truly the Pontville Rifle Range as we know it, I would like the Government to say what the intention is for rifle training by members of the defence forces. Pontville is really the only rifle range which is accessible to the Brighton Army Camp, where all of the reserve and main basic training is done in Tasmania. If the Department could give me the exact locality of the range at Pontville, that will help to identify whether it is the range that I assume it is.

218,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator NEWMAN","BE4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",3113,"—Perhaps that is so. Maybe we are into privatisation after all-by the back door. The list also contains a number of properties scheduled for sale which are described as married quarters. The list describes those properties as follows: `Sydney NSW, married quarter flats, `Sydney NSW, married quarters and `Melbourne Victoria, married quarters. Those entries are very vague. We are not given any indication of the number of houses and where they are. I would like to know all of those things as well as whether in fact they have been sold, and, if so, for how much money? Once again, I would like to know what is going to happen to the income from those sales. Will it go back into Consolidated Revenue, as I fear it must, or have special arrangements been made for it to be transferred to the Defence Housing Authority to enable substitute married quarter housing to be provided for the defence forces? It seems to me that at every turn the defence budget itself or the Defence Housing Authority budget is being short changed in terms of funds. If these bodies are giving up assets for the sake of the Government trying to fulfil its promises on assets sales, are they being given the benefits of any of this income to help them replace training facilities and married quarters, both of which we know they need badly?Finally, I refer to the item described as `Launceston Tasmania, Army Depot. I am informed that this depot in fact is not in Launceston but in George Town. If it is in Launceston, it means that it is either the historic Patterson Barracks or it is the only working Army depot in the north-east of Tasmania, and I cannot believe that the Government is intending to sell that. It could possibly be a small depot at George Town, about an hours drive from Launceston. If that is the case, it seems that the Department of Defence has been pretty inaccurate with its listing. I wonder whether the Department of Administrative Services knows what it is supposed to be selling? If so, has it sold the depot and for how much? If not, when does it expect a sale?","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[7]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

221,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3114,"—I now wish to raise a matter which I believe involves the scandalous waste of public money and which relates to empty properties owned by the Commonwealth. The Minister for Home Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) was very kind to remark that I had used this debate appropriately and correctly by raising matters that had been answered-perhaps unsatisfactorily, but nonetheless answered-as a result of questions arising from Senate Estimates committees. If I have behaved properly, the Minister has also fulfilled his role, which is to obfuscate and create impossibilities for the Opposition in trying to find out what the facts are. I commend the Minister because he has done very well. We have persistently asked this Government-and I have asked the public servants who were here during Estimates committee hearings-for simple answers to simple questions.I will repeat the question I asked and the Committee can find out how simple it was: Did any property owned or rented by the Department-and I asked every Department this-remain empty or significantly underutilised during the past 12 months? The only responses I have had, with one exception, have related to renting. The departments answered about properties rented. In fact, I got a fairly unsatisfactory answer to the question of what was rented. We did end up finding out that the Government has been renting something like $6.5m-worth of property that it has not been occupying and the departments say that that figure is a decided improvement on how badly they did the year before. The Government can judge its capacity by doing less badly, apparently.The essential element concerns property owned by the departments. It is incredible that we are debating the appropriations when there have been no effective answers, apart from those from Australia Post, to a question asked properly in these committee hearings over a month ago. The purpose of this debate is to be able to deal with the questions and answers from the Estimates committee hearings. It is improper for this Government to bring on this debate before it has provided answers which it undertook to give. We are still waiting for those answers. The Minister did respond to a question asked last week by Senator Patterson by obfuscating and talking around the subject-and she even asked a supplementary question-without dealing with the question asked, which was about owned property. The Minister talked about how it would be a herculean task to find out. He said, `We may have to make a judgment as to the amount of resources we would need to devote to answering the question. He did say that, in anticipation of the fact that he will be asked these questions at the next Senate Estimates hearing, he will have the figures prepared.The simple fact is that everything that has emerged indicates that the Government does not know what properties it owns-I underline `owns-that are either vacant or underutilised. If that is the way that Government thinks it should conduct its business it seems to be pretty incompetent. There is a suggestion that the figure really is multimillions of dollars-worth. I object to the fact that, having had what I understand to be indications from departmental officers that they would be trying to find an answer on owned property, we are still waiting and now are having a debate without that answer.The only answer we got from the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) was that it was not feasible to compare its property utilisation this financial year with last financial year. Let us forget about the comparison; let us have the figures. Is not being able to compare the figures any excuse for not providing the figures for the current year? What figures is the Department not using now? The sort of response we got was that because the Department of Administrative Services was formed by the Administrative Arrangements Order of 1987 and is an amalgamation of elements of eight former departments, therefore it is not feasible to compare the figures. That is the typical sort of bureaucratic nonsense that this chamber should not have to put up with. It is a deliberate attempt to deceive this chamber and the people of Australia. It is a disgrace that the bureaucracy should be allowed to get away with that kind of response.The reality is that multimillions of dollars-worth of properties that the Government owns are empty. There are multimillions of dollars-worth of property in the hands of the Department of Administrative Services, ready for disposal. We know that from the answer we got from Australia Post, which complained to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that the Department of Administrative Services was monumentally incompetent in disposing of these properties, taking an average of two years to dispose of property that had come to it for disposal. We have certainly found out from Australia Post-and I commend it-about the extraordinarily high level of massively underutilised properties. For example, a major property in Melbourne worth $55m, with several floors, has been unoccupied, I think, for five years.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[9]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

223,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3114,"—As Senator Newman says, it is disgraceful. I have circulated a list to people who are interested, and I am prepared to provide it to anyone else, of some of these properties that have been empty for many years-one at Box Hill for six years and one at Somerville for 18 years. So the list goes on. A property at Balranald has been empty for 8 1/2 years and part of the former post office site at St Marys has been empty for 15 years. The Sydney South post office has been empty for 13 years. It is just incredible. Australia Post says that to a large extent this is due to laxity or the delays involved in disposing of these properties through the Department of Administrative Services.The fact is that Australia Post as a statutory authority has replied; I have not yet got a response from Telecom Australia. One wonders what Telecoms figures are going to be like because, after all, the last annual report of Telecom shows that the buildings it owns at cost are valued at $1,300m. That is even more than the new Parliament House cost to build, so it must be extensive property holding. The sum of $1,300m is an increase during the year of $145m. Telecom has spent an extra $145m on property. I simply ask in this chamber the questions we could not get answered until now in Senate Estimates hearings: How much of that property is empty? How long has it been empty? What is its value? Why is it still empty? Unless the Government really is determined to hide behind this extraordinary reluctance to come clean, I can assume only that either the total figure is scandalous or it is so incompetent that it does not know the figure.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[9]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

225,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3114,"—I have already dealt with leased property. We know that $6.5m was spent on leased property which was not occupied last year. But this is a question on owned property-a far bigger and more substantial issue. That is why Senator Ray, in his reply to Senator Patterson, chose not to answer the major element of the question on owned property. It is important that we get appropriate answers. On the question of leased property, Telecom is paying $92m in rent. That is an increase of something like $15m this year; and on top of that it has lease commitments, apart from those rental properties, of $340m, as shown in the latest consolidated accounts. That is an increase of something like $80m per year, as I understand it, from the consolidated accounts.I believe that with enormous numbers like that we are entitled to an honest answer from the Government. It is not honest, when asked about the total of owned and leased properties, to limit the answer to leased properties. I simply ask the Government to come clean. Senator Newman raised the question of defence properties. I asked the Department of Defence, which said that it could not possibly answer that question. It apparently has no idea and I am not quite certain. It did have a list of properties that it wanted to get rid of. The Department of Defence could not answer what properties were underutilised, or how many had been empty and for how long. It is a bit of an impertinence asking a department of the Commonwealth whether it is actually using the properties that the taxpayers money has been spent in buying. What an impertinence, how dare I suggest that I should get an answer! The only answer that I got in the Senate Estimates Committee hearing was that there was a list of properties planned for disposal. The Department of Defence, in its response, stated:The practice has been that Defence property has been declared to the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) for disposal. The property passes to the control of DAS.Honourable senators will notice the reply I got from DAS said that it had no property underutilised. That is interesting. Maybe it regards this as stock in hand and, therefore, it can excuse itself from replying honestly to the question. However, the property passed to the control of the Department of Administrative Services. The document continues:In addition for FY 87-88 the Government directed that as a part of broader financial initiatives Defence should itself undertake some additional property disposal.The Department of Defence then supplied two lists. It stated:The Defence properties at Attachment A are planned for disposal by the Department of Defence in 1987-88. Additionally, the former Defence properties at Attachment B which had previously been declared for disposal to the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) are planned for disposal by DAS in 1987-88.Those Tasmanian properties are in Attachment B, which Senator Newman referred to, which means that they have already gone over to the Department of Administrative Services for disposal and there is an enormous list of the properties concerned. How many of these properties have been idle and for how long? For how long has taxpayers money been wasted? Is there a good reason why they should have been held which has suddenly disappeared as the Government rushes round making money at this stage selling them off with this new-found enthusiasm about privatising bodies, particularly surplus defence properties? It may be the case with some of the properties listed in Attachment A, which the Government is trying to sell off-such as Navy married quarters in Neutral Bay-that there are different views within the Navy. Who knows what its view is as to whether these are surplus defence properties. I do not know. The Department has been good enough to provide us with a list of properties that are to be sold which have apparently been declared surplus for some time. I believe that it is, therefore, fair to inquire: How long have these properties been surplus? How long have they been empty? What are the values of those properties? It seems to me that this whole issue is one of monumental incompetence and, to make it worse, a continual cover up. Why have we not been told? What is the problem in telling the Senate the facts? I am interested to see that in regard to another issue I raised-that of the incompetence of the Department of Administrative Services in disposing of items-Telecom Australia had said that it would cost a lot less to do its own property disposals than to rely on the Department of Administrative Services. Telecom stated:Almost since its inception Telecom has had the staff to operate independently of DOLGAS which to a very large extent merely duplicates the Telecom effort.Telecom already has 112 staff nationally engaged in the property function. Of these 34 i.e. over 30% hold formal real estate qualification and many others are currently undertaking courses of study.Savings to Telecom, if granted exemption from the Land Acquisitions Act-in other words, having to work through the Department of Administrative Services-would exceed $1 million a year.Telecom regards the `middleman role of DOLGAS as a constraining influence on it in the pursuit of handling the acquisition, leasing and disposal of property efficiently in carrying out the function of providing telecommunications services to the nation in a business-like manner.Every bit of evidence we have seen indicates that this Government is handling this issue monumentally incompetently.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[9]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

231,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3116,"—The way the question was put to me, it was all government property. That is why I responded that it may be an herculean task, especially for me and my Department, to respond in that particular way and to respond accurately to make sure that we had not missed a lighthouse here, a rented property there or some other vacant land. That is why I said it was herculean. What we did first of all was get the rent figures. Answers at the Estimates Committee hearing were given initially and later amended. I stress that they were later amended.The first thing I should mention is that forgone rent was 1.3 per cent, but it depends on the definition and how one approaches these matters. We took the least generous definition to the Department and re-evaluated that. We came up with a figure of $6.2m up to the middle of May in forgone rent, which was about 2 per cent. When compared with other commercial enterprises, it was reasonable and, compared with previous government performance, was a large improvement. I will take the honourable senator back to the Fraser days. The Fraser Government would have been delighted if it had 2 per cent in dead rent in those days. One only has to go to the record of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and other committees to establish that point. However, I think we have at least satisfactorily answered the question on rented property.We now come to government-owned properties. I can only answer in terms of the Department of Administrative Services, which admittedly is used as the biggest department in any way in dealing with these matters. There are really two questions: Firstly, what properties are vacant of office accommodation? We are not talking about all government properties because that is impossible to answer. I am willing to have a go at that in a moment and give a qualified answer. The second key question is: How much does it cost the taxpayer? I cannot answer that because rent has not been charged on those buildings in the past; not in our Government, nor in the previous Government. I am not going to go into too much detail, but that policy is under active review at the moment and will be subject to a Cabinet decision in the next few weeks. I cannot explore that any further without breaching confidence. That is the reason why it is so difficult to establish the forgone cost. Let me give an example: Let us say that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs moves in to a government-owned building. It is not charged rent and a nominal rent has never been established historically. We can argue that it should be and the Government is very sympathetic to that. As I say, those matters are under very active consideration at the moment. But it would have been an herculean task from scratch to apply an attributed rent to every one of those government agencies in a government building; it would have been a massive task. We are not responsible in essence for Telecom Australia and the post office. We are not responsible for the Defence Department. There is not a central register of all government properties; there never has been as far as I can tell.Let us look at some of the vacant properties. In Queensland there is the Commonwealth Centre, Brisbane, A Block, which has 17 floors and part of the first floor is vacant; the Commonwealth Centre, Brisbane, B Block, has seven floors and four floors are vacant or partly vacant; the Taxation Building in Adelaide Street, Brisbane, has 12 floors of which three floors are vacant. Some of this is due to ongoing refurbishment. In Victoria, there is 11 William Street, Melbourne, which has 16 floors of which 12 floors are vacant; and Jensen House, Melbourne, has 12 floors of which one floor is vacant. In the Australian Capital Territory there is the Albermarle Building, Woden, which has eight floors of which three floors are vacant; the Alexander Building, Woden, has eight floors of which one floor is vacant; the Edmund Barton Building, Barton, has five floors and parts of the five floors are vacant; and the Treasury Building, E Block, Parkes, has three floors of which three floors are vacant. The note I have is slightly inaccurate. A small area in West Block is also vacant at the moment after last weeks storm. I add that for accuracy. I am not in a position yet to give a percentage figure for all government owned buildings that have vacant space in them. I would have to know their size, et cetera.Senator Baumes concerns are relevant and justified, but saying that public servants or Ministers have just been dragging the chain is not justifiable. Given past practices and the failure to calculate rent on government buildings, these figures do not come easily. The figures on rent did, as it turned out; we had a central register. It has been measured for quite a period, so it was a relatively easy task. It is not too hard a task to identify government buildings controlled by the Department of Administrative Services and say how much area is vacant. However, going across the whole gamut of every statutory authority in every department would be a rather large task. I guess by asking each department, though, and getting an answer it would eventually be established-but at a fairly large cost.I reject the implication that things are absolutely out of control. There will always be examples of vacant buildings being an obvious waste of taxpayers money. There will always be examples of dead rent. The real question to consider is whether these amounts are abnormal and whether they are vastly different from what a commercial developer and property owner would face. We also have to look at the historical trend. With rented properties, on which we have accurate figures, we can say that the historical trend is good. Basically it is on the way down. I cannot give figures, other than for space, for government owned buildings for which no rent is charged. If ever we move to a system-again I do not want to anticipate-where rent is charged to each department occupying a government building the sort of figures Senator Baume is seeking will be a lot more easily accessible and much more readily available.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[10]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

No doubt it will be grateful. I must say I find the Ministers reply totally unacceptable. The Department is fully aware of this issue because I have raised it for over a year, in particular in relation to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commissions use, or lack of use, of 80 William Street, Sydney. The Department is perfectly well aware of the fact that I have been nagging the hell out of it and the Government over the fact that something like $4m in dead rent has been paid on that one building while it has taken something like two years to fit it out.In fact, I have a response from the Department which deals with that very issue. It is a response to a question I asked, at Senate Hansard page E101, about whether 80 William Street was fully occupied yet, because past answers had said it had taken a long time to fit out, for various reasons, and that was why it was still unoccupied. The Department responded that the fitout was delayed due to a plumbers strike, the non-supply of door locks, late changes in client briefing requirements for a court signalling system and the provision of 24-hour air-conditioning for guard posts. There are other reasons, too, such as the fact that in the original design brief approximately 905 square metres was set aside for use by the proposed industrial courts. But we have not passed that legislation yet.The fact is that the Department is fully aware that while areas are being refurbished, while fitout is going on, they have been classified as empty space because they are not being used by the department for whom it was designed. The Department responded to another question concerning the Department of Social Security in Wollongong and dead rent during the fitout period. The Department of Social Security space there has been empty and unusable for a longer period than the office space has been used. The Department has now left that area anyway, having spent something like $650,000 on either rent or fitout and having used the space for only a very short time. The fitout time was longer than the time the space was eventually occupied for.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[13]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

This is the sort of thing that the failure to have effective control over property has brought us to-monumental waste. This kind of obfuscation from the Department is simply unacceptable. I remind the Minister of the Departments response to the following Senate Estimates question which I put to every department and statutory authority:Did any property owned or rented by the Department remain empty or significantly underutilised during the past 12 months? If so, for what length of time and for what reasons was it empty or underutilised? If the property is owned, what is its value, area and address?The Minister will note that I did not say imputed lease or rent costs. I might say that Australia Post had no problem answering that question. Apparently it is the only honest department or instrumentality. It actually came forward with the information. It was either the only honest or the only competent one to come forward and tell its story. Not all of it was happy reading, but at least Australia Post told us. I also asked:If the property is rented or leased, what is the amount of this rental and the address and the area of the property.In response to that question the Department of Administrative Services, which has now conceded that it has all these empty properties around Australia, said:There are no properties, owned, rented or leased for use by this Department which are empty or significantly under-utilised.I object to being misled in this disgraceful way by any bureaucracy.

I reject his attempt to justify what is in fact a totally inaccurate reply in the kindly, sweetness and light manner that he did a little while ago. The interesting thing about this matter is the deliberate choice of words by this Department. It says:There are no properties, owned, rented or leased for use by this Department which are empty or significantly under-utilised.Do we have a definition of `for use by this Department? This sneaky term has been used-I emphasise the word `sneaky-in the context of the Department being advised by me at Senate Estimates hearings that we had asked this question of every department and statutory body and they had all said, `We do not look after our property; you would have to ask Administrative Services.

Senator Baume said the Department of Administrative Services was sneaky when it refers to only itself, but he put specific questions to every department.

The biggest question raised in my mind is whether in future we will allow questions to be placed on notice straightaway.

Of course, there was a deposit of 6,263,085,500 yen prior to that. Therefore, the total amount received was 57.7 billion yen. Translated into Australian dollars it comes to a figure of $606,795,231.

The Minister at the table says that it is not common practice to take forward cover or other covering arrangements in a case like this. If the Commonwealth is going to get itself involved in selling off its silver and other assets around the world, it is about time we started to look at our arrangements in terms of taking appropriate exchange rate provisions, because a loss of $30m to $40m-I think that would be the range-is a very large loss indeed. I am not necessarily asking for a comment, but the Minister can respond if he wants. I would urge the Government-this is an area for which I think the Minister has responsibility-to look at this question of the appropriate arrangements to be made with currency cover in a world of rapidly changing exchange rates, when we may be involved in continuing operations of this nature around the world, either in the case of purchases or sales of assets.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The point I am making is that we are now in an environment where a consideration of doing that is very important indeed.I would like to raise two other matters about the Department of Administrative Services before raising a couple of points on the Australian Electoral Commission. The first point relates to the method that the Department of Administrative Services is using to price some of its services that are sold to the public. I have in mind in particular the pricing structure for the sale through the government bookshops of reports of government agencies and departments, for example, those in relation to the Ministers own Department. Since the new administrative arrangements in July of last year I understand that the Department of Administrative Services has been responsible for producing and selling the following annual reports: for the old Department of Housing and Construction, the Australian Electoral Commission, the Parliament House Construction Authority, the Australian Archives, the old Department of Local Government and Administrative Services and the old Department of Special Minister of State. The cost of production of those reports ranges fairly widely. For example, the old Housing and Construction annual report cost $3.78 while the report of the Australian Electoral Commission cost $5.06. There is quite a range in the figures that have been provided to me.What is more surprising to me is the variation in the mark-up that has been accorded to the various reports so far as their sale to the public is concerned. The advice I have is that, for example, the report of the old Department of Housing and Construction cost $3.78 per unit but it was actually sold for $14.95. The report of the Archives cost $4.10 and it was sold for only $5.90. So there is obviously an enormous variation between the mark-ups from one to the other. I would like to know what formula is adopted by the Department and what is proposed in the future so far as its pricing policy for these and other services that it may sell.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[19]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The amount of taxpayers money that is being spent on the promotion of the Labor Government, its prominent members and its policies, is quite outrageous. The amount that we saw spent on the Priority One program, the promotion of the prices and incomes accord, not to mention the fringe benefits tax campaign, is staggering political aggrandisement in using taxpayers money for advertising purposes. The focal point of much of this advertising has not just been the Government but personalities, and in particular the amount of money that has been spent on promoting the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is out of this world. That was particularly the case with the Priority One campaign, but there were many others as well.The other point that concerns me considerably, and I know many others in the community, is that the agencies that have been handling virtually all of the Governments work have had very strong and defined links with the Australian Labor Party. I ask whether the new system of advertising that the Government now has in place, and which I think was announced earlier this year-whereby we have three master agencies handling all media placements-will operate in a way that will in any way correct the very glaring deficiencies and concerns that I have mentioned in relation to the political focus as distinct from what ought to be the real focus of government advertising under this Government?","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[19]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

We have a master agency that books the space and then it assesses who it wants to do the creative work, if you like. I think that that is a fairly sensible system, because it means that the placement agency can return a lot of the money into government coffers by being a master booking agency. There has been absolutely no political direction as to which agencies get advertisements. The master agency determines who gets the creative work; I certainly do not. Those decisions do not come before the information coordination branch or the Ministerial Council associated with it. I suggest that one gets into these systems of devolution out of self-protection. The last thing one wants to be involved in is which research company does the research and which advertising company goes ahead and does the creative work. I do not get involved in that and I am certain that the master agency has no desire to get involved.Senator Short raised the broader question of his interpretation as to whether government advertising is directed towards the Governments good and its own self-aggrandisement. My observation from the side is that sometimes I wish it did. Most are information campaigns rather than Government advertising per se. The honourable senator referred to the fringe benefits tax advertising. If that picked up new votes for the Labor party, I would like to know about it.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[20]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

There is a whole range of government information campaigns. Often in opposition one thinks that they impinge on a political campaign. I remember the selling of the 1982 Budget and the little family advertisements saying that it was a good family Budget and so on, based on a post-Budget survey. At that time we argued that that was fairly political. Those fine judgments are very hard to make as to how political such advertisements are. On the other hand, I would not like to see simply the assertion that every government information campaign is political, thus preventing governments being able to promote certain policies. For instance, it would be disappointing if we could not advertise the family package in some way. I saw an advertisement for the family package in the football Record four weeks ago and Sky Channel has also been used. We are trying to reach a specific market of the very people likely to take up that package. I deny that specific firms are given jobs because of political connections. Some firms with political connections may well get the job if they tender for it because theirs is the best project, but there is no ministerial interference from me to suggest that X firm or Y firm should get a job.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[20]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

It may well be that once a campaign is under way, or prior to a campaign getting under way, it is shown to the information coordination branch to see whether it is up to scratch. At that stage we may put comments, but I am talking about the choosing of an agency. The information coordination branch gets involved in making sure that each government department that wants to advertise goes through the due process in choosing the correct agency, be it for advertising, public relations or anything else. What I am saying is that I do not centrally direct, let us say, Minister X, to use such and such an agency. I do not do that not only as a matter of principle but also as a matter of self-interest, because the accusation could always be made that I directed the Minister to A, B or C.

I am not questioning his move to Victoria Park or to any office; what I am questioning is how the cost of $172,000 was arrived at. The figure has not been denied by anyone. It seems that the cost did not include rent and the property is not freehold. I think I am correct in saying that it involved merely refurbishing or fitting out the premises. Having a little experience in building, I know that one can build a lot in Perth for $172,000. That would be the all-up cost, including air conditioning, and the construction would be of double brick. I ask what the Government got for that amount. I do not know how many square metres are involved, but if the size is anywhere near what I think it is, I consider it to be a big rip-off. As the Minister knows, I moved into an office in a new centre in Perth in the last couple of weeks. I think that about 120 square metres was subdivided in a new building and one of the walls was already there. Yet the whole cost was $30,000. In view of my experience in building, I consider this to be a hell of a rip-off.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[23]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The first thing I would like to raise is the state of the electoral rolls, particularly in view of the referendums presumably coming up in the next few months and the State elections also coming up, certainly in my own State of Victoria. In the Estimates committee hearings, on other occasions and also in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform it was generally accepted that the ideal timing for habitation reviews would be each 12 months. Given that, at present, habitation reviews usually take place with a longer gap between them, where does the Minister put the importance of habitation reviews in his priorities when it comes to spending within the Electoral Commission? There is widespread concern and questioning at the moment about the cleanliness of the rolls. It seems to the Opposition that the habitation review is the key to cleanliness of the rolls. It worries me that we do not give it a higher priority. Where does the Minister put it in his list of priorities?","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
286,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3124,"—There had never been annual habitation reviews, or habitation reviews with absolute regularity, until the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform said that they had to take place every two years. The solution is further Commonwealth-State agreements. No honourable senator would believe that it is fair that the Commonwealth pick up all the costs of maintaining the electoral roll. Essentially, we do, although we are negotiating an agreement with South Australia that it pick up part of the cost. The highest priority is for me, and the Electoral Commission in particular, to try to convince the States that they should be involved in picking up part of the cost of the Electoral Commissions maintenance of the rolls because they are all beneficiaries of it. If that process can be speeded up, we might get to annual habitation reviews, which would go a long way towards satisfying people that the rolls are relatively clean.There are two ways the rolls can get out of kilter. Firstly, there is the habit of citizens not to fill out their enrolment cards, having moved. That is almost a natural process in our electoral system. Citizens tend to change their licences, their post office addresses and other things, but most overlook the electoral area. The second thing that could be said about unclean rolls is that they were deliberately stacked. There is no evidence that that occurs. I would not like anyone listening to this debate to think that the so-called lack of cleanliness of the rolls relates to that.On the first subject, the rolls have always changed behind people moving. The figure I have seen is that about 16 per cent of people move every year. I am not so sure whether they all move from one electorate to another; some move within an electorate. That high turnover will always create problems. I suppose that we could adopt a series of draconian measures to force people to be on the roll. We do not want to do that. One of the suggested uses for the Australia Card was to supply an automatic change of people on the roll. That is no longer an option. We have to get that balance, if you like, between keeping elections clean and democratic and protecting peoples civil liberties. When Senator Short asks me what my priority is, I say that I am satisfied that a habitation review every two years is sufficient. We set ourselves a target to have the best electoral system in the world. I think it would be enhanced if the review were every year. The solution is to have joint Commonwealth-State agreements on rolls, similar to the one in South Australia. States would pick up half the costs, which would leave us with far more money available for such measures as habitation reviews.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[26]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
287,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",3125,"—The Minister for Home Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) will recall that during the Estimates Committee E hearings in April the Electoral Commissioner said:. . . the habitation review in the middle of last year, which was a particularly extensive and effective one, and the non-voter action following the July election, which finished around about December last year or January this year, have left the rolls in a sufficiently good state.In the same response to a question I asked, he said that the reason why 60,000 voters in Victoria who were taken off the rolls in December were spotted in the first instance was-and I quote:. . . they had not voted in July. We had spotted them for that and were in the process of removing them.That was as at the end of December. I confess to a considerable amount of concern at such a response to my question. That figure of 60,000 represents more than 2 per cent of the total voting population in Victoria. If more than 60,000 who were not listed accurately on the roll at the time of the July election were picked up only because they had not voted, that must make people-certainly me, and from the responses I get from around Australia, many other people-very concerned about the cleanliness of the rolls.I return to the importance of the habitation reviews and the other aspects which affect the cleanliness of the rolls. In particular, how could the Electoral Commissioner believe that the rolls were very clean when the only reason we found out that they were unclean was the fact that 60,000 people did not vote? Perhaps that is more of a comment than a question, but it seems to me to highlight the very significant importance of having a regular habitation review. Some of the answers to questions that were provided subsequent to the Committee hearings have confirmed my concerns about the cleanliness of the rolls. For example, I placed some questions on notice, to which I have now received answers. The first of those questions was: How many deletions should have been made to the rolls, but were not, prior to the July 1987 election? The answer that I received was as follows:Because the 1986-87 electoral roll review process was interrupted by the calling of the 11 July election, it is not possible to say how many people would have been removed from the rolls by objection had the review been followed to its conclusion.Another question I asked was:What was the degree of inaccuracy in the electoral rolls at the time of the July 1987 election?The answer was:The degree of inaccuracy of the electoral rolls at any particular time is not susceptible to direct measurement, because there is no way of determining, from ABS or other data, the number of persons eligible for enrolment at a given time.The third question was:Was any investigation carried out into whether votes had been recorded under the names of persons whose names should have been deleted?The response was:No.Then there were a few words of explanation. It continued:That a vote was cast in the name of a person who, had events followed a different course, would have been removed from the role by objection, is not even prima facie evidence of any irregularity. There was therefore no justification for any special investigations.Those answers to me are quite unsatisfactory because I think they leave in the mind of the reader a very real question as to whether the Electoral Commission can vouch with any degree of confidence for the accuracy of the rolls. I say that more as comment rather than necessarily to seek a response. It is an issue that is of very widespread concern in a way that it has not been for many years.Therefore, I would have expected the Government to be placing a high degree of priority on ensuring that the rolls are in a better state. We have only to talk to the divisional returning officers around Australia to know that it is widely accepted that the rolls are not clean at the moment. That is a basic problem in a democratic system. The whole basis for a democracy is that there are electoral rolls in which one can place a high degree of confidence. I do not think that is the situation. We have slipped very badly in recent years. It is a matter of quite major concern.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[27]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He has gone into that rhetoric with absolutely no basis. We do have processes of objection. We have set procedures before peoples names can be taken off the roll. Until those procedures are undertaken and completed, they are entitled to be on the roll.That attitude is not peculiar to this side of politics. I remember from being on the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform that, when we debated the extent of the obligation on the Electoral Office to contact people whose names were going to be taken off the roll, it was very strongly and forcefully put that every effort should be made to contact those people before their names were taken off the roll.

That may well indicate that there are some problems. But I am waiting for evidence that the situation is worse now than it used to be. It is the old case of political amnesia. The Liberals have been in opposition for long enough to say, `Well, if it has always been that way, it has always been at fault. This matter can also be looked at from a comparative point of view. If one compares the effort we put into the upkeep of the rolls in Australia to that of other countries, one will find that on the whole our rolls stand up very well to their standards, if not exceed them. But if the Opposition is seeking absolute perfection-that is, at any one time 10 million names and addresses recorded on a piece of paper are going to be accurate at every point-one would need to have a habitation review every week.There are, however, long term methods by which the rolls can be made a lot better. One way of doing this is by using on-line computers in electoral offices. I cannot say that that is going to happen next year. If the Opposition were in government it would not be able to fund such an undertaking. It takes time to introduce these sorts of things. But we might get a lot closer to achieving that aim by using such methods. After the last election only one year had elapsed-and in some cases a lot less than one year-from the previous habitation review. Maybe the answer for absolutely clean rolls is not just yearly habitation reviews. I will be interested to hear how one can absolutely ensure that every citizen changes his name on the roll prior to or after moving. It is very interesting how one can do this in our sort of society, in which we do not want a Big Brother approach. The problem can be solved by such an approach, but we have to measure that off against the worth of the other.I say this to Senator Short: I do not regard the current rolls as being perfect. I regard them as being satisfactory, the same as does Mr Hughes. But I would need some proof from the honourable senator that the maintenance of the rolls in their current state is worse than it has ever been. One of the things that have changed in the Electoral Commission is that the Commissions standards and measurements have improved enormously in the last 10 years. The criteria by which the Commission is judged a success is a constantly rising standard. A lot of issues would never have been considered in the past because measurement standards did not exist to establish whether there was a problem. So, in regard to the cleanliness of the roll, I do not accept the honourable senators proposition that the rolls are worse now than they used to be. I think that is nonsense.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
300,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",3127,"—I am sure that the Minister for Home Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) and I would both agree that it is very hard to get hard evidence to support the anecdotal. This has always been the case and it always will be. All I can say is that now a far greater number of people, including divisional returning officers, come to me and say that the rolls are in more disarray than was the case in the past. I think that comes down to a question of where the Government places its priorities so far as expenditure in areas under its responsibility is concerned.Let me pick up one other point in relation to this matter. Although this is a somewhat different point, it stems from something which the Minister just said. Before I do that, I point out that I am not saying that habitation reviews are the be-all and end-all. I am at least as concerned with people who are on the roll as those who perhaps should not be on it. In that context, I am greatly concerned that there can be an enormous influx of people onto the electoral rolls a couple of weeks before the rolls close prior to a general election. As we both know, none of those entries or applications is checked. I think that is a matter of very real concern. I do not know what the answer is; I do not have a ready answer. But it is something that we both ought to be looking at.The Minister mentioned on-line computer facilities. I would like to raise with the Minister briefly a question which is under review at the moment by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and also, therefore, I assume, within the Government, perhaps one step further down the road, and that is the question of regionalisation of divisional returning officers. The proposal to group together the divisional returning officer and to regionalise the system was in the report that was commissioned by the Electoral Commissioner and carried out by Ms Diane Saunders. That report recommended that if there were regionalisation, it would be worthwhile only if there were appropriate expenditure on computer facilities in the regionalised offices. Will the Government guarantee that funds for such computer facilities would be available in the event of the Government deciding to go down the regionalisation route?","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[31]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

303,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3127,"—I might deal with that matter first. The reason we get a lot of people coming on to the rolls just before an election is that publicity has crystallised it in their minds. We really have to add up whether it is worse to announce an election, as happened in 1983, and close the rolls 24 hours later, catching all those people who say, `I will do it next week and then do not get a chance to do it. I do not think, per se, that the rush of people on to the rolls is wrong. However, there are a couple of aspects to that.Most of the people can be checked in one way or another in as much as they may have been on a previous roll. However, in future some resources should be made available to make sure that the roll is not being stacked. I defy the honourable senator to find anywhere in Australia so far where the roll has been stacked; it has not. However, the more often we talk about such things the more likely they are to occur, and not necessarily by an organised political force. Most organised political forces-Labor, Liberal and National-are too smart to try to stack a roll because they know they will be caught and will be taken to a court of disputed returns. The party which is caught will also have to pay costs. But some resources can be made available to do a spot check, especially on new enrollees; that is, those people on the roll for the first time.There have been a couple of cases where as an exercise a 16-year-old has enrolled and got a vote-there is no question of that. It is a user-friendly system and is always vulnerable to such things. But some checks will have to be run in future. I am quite happy to see some extra resources put into that area to check. If extra person-hours need to be put in, that is a worthwhile project. So on that point I share Senator Shorts concern and believe that that, at least will give us an idea. Most of the people get caught at some stage. One thing that concerns me is journalists putting up people to do this, as a trial run. I do not think that is justifiable in a democracy. An Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporter did it in the last election. He put up some 16-year-old who I think we are now prosecuting. The reporter suggested he falsify his enrolment card. That sort of thing is wrong. If we want a user-friendly system on electoral rolls and in an electoral sense, we have a good system at the moment. If it is perverted in such a manner as I have described we then have to go to draconian measures, be it an identity card or something else. I am sure that none of us in this chamber want to move into that area. Or we could go to the African position where people are stamped after they vote. Of course, we all know that Coca Cola takes the stamp off in five seconds flat. On that matter I share the honourable senators concern. Let us monitor progress.Senator Short asked me about regionalisation. I am a little hesitant about that. I usually wait for the all-powerful, influential and otherwise very good Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to report to me. I do not think that the matter is predicated only, from reading the report and from my knowledge of it, on computerisation. Getting some intermediate promotion levels in the Electoral Commission will be very good because sometimes there is too big a gap between the divisional returning offices and head office. There is a sort of central versus the sticks approach that develops in a bureaucracy, which is never very helpful. I look forward to the report with a totally open mind-I assure the honourable senator of that-on the value of regionalisation and, if regionalisation is not an option, maybe the grouping of officers or whatever else the Committee comes up with.I understand that coalition members have indicated that they have caucused against regionalisation. I think that they have probably done so for political reasons and I think that they are quite noble political reasons. I am not sure what the Labor members of the Committee and the others are inclined to do. I look forward to a quick report and a quick response on that. I do not think it is just predicated on computerisation or regionalisation. That was stressed in the report. I have not read all the evidence that has been put before someone such as Senator Short. I hope to when the final Hansards come out, but I do not think it has to be predicated absolutely on computerisation.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[32]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

314,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3129,"—I want to raise a few very brief matters that have arisen out of answers to Senate Estimates Committee questions. The first one relates to the new Commonwealth Government Centre in Wollongong which was banned by public servants. They refused to move into it for more than a month because no car parking spaces were provided, there was not an adequate security guard and they required a 40-place free child minding centre. I asked the Department in the Senate Estimates Committee hearing what would have been the cost of providing these facilities. The total cost was $500,000 a year made up in part of $100,000, provided there was only a 20-person work-related child-care centre rather than the 40-place one that was sought. That $100,000 simply related to the cost of administering rather than any capital cost of providing facilities. There was a $250,000 cost in providing paid car parking for 120 people, and the full time security guard requested would have required something like $50,000. As I said, it involved around half a million dollars a year. Had the demands of the unions been fully met it would have involved another $100,000, giving a total of about $600,000 a year.The point made in response to this was that the cost would multiply many times over if the Department were to agree to provide these facilities in Wollongong and they became standard in all other Commonwealth work places. The reason that is significant is that, as I understand it, these matters are now before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It seems to me that unless the Commonwealth is successful-I assume the Commonwealth is opposing these requests, and I ask the Minister where it is-there will be an enormous additional increase in the cost of providing facilities for public servants along these lines. I really wonder whether the Government is committed to opposing them in the terms that I think Mr West used in Wollongong recently, when he said it is wrong for one group of employees to make demands for something nobody else has. I seek an assurance that the Government will be vigorously opposing that kind of request in view of the enormous cost.The next matter I want to raise also relates to Wollongong. I have already raised in the chamber the extraordinary situation where the Department of Social Security leased for 36 months a property that it occupied for 16 months. The rest of the time it was being fitted out or there was a dispute over asbestos, or it was just empty. The reason I raise this again is that I asked a question of both the Department of Social Security and the Department of Administrative Services on this issue, and naturally they gave me totally different answers. I would like the Minister, if he could, to let me know who was giving me the accurate response. Was it the Department of Social Security or the Department of Administrative Services? Social Security said:A total amount of $446,000 rental was paid before the accommodation was occupied-that was for something like 20 months; it was then occupied for only 16 months-Payment of rental commenced on 13 May 1985. The original lease was for a period of 3 years from 13 May 1985 . . .It then went on to say that the fitout cost of the Wollongong regional office was $298,000. So we have there two figures: $446,000 for dead rent and $298,000 for fitout, a total of $744,000-three-quarters of a million dollars on fitting out or dead rent on a property that was occupied for all of 16 months. It is an absolutely ludicrous situation. It is even more ridiculous because in response to the same question the Department of Administrative Services said that rent for the fitout period was $339,000, not $446,000, and the cost for the fitout of the premises was $313,500, not $298,00. In other words, the Administrative Services figures add up to about $653,251 and the Department of Social Security figures add up to $744,000. These figures are in the same ballpark; the cost of dead rent and fitout was obviously between two-thirds of a million dollars and three-quarters of a million dollars. It would just be nice when one asks departments questions if they could give us the right answer, or at least an answer they agree on. If the Minister could help me in that area I would be most grateful. It would be nice to get the right figure on the record.The other point I want to make relates to a question raised already by Senator Panizza-that is, the remarkable differences in the cost of fitting out senators and members electorate offices. The point was very strongly and well made by Senator Newman that the average fitout cost for the offices of Opposition members was about half that of Government members. That is not simply in the ultimate cost involved; it also relates to the sorts of estimates made beforehand. In other words, there was a provision along those lines building in that kind of bias. I do not know whether it is true that, as this would suggest, Government members have a higher expectation-and have that expectation met-of better quality or more costly fitouts.When the Minister responded to Senator Newman he had no effective answer to the point she made. I wonder whether he has one now, particularly in the context that Senator Newman had removed from the figures those of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The difference cannot be explained, as I thought it may have been, by the fact that perhaps some Labor members are in the central built up areas of cities and therefore their costs are a lot dearer. That does not seem to be the case. For example, the fitout costs of Senator Devereux were $65,800 and $13,450 for furniture, giving a total of about $80,000. That compares with the cost of, say, Mr Kerr, a Labor member in the centre of Hobart, as I understand it, with a fitout cost of about $49,000 and $8,000 on furniture. Coalition members seem to have a lot lower cost. I have already pointed out that when I moved my office in Wollongong the total fitout cost was $4,300 and $1,133 was spent on furniture, because I was determined that the cost to the Government of that move would be as little as possible.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[35]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

317,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3129,"—Senator Ray is going to give me a thump over the ear about that soon. However, it seems to me that these differences require some explanation. They do not appear to relate to the area in which the offices are located. I also would like to raise the question of matters being kept from us on the basis of commercial-in-confidence. For example, we are not told what the rental costs of electorate offices are: we are given a range. In the latest year, the lowest rental cost is $44.98 per square metre, rising to a highest figure of $405 per square metre per annum. I do not know how $405 per square metre per annum compares with central business district prices. It seems an awful lot to me. Maybe the Minister can give an indication or whether that is reasonable in the circumstances. Perhaps the Department should let members and senators know the cost consequences of their decisions in determining where abouts they should set up their offices. At least then members of parliament could take a view that they might like to do what they can to save some money.This leads me to another matter: I am interested to note that the National Crime Authority responded to my request about dead rent by saying that its rental arrangements, as I recall it, are commercial-in-confidence. I wonder whether the Department of Administrative Services regards that as an acceptable answer. The National Crime Authority may well like to keep most things close to its chest, but I wonder whether there is any merit in the proposition that its rent is really commercial-in-confidence. I would have thought that any public authority paying rent should be answerable to this chamber.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[35]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I am informed that the Department of Industrial Relations will be opposing those claims in the Commission. I do not have any further information on that.I would like to make a possible correction to something I said earlier in answer to Senator Shorts question on the extent to which the Australian Electoral Commission was consulted on the Australian Capital Territory electoral system. I got a message this morning to say that the Commission has not been consulted, and I am now informed that it may have been. I will have to qualify that answer and get an accurate answer. I have been in this chamber a fair while today, what with the censure motion and other things, so I have not had a chance actually to ring and find out exactly what is going on from that end. I will qualify it now and say that I am in the twilight zone and I will seek to get an accurate answer as soon as possible on that one for the sake of the record, because I think people could draw the wrong conclusion about the Attorney-Generals Department, if in fact there was some discussion. It may fall into that technical area I described before, but it may have been more fulsome consultation than that message on my desk led me to believe.Senator Michael Baume raised the question of the National Crime Authority. I cannot help him very much with that. It is one of those sensitive areas and I am not sure whether the very sensitivity sometimes leads it to be overprotective.The question of office rents has been raised, and, of course, it is the old case of lies, lies, and more statistics. I think a whole range of measures have to be taken into account. Let me move to the first thing, fitout costs. Fitout costs do vary, so do rents, and their interrelationship varies. In some cases we have the choice of paying for the fit-out ourselves and having a lower rent, or allowing the owner to do the fitout himself and upping the rent. A classic case was Senator Schachts office. Let us move to Senator Baumes office, the miserable $4,000. The fitout cost was $20,000-not high, but it was $20,000; $4,000 is a little misleading. However, the cost to the Commonwealth was $4,000, because quite often we make other arrangements. Someone wanted to move Senator Baume, and move him quickly. When we moved him to new premises that person helped with the fitout costs. That is the normal sort of thing. Twenty thousand dollars is not a high figure and he should be commended on it.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[36]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I am saying that sometimes, in some of the lower fitout costs, there are hidden costs because the rent is higher. There is this interrelationship between the two. Take, for example, rent costs in Perth. The average rental cost for an Australian Labor Party (ALP) person in Perth is $120 per square metre per annum. The average cost for a Liberal Party person is $165 per metre per annum. The average Sydney rental between the ALP and the Liberals shows that the Liberal rent is higher by about $1,100; nothing dramatic, but sometimes it is reflected in those. I have taken the general policy in this regard that I think in the past members of parliament have been housed miserably. I am saying that I think they should be housed in a larger, a better equipped and a better style of office, and I do not apologise for that.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[36]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

But he knows that if he wishes to move out of the central business district we will be able to accommodate him elsewhere. I guess that is the price that he pays for being there, but at least he has a parking spot in that building, which is more than some of the more elevated members of the Parliament have. I would say this to Senator Baume and others: there is no carte blanche in terms of expenditure. I could table the letters from Liberal Party members demanding that I fit out an office and that the rent is $70,000 a year. I could easily do that if we wanted to square off the account, saying that I was being biased, et cetera, et cetera. I could go through all the files and show that some coalition members were greedier than, or as greedy, or however one likes to describe it, as ALP members. I do not wish to do that, but I do wish to say two things. There is no conscious effort on my part as a Minister to look after Labor people better than coalition members or Democrats and there is certainly no politicisation, as was raised here, of those matters. However, it all depends on what figures one uses. I could put the more accurate figures if Ministers were excluded. That would be fair because many offices are combined ministerial suites. Going through the figures, one sees that the average amount for Labor is $36,000 and the average for non-government is $27,000-not the $54,000 and $27,000 which we saw in Senator Newmans Press release. I am not saying that that is a wrong calculation; it is one perspective of the world, using one set of criteria. My calculation, by excluding the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Mr Beazley, comes up with figures that are nowhere near as dramatic.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[36]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

326,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3131,"—One-third worse. Honourable senators have had sent to them all the figures for various Liberals. The amount spent on Senator Bishop was $41,000 and for Mr Howard-he has another office, but for his electorate office-the amount was $47,000. And so it goes on. It is not unusual to see the figures for some coalition members being reasonably higher. I put it on the record here, and I agree, that some have been cheaper than Labor Party members. The amount for Senator Haines was $67,000. Honourable senators opposite are not saying that I have been biased towards Senator Haines, I hope, and have been trying to look after her. I draw the line at certain things.I suppose I could go through the figures in a detailed way. For instance, the question of Mrs Kellys furniture was raised. I was asked whether she got new furniture just because she moved. The reality is that she kept her old furniture a lot longer because she was moving. It would have been replaced in rotation much earlier had it not been known that she was moving. It was replaced on the basis of her move. In many of these cases one can very easily justify why X and Y cost a certain amount.I do not know that I want to add a lot more to what I have said in response to these questions. I think that I indicated to Senator Panizza earlier why the costs of Minister Beazleys office were reasonably large. Let me say in conclusion that these are just not surface figures; they include the rent paid. Quite often a fitout costs $60,000 and the rent $20,000 a year, or the fitout costs $10,000 and the rent goes to $30,000 a year. They are interrelated. If when the sun comes up tomorrow morning I have not convinced Opposition members and they have convinced every member on this side that I have run a biased policy in favour of their offices, I suppose it will not be the end of the world for me. I rather think that I would get a lot more support on this side of the chamber if that were actually thought, but I have to stand here and say that that is not the case. There is no deliberate bias towards Government members in this respect.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[36]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"
327,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3132,"—There are some problems with what Senator Ray has just said. For example, he said that my move cost $20,000. I would be grateful if he could itemise, or advise me, where my move cost 20 grand, and if he would adjust the complete table which we have here to take account of those hidden expenses so that we can judge properly what the expenses were. I have never until now heard any suggestion that my move, in terms of fitout, cost more than $4,300. I would be interested to know whether he is talking about the removal van expenses. As the Minister has said that my move cost $20,000, I ask him to provide comparable figures for everyone else.When I listened to the Ministers claim about the cost of fitting out new offices, I was intrigued that the average amount for Labor Party offices was $36,000, if Ministers offices were excluded. I have quickly run my eye over the figures and I find that that is absolutely impossible unless the Minister has done two things. Perhaps he has included Mr Snowdon on the list of people to divide the total by, when his expenses are listed as being in progress and there is no addition to the expense. Nevertheless, perhaps his name was put on the list. Or perhaps he has included Mr Lamb, whose fitout cost is nil, presumably because he was doing nothing more than getting some new furniture, just as Senator Austin Lewis had a nil fitout cost, but a furniture expense.There is no way, just eyeballing these totals, that the figure can possibly be as low as $36,000. It does not add up. If the Minister has a new, exciting way of adding up perhaps he could let me know. For example, the figure for Senator Colston is $53,000; for Mrs Darling, $50,800; for Ms Crawford, $34,500, and for Dr Charlesworth, $20,000-certainly well below the average. Senator Beahan is in there as nil. Maybe another nil has been included in the number of people to divide the total by. The average of $36,000 needs explanation.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[37]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
328,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Home Affairs)",3133,"—I did not introduce the question of Senator Baumes fitout in any way to embarrass Senator Baume. I just said that in that case that is why the figure of $4,000 is there, which was the all time stand-out figure. He was the grand finalist until then. In some cases there are hidden figures, but most of the hidden figures go the other way. They suppress the amount of fitout. In general that does not apply to the highest categories. As I say, in some cases in the higher categories we have gone to a full fitout without charging the owner on the basis of a long term drop in rent. That is just as justifiable as doing the reverse.On the question of averaging out, Mr Lamb, for instance, moved and did not have any fitout costs on that occasion. He is in the nether world of wondering whether he has to move again because, as honourable senators would realise, in certain electorates it is almost impossible to get accommodation. That is increasingly true in certain Sydney and Melbourne electorates, where it is almost impossible to get electorate offices near transport. On the question of how one averages it out, I guess, as I said, there are 100 different ways of averaging it out. My way of averaging it out is just as justifiable as Senator Newmans, which came out with double the amount rather than one-third extra.Proposed expenditure agreed to.GROUP FDepartment of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and TerritoriesN/AProposed expenditure, $16,854,000","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[38]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
329,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3133,"—I wish to raise a number of matters regarding the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in relation to the arts. I take as my starting point a couple of questions which I am sure Senator Richardson will be able to answer. Senator Richardson will recall that at an Estimates committee hearing he indicated to me that the so-called review of museums was just about complete and that the report was to go before Cabinet for consideration. Senator Richardson said, on 14 April, in relation to a question I asked about the consideration of the review of museums, `In all probability it will go before the Cabinet the week after next. We are now six weeks or so past that point. Therefore, I want to know from the Minister at what stage the final determination of the review of museums is.That leads me to discuss two questions arising from museums. The first is the continuing uncertainty which this Government is engendering in terms of the future of the Museum of Australia. There is already substantial public investment in the Museum of Australia. An important historical collection of artefacts is being held at the Museum. The Museum, to all intents and purposes, has been put into some sort of state of suspended animation. It has no resources for adding to its collection. It has no idea whether it will get additional support in order to complete its building program in whole or in part. It is the repository of a very valuable collection of Aboriginal artefacts which it inherited from the old Institute of Aboriginal Studies. These are not being displayed satisfactorily, as far as public observation is concerned.I believe that the Museum is being treated very shabbily by this Government. It is long past the stage of being a joke. The Museum is entitled to know whether the vendetta which has been run against museums by the Department of Finance will continue. We know that the preferred position of the Department of Finance is that the Museum should not go ahead and that its funding should be severely cut. It has that same view about the Australian National Film and Sound Archive, the Australian National Gallery, the Australian National Maritime Museum and the Australian War Memorial. I believe that the uncertainty needs to be put to rest. This review of museums has become a paralysis for Australias collecting institutions. It has become a paralysis for the development of museums, particularly national museums throughout Australia. I would be grateful for the Ministers advice on this matter.The next museum issue to which I turn is the scandalous behaviour of the Minister for the Arts and Territories, Mr Punch, in relation to the sacking of the Board of the National Maritime Museum. Let me recall precisely what happened on that occasion. The members of the interim Board of the Museum, in particular, the Chairman, Mr Dix, the Deputy Chairman, Rear-Admiral Robertson, and another member, Miss Kristine Klugman, were dismissed from their positions largely on the basis of a phone call from the Ministers office to Mr Dix informing him that he was not to continue as the Chairman of the Board of the Museum. The other members, Miss Klugman and Rear-Admiral Robertson, were dismissed by receiving a telephone call from a secretary in the Ministers office. This is the way in which people are dealt with by this Government. These people have given public service to be on the Board of the Museum and they are rung up by a secretary in the Ministers office and told that they are not to be on the Board any longer.I give another example of the Governments incompetence. We had introduced in this Parliament in April 1986 the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill. That Bill has still not been dealt with by this Parliament. It has still not been passed. We have had the expenditure on the famous, or infamous, brochure on the National Maritime Museum. Does the Minister remember this? Each copy, comprising the cover and a single piece of paper, cost $72. These were produced at $72 a throw so that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) could take one to the United States and present it to President Reagan as part of the process of asking for the Americans bicentennial gift to the National Maritime Museum. Those brochures were printed at $72 a throw, we have had an interim board, we have no legislation, the Board has been dismissed and now, Lord spare us, we have an invitation for a founding day program.This is a matter of some curiosity. We are to have a ceremony to mark not the founding of the museum but the anniversary of the founding of the museum. The invitation states that the ceremony is `to mark the anniversary of the founding of the museum. It still has no Act of Parliament to underpin it. It has no properly established governing authority in terms of parliamentary legislation, but here we have a nice little card, an invitation which says that Minister Richardson is, at 11.15 on Tuesday, 14 June, to introduce the new Chairman and members of the Museum Council. It is interesting that now, all of a sudden, it is the `Museum Council. Just a few weeks ago it was an interim council. It is not in fact a council because there is not a piece of legislation establishing it as such. Nevertheless, we have this piece of paper which says that we are going to have all sorts of ceremonies and that Mr Peter Doyle, who is the new Chairman of the Museum Council, will respond to the kind words that Senator Richardson will undoubtedly say about that. It is interesting to note that on the printed invitation are the words `interim council, but that on the piece of paper that goes with it from the museum itself it is not `interim, but the `museum council.We have had this whole saga in which people have been dismissed on the basis of a telephone call from a secretary. They do not even have the elementary and fundamental courtesy of being told by the Minister, by the Secretary to the Department or by some person in senior authority that they will be fired. We have a secretary of the Ministers office ringing distinguished people such as Rear Admiral Robertson and telling them that their services are being dispensed with. I find that extraordinarily unsatisfactory.The next point to which I wish to draw attention-and Senator Stone was good enough to remind me of this-is that a great deal of this arises from the activities of Mr Punch. Mr Punch is unable to devise an electoral system for the Australian Capital Territory which would otherwise fit in with the Governments referendum proposals. He is, however, sufficient of an expert to direct the Australian National Gallery as to what it should purchase and what it should not purchase. I believe that one of the things which has not been adequately explained and about which I look forward to an explanation from the Minister is the extent to which the Minister has issued other directions in terms of acquisitions of museum collections.Let me say quite clearly that I do not dispute-and I make this point abundantly clear for the Ministers benefit-the right of the Minister in charge of these institutions to give such a direction if in his judgment he believes that the Gallery should not spend $4m to acquire a Picasso. The legislation quite clearly gives him the right to issue such a direction. But when that direction is given, I believe, people are entitled to have a proper explanation as to what it is that the Minister has taken into his judgment. He knows full well that this is not the first government to make such a decision. Prime Minister Fraser in 1976 certainly made a similar ruling in terms of the potential acquisition of a Georges Braque painting. I do not dispute that. But I do dispute that these directions should be given without a proper and coherent explanation of the underpinning philosophy which the Minister is bringing to bear when he substitutes his own judgment for the judgment of the professional experts that he has advising him as far as the museum is concerned.I have a number of other things to say in relation to the Australia Council, and the Design Board in particular, and to the question of the decisions made in relation to the film industry. Having raised those three points, all of which deal with museums and collecting institutions, perhaps that would be an appropriate place to allow the Minister to make his reply.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[39]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

332,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator RICHARDSON","4E4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories)",3135,"—It has been lodged and it will be dealt with in the next couple of weeks. Obviously, I cannot answer questions that are contained within the review. So, I am not at liberty to answer questions on the Governments attitude towards the future of the National Museum of Australia. I cannot answer questions until the Government has dealt with the submission that the Minister for the Arts and Territories, Mr Punch, has lodged. I will be only too happy to inform the Senate as soon as the Government has made its decision.In respect of the sacking, as Senator Puplick refers to it, of the Board of the Australian National Maritime Museum, it should be noted, of course, that all we were dealing with was an interim council. We were not dealing with an exalted body with a higher status than that. It is simply not true to say that the only notification that the appointment of a number of people was to be ended came from some secretary in the Ministers office. The reality is that each person so affected was written to by the Minister. But because the Minister has a regard not only for the proper form of things but for manners to make sure that the right thing was done by the people concerned, he ensured that his Senior Private Secretary-not just some secretary, but his Senior Private Secretary-rang each person affected to ensure that they had some foreknowledge before they received a letter.Senator Puplick then raised a question about brochures costing $72 each. This matter is really getting very long in the tooth. This is a two-year-old argument which was brought before Estimates committees a long time ago. What he is really talking about are a number of brochures prepared for the Prime Ministers trip to the United States of America for the purpose of raising funds. Given that as a result of the Prime Ministers visit the United States Government saw fit to contribute some $US5m as its bicentennial gift, I would have thought that the cost of the magazines was pretty infinitesimal.When it comes to the argument of the Maritime Museum putting out a Press statement or an invitation-I am not sure which one Senator Puplick was referring to-which referred to me introducing the new interim council members as new council members, the Museum got it wrong. I think I might ring the Museum tomorrow and tell it that it got it wrong. However, I do not think it is a hanging offence, nor will I waste a great deal of my time on it. Rather, when I talk to the Museum tomorrow, I will talk about the exciting future that it has.The last point raised by Senator Puplick concerns the intervention by Minister Punch to stop the purchase of the Picasso. `How dare he!, came the cry from the other side. The reality is, of course, that that is his job. Under the legislation which set up the National Gallery ministerial approval is required for any acquisition that is in excess of $450,000. That being the case, the Gallery quite rightly forwarded this request on to Minister Punch. Minister Punch has to take into account a number of factors. Obviously, the judgment of the council of the National Gallery is one of them. But in the present climate, economic restraint is certainly another. He also must take into account the role of the National Gallery, particularly during our bicentennial year.It is not the practice of Ministers to comment on the purchase price of these objects; but I can say, without putting a price on it, that that one Picasso would have cost more than the entire years acquisition budget for the National Gallery. I do not believe that the people of Australia, given all the sacrifices they have been asked to endure in the last few years, with the corner being turned, should now be faced with the prospect of a Minister approving a purchase that is absolutely massive. I would have thought that in Minister Punch making the decision he did, all he would have done was increase the confidence that people have in him and in the Government in which he serves.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[40]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
333,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3136,"—Some of the Ministers reply really beggars the imagination. Frankly, even for the Minister, it was a fairly tenuous argument to suggest that the American Governments decision as to what its bicentennial gift to the nation would be, given all the work of Ambassador Lane, all the visits by high-powered American congressional delegations and all the work put in my our Embassy in Washington, was influenced by taking over to President Reagan a four-piece scrap of paper and coming away with a cheque for $5m, or $7m, which is the ultimate price for the American gallery. It is also tenuous to suggest that President Reagan-with all that has been said about the gentlemans intellectual competence and all the other splendid attributes he has-would be so impressed by this tawdry piece of paper as to fork out $5m on behalf of the American Government, given that the commitment was made by the Americans before the Prime Ministers trip to Washington took place. So let us put to one side that absolute nonsense.The Minister goes on to say that I had said, `How dare Mr Punch intervene as far as the Picasso purchase is concerned. I understand, while the Minister is coy about such things, that the figure we are talking about is around $4m. I made it perfectly clear that I decided that it was the Ministers responsibility. What I said was that one was entitled to a better explanation. Perhaps the explanation is to be found in Robert Haupts article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 18 May 1988 entitled `Of art and philistinism. Referring to Mr Punch, he states:He has also failed to learn that great art is always preposterous from the political standpoint. No-one who adheres to a political orthodoxy (Mr Punch is an adherent of the NSW Labor Party Right) can easily comprehend something as revolutionary as Cubism. Stalin never got to grips with it, and one feels that Graham Richardson is only pretending to understand.I think the Ministers explanation tonight simply indicates the extent to which Mr Haupt is not only a good political correspondent but an extremely perceptive art critic as well. The final point, telling us that the purchase of the Picasso for $4m cannot go ahead because this is a time of economic restraint-with a Budget that provides $35m for a series of referendum proposals, after we have spent $6m for a Constitutional Commission and not even waited for its report, then to find that the Government cannot even get right the questions it is going to put forward in the $35m referendum-really is stretching matters a fair way.So let us go instead to another of Mr Punchs enormous successes; that is, winding up the Designs Board of the Australia Council. We know from discussions which have taken place that, just like the electoral system for the Australian Capital Territory, it was not quite meant to happen this way. We know from the discussions which took place between Mr Andrews and Senator Button and, indeed, the discussions which took place between Mr Andrews and Senator Richardson, which Senator Richardson confirmed the other day, that Mr Andrews was advised that no further decisions would be taken without consultation. Senator Button had indicated his very strong support for the Designs Board which is a small but very important part of the Australia Council-because it deals with the issues of industrial design and training of designers and has a real economic benefit back to the community.All of a sudden Mr Punch has determined that the Designs Board will be wound up as from 1 July 1988. We know that Senator Button is pretty ropeable about all of this. We know that Senator Richardson is obligated to defend both his junior Minister and his factional colleague in this particular matter, but the destruction of the Designs Board of the Australia Council and its replacement with two committees, neither of which in their new form will be adequate to do the job, I think is an absolute disgrace. The issue of the Bulletin of 31 May 1988 records:Just as the importance of design is being recognised in cultural and commercial sectors of Australian society, Gary Punch, the junior Minister with responsibility for the federal Arts portfolio, has pulled the rug from under the design community. It seems that the battle to squeeze the Design Board out of the Australia Council is all but over.Urged on by council chairman Professor Donald Horne, Punch has countermanded decisions made by his boss, Senator Graham Richardson, and incurred the displeasure of Industry Minister John Button.We know Mr Cohen refused Professor Hornes demands for widening the Designs Board, and rightly so. We know that Professor Horne has some very eclectic views about the operations of the Australia Council. In a speech which he gave as the inaugural lecture for the Institute for Cultural Policy Studies at Griffith University on 7 October 1987, Professor Horne stated:The Australia Council can sometimes look a power-hungry character. So let me say, first, that there are some things I would like the Australia Council to get rid of so that it might concentrate entirely on new arts, innovative arts. Under those circumstances, it would seem to be a bit funny not having experimental film.He went on to make another couple of comments. We have seen that he has managed to achieve getting rid of the Designs Board which is of great importance and ought to be preserved, but he has not been successful in continuing his association with what he called experimental film because the Australia Council Amendment Act, which is currently before the House of Representatives and which we will not debate until the next session, specifically removes film from the definition of art under the Australia Council legislation. So we find that what Professor Horne was really on about and what he has persuaded Mr Punch to be on about was getting rid of that part of the Australia Councils operations which had a real and significant economic impact on the way in which design, the promotion of design, the study of design and the effective use of design in productive industry in Australia could be advanced. This is simply yet another indication of the incapacity of the Government actually to manage as far as the arts community is concerned.I am going to make some final remarks in terms of asking the Minister some questions in relation to the new plan for the film industry. As I understand it, the $70m allocated towards the film industry requires that within the overall-I stress that-that $70m is somehow dependent upon attracting a 30 per cent participation in the overall scheme from private sector funding. In other words, for the whole of the $70m to be expended, in the overall there is a requirement that there be some 30 per cent, some $21m, raised within the private sector. What I want the Minister to address his mind to in relation to this matter is the extent to which that is required on a project by project basis. In other words, is it the Governments intention to have some films funded in a way which will in fact allow 100 per cent allocation of funds from the Film Finance Corporation so that at the beginning of each year, for example, it will be possible for a group with a project, without any indication that it has available to it private sector finance, to get substantially more than a 70 per cent component from the Corporation? If that is the case it will have implications for the amount of money that can be raised by those who come later in the year, later in the queue, because the overall expenditure of $70m requires that 30 per cent commitment by the private sector before it is all fundamentally put together.The last point I raise with the Minister is what representations, if any, he has made to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) or to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) regarding the two sales tax rulings-sales tax ruling No. 2407 on video production, and the other ruling on sound recordings-which relate to the imposition of the additional 20 per cent sales tax on production and post-production costs in certain video and sound recordings. I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate what representations he has made or what the current thinking of the Government is on that matter.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[41]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator Baume and I have at last found something in common-after only five years here together. It is pathetic if Senator Puplick does not know that the Design Board is not the Designs Board. Senator Puplick has created an impression by reading some articles from the newspapers. Just as I would not accept some of the articles that I have seen in the papers of recent times about Senator Puplick, I am sure he would not believe everything he reads in the papers either. We are told in some article that Gary Punch has incurred my displeasure and the displeasure of Senator Button, and in fact countermanded our instructions. Nothing could be further from the truth.As I said in an answer I gave in this place a couple of weeks ago on the Design Board, the Government always had as its base line the maintenance of a design function. The argument was always about where this would best be located. Of course that is a complex argument and the reason there were discussions between Senator Button and me on this issue was that we had to work out whether design, much of which is industrial design, was best located within the portfolio administered by Senator Button or within the arts portfolio with the Australia Council. As a result of those discussions it was determined that it would be best if the design function were maintained within the Australia Council. That being the case, there have been extensive consultations with representatives of the Design Board and the Australia Council on an appropriate future for the Design Board.As a consequence of that the Chairman of the Australia Council, Donald Horne, together with the former Chairman of the Design Board, Mr Andrews, will be presenting to the Australia Council in the next couple of days a joint proposal for the future functions of the Design Board. As I pointed out in the Senate a couple of weeks ago, I believe that the direction in which this matter is heading is towards the formation of a committee within the Australia Council to deal with the design function. Hopefully that matter will be resolved by the Australia Council in the next few days. Remember that it has to be resolved by the Australia Council because, contrary to what Senator Puplick said, the Minister does not have the power to direct the Australia Council to abolish the Design Board. It has to be a decision taken by the Australia Council itself. Naturally, in an issue of this kind, the Minister is entitled to put his views, and properly put them; and he did so. But it is going to be, in the end, a decision for the Australia Council. Certainly, Senator Button and I are not upset at the outcome of the discussions.I was asked about the film industry. We are talking about this magic figure of 30 per cent. That is a goal that we would hope we can achieve on every occasion. If we cannot, of course, the reality is that we would look to significant private funding. That will be the benchmark for the new Film Corporation to look to. If we are talking about significant private funding, no film will be 100 per cent funded by the Australian Film Corporation. I think I can put Senator Puplicks mind at rest on that.In terms of the representations that we have made to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on the question of the sales tax rulings, which were also I think the subject of a question here some time back, the status quo is remaining while the situation is sorted out.

I read from Mr Punchs letter addressed to Professor Horne and dated 31 March 1988:In view of this and the need to resolve the matter before the beginning of the next financial year, I propose to revoke the establishment of the Design Board under Section 20 of the Australia Council Act with effect from 1 July 1988.That is not a determination of the Australia Council; that is a letter from the Minister addressed to Professor Horne in which he says, as Minister, `I propose to revoke the establishment of the Design Board under Section 20 of the Australia Council Act. For the Minister to say in the cut and thrust that it is not a decision ultimately made by the Minister but is a decision of the Australia Council is not to deal fairly with this chamber in terms of answering questions in the Estimates debate.I am still anxious to clarify what it is that will technically or legally prevent the Film Finance Corporation from deciding to invest 100 per cent of the cost of making a film. As I understand the purport of the May statement-and there is no legislation, as I understand, which is necessary to give effect to the arrangement-what was announced was that there would be a Film Finance Corporation; that it would have an allocation in this first year of $70m; and that it would be expected that `overall-and that is the word I think used in the May statement and in the supporting papers-it would be required to attract a 30 per cent investment from the private sector.The Minister said that there was no magic figure of 30 per cent to achieve on every occasion but then went on to say that there would be no films in which the Finance Corporation would invest 100 per cent. Can he indicate whether that is to be by way of ministerial direction to the Film Finance Corporation or whether there will be some legislative underpinning of that? It is clear that none of the statements that have been put out on this package make that determination clear. I am anxious to understand that, particularly in relation to the questions which will arise if we get to debate the amendments to the Australian Film Commission Act which will have a bearing, in terms of the Oppositions view on that matter, as to the operations of the Film Finance Corporation.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[43]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The sooner we can get on with our business, the sooner we can debate it, and I am anxious to do so. I take the second part of his question first, that is, who will determine how much is going to be required from the private sector in the funding of any film. The new corporation or company that is set up will decide this. It is not a case of ministerial direction, although I can only repeat that it is not the case that we would be permitting a figure of nought, because that obviously does not amount to significant private funding. Just where the figure will come down, we will have to wait and see when we have set up the new company and it has made its decisions.On the question of the Design Board, it is obvious that the Minister will not take action without the advice of the Australia Council. He will be receiving that advice in the next few days, and I am only too glad that it is finally getting around to giving us that result. It has taken a long time, a lot of discussion, and a great deal of consultation, and it was indeed the consultation that the honourable senator was querying in the first place.

We are paying goodness knows how much not to have a gold tax during the course of this Parliament because we gave a commitment that we would not. We have to weigh up with Senator Richardson and the Government whether, in fact, the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests is in the same category as the gold tax or whether it is in the same category as the capital gains tax. That is to say, there has been an intervening election somewhere along the line and, as a result, everything said before an election, unless it is repeated after an election, cannot possibly be regarded as binding on the same Prime Minister and the same Government that gave the commitment to begin with.The Acts Interpretation Act provides, and this Parliament has provided, that in working out what an Act of parliament means the court shall have regard to a second reading debate because that is a complete interpretation of what the Government intends the Act to do or to achieve. The Act was intended-and let us leave Mr Cohen out of it for a moment-by the Hawke Labor Government to be the method by which the dispute over the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests of Tasmania was to be resolved. It was not simply to add to the mishmash of information, but to resolve the dispute. Mr Cohen said, when he introduced the legislation, that this was an inquiry to resolve difficult questions. It was going to resolve them on the basis of all of this expertise and expert evidence on which this $2.18m has now been expended, and on the basis of accepting the inquirys findings.I do not intend to allow myself to be distracted by the nevertheless attractive Senator Haines waving her flower around on this occasion-as distinct from her usual practice of sitting with it in her teeth-in order to draw attention to herself, because the issue is an extremely important one. The position has been put to us by Senator Richardson. Now that the tired and emotional Australian Democrats have withdrawn, I presume that we can continue with the point of substance, which is the commitment given by the Hawke Labor Government, when the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests (Commission of Inquiry) Act passed through this Parliament, that it would be bound by the inquirys findings. Mr Cohen did not say, `I will accept the inquirys findings; he said, `We will accept the inquirys findings. He was speaking on behalf of the Hawke Labor Government.Senator Richardson is now saying that the Hawke Labor Government will not be bound by the promise and commitment which it gave on 18 March 1987 when it passed this legislation. I understand entirely what Senator Richardson is saying. I understand entirely the decision which Senator Richardson has made in terms of this particular matter-that he will not be bound by the inquiry. I want to make it abundantly clear on the record that this is a total repudiation of the commitment and undertaking given by the Government when the Helsham inquiry legislation was brought before the Parliament for its initial passage.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[61]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

409,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PARER","KI4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",3144,"—I will come to that. Let us put the matter into perspective. There are various ways of generating electricity. One is by oil and gas. To use oil-and a fair bit of oil is used for generating electricity-is equivalent to throwing mahogany into the fireplace. We are aware that there is going to be a shortage of liquid fuels. They must be conserved for their unique uses-to fuel Senator Sanderss 1972 Toyota, unless he goes back to the Flintstone days and pedals it. Hydro-power is another method of generating electricity but the sources for that are limited. This Government stopped the use of hydro-power in Tasmania-a very cheap way of generating electricity. We have renewable resources and efforts are going on in various areas to promote them. I suppose that some time down the track they will be commercially viable.Then we have coal, which is a major export from Australia. It has two uses: firstly, it is used for the generation of electricity and, secondly, it is used in the production of steel. To actually burn coking coal in a power station is again equivalent to wasting a very scarce resource. The only major use of uranium is to generate electricity. We must bear in mind that we have a balance of payments problem in this country. Almost month by month our balance of payments deficit runs at something like $1 billion, so over a year we increase our foreign balance of payments deficit by something in the order of $11 billion. We are fortunate in this country to be fairly rich in resources, but in some areas we have missed the boat. For example, our iron ore and steel industries are very important to Australia and to our balance of payments and yet we missed out on the opportunity to get into major steel mills, the jumbo mills, as described in the mid-1970s. We nearly missed the boat on bauxite and its conversion to aluminium through the smelters. In fact, the Australian Labor Party, the Government of Victoria and the militant trade unions went around the countryside-I suppose Senator Sanders and his group were doing the same thing-saying, `Stop what is going on in Victoria. We are exporting canned electricity. They nearly got away with it at enormous cost to the people of Australia and to the people of Victoria. Thank God they did not because it is a resource to which we have put enormous value added.Now we come to the last great resource that we have in this country, which is uranium. As I mentioned earlier, uranium is a valuable energy producing resource. The controlled heat generated from the chain reaction is used to convert water to steam which, in turn, spins turbines and produces electricity. That is the use of Australian uranium. Every sane person on the other side of the chamber knows that. Yet where do we stand? I would like to get the Governments view and the Ministers view on this. Recently Senator Button directed that a paper be prepared. It recommends that Australia should allow additional exports to meet the growing market demand-and it is a growing market demand. Honourable senators should bear in mind that we have something like three times the uranium resources of Canada and twice the resources of South Africa and yet the Canadians produce three times as much uranium as we do in Australia. What stupidity this is with our balance of payments position the way it is. Everyone knows that to get this country back on track we must either export more or improve our import replacement position, thus importing less.The question I want to ask is: Where do we stand? Australia is in chaos; it is in a mess. I asked Senator Cook a number of questions in recent times. I said, `What are you going to do? Are you going to stick to this ludicrous three mines policy? Are you going to get into uranium enrichment? Anyone who has done an estimate on these figures will know that if we do not we are going to forfeit an estimated $1 billion a year. Honourable senators should bear in mind that if we do get into uranium enrichment we have a better control on the end product-I am sure that will please Senator Sanders-but it will also add something in the order of $1 billion to our exports.As I said, Senator Button had a paper prepared. The recommendation, as I understand it, was to meet the growing market demand and was that preference should be given to new operators prepared to work towards adding maximum value to the ore. What he means by that is: Let us get into uranium enrichment, let us get into the value added. Let me tell the Minister that if we do not do that the uranium enrichment industries in countries overseas will become so entrenched that it will be too late and yet again we will have missed the bus.The question I am asking is: Where on earth do we stand? Senator Richardson, the Minister at the table, belongs to the Right. I understand from reports that the Right supports the removal of the silly three-mine policy and that it supports, sensibly, the value added principle. We have also Senator Cook, a Western Australian member of the Centre Left faction, formerly a strong opponent of uranium mining. He is like Senator Richardson. He is a born-again; he is having second thoughts. The trouble with Senator Cook is that he has loyalties to the people who put him in as a Minister. So he is in a difficult position.We have Senator Collins, a very sensible senator from the Northern Territory who has strongly put the same point of view-not the insane Left view, not the insanities of the Nuclear Disarmament Party or the insanities of Senator Sanders. He recognises the facts. Also he is representing his own constituency, which includes members of the Koongarra Aboriginal community, who I understand are going down to the Australian Labor Party National Conference in Tasmania to argue this very point: Why is the Government doing this Aboriginal community out of the opportunity to earn some money for its tribal people? It is a good question. Mr Hogg says, `Lets cool it, lets not make a decision; it is too hard. We have to make a decision because, as I said, if we do not do so now it will be too late.I understand the National President of the Labor Party, Mr Bannon, has said today that he supports three mines. Of course he does. He has one in South Australia. Senator Collins does not have the extra one he wants in the Northern Territory. Mr Hogg is blaming a wealthy lobby group for the push to change the policy. But that is an easy way out, a cop-out. We are looking for hard decisions. The Centre Left is now split on the uranium issue. Senator Cook has been born again. He now understands the importance of his ministerial position. His colleague Mr Gordon Bilney has come out with a paper saying the policy should be opened up. We do now know where we are, and hence I ask the Minister where the Government stands on this issue. Is it going to make a decision, or is it going to procrastinate for such a length of time that when a decision is made it will be too late?","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[71]/talk.start[6]/para","N/A","N/A"

As has been ably pointed out by my colleague Senator Parer, we stand on different sides in this matter. Basically Senator Parer was using the dope pusher argument, that we should sell something overseas to make money. We could push heroin and make a lot of money. We could really do a lot of good with our heroin. If Senator Parer is interested only in money, we could push not only heroin but also cocaine and crack. We could push a whole lot of things which would not be as dangerous as uranium, because of course uranium will pollute and poison this earth for 250,000 years. The troglodytes on my right feel that that is nothing to worry about. They just want to make a quick buck for their friends, their cronies and their masters in the multinationals-a quick buck in the next half hour, half year or 10 years or whatever. They do not care about the future; they do not care about what the kids will have to put up with. They do not care at all.

431,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",3147,"—It is easy to see what sort of results we get in debates when people have a distilled dinner. The Australian Democrats have a very fanciful set of policies relating to uranium. Whilst we may certainly call into question many of the actions that the Government has taken in some areas, at least it does not fall into the trap of thinking that because it represents a very small sector of the Australian community it has the right to preach a gospel claiming it has all the wisdom in this area. What Senator Sanders conveniently forgets in all of his debate is that energy is the driving force of where we are and what it is all about, and the future generations will not be able to exist without the generation of power that will be so very necessary from uranium and from the full nuclear cycle.In addressing the appropriations that are before us today I would like to pose a number of questions to the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), particularly relating to the operations of the Office of the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region and the implications that come in that area with regard to uranium development at this time. The Minister has to accept that he holds a very onerous responsibility in looking at the future of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. He would be well aware that in February and March the Shadow Minister for science, Mr Warwick Smith, and Mr Ian Wilson MP, in the House of Representatives, Senator Austin Lewis and I in this place, and in more recent days the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy, Barry Coulter, have all raised the prospect of transferring the functions of the Office of the Supervising Scientist to the University College of the Northern Territory. I believe Mr Coulter has been encouraged in discussions with Ministers of the Labor Government, including the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), that this is an appropriate matter to be considered. I would like to solicit this evening the Ministers views in this regard, as to where he sees the future function of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Is it in the Northern Territory, or is it to remain attached to Bondi, where in my argument it is inappropriate for ensuring that this matter is looked at and the monitoring functions being properly carried out? There are many issues to support the argument as to why the monitoring function should be very properly done in the Northern Territory, either by the Department of Mines or, for those research and very important functions, by the very new but exciting University College of the Northern Territory. I would be very pleased to hear the Ministers views in this regard.The other area I would like the Minister to address very particularly is the consultation process that is going on with the Aboriginal people who are vitally affected with the uranium development in the mining province. I think it was Senator Parer who said earlier this evening that he is aware-and I know this also from discussions I have had with Senator Collins-that there will be a number of people from the Gagadju Association and from the East Alligator Rivers region here this week. Does the Minister agree with the statements by the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Hogg, that these Aboriginal people are merely being used as tools for people whom they have employed? I find that a disgraceful assertion by someone who holds such high office within the Labor Party and who is seeking to influence the debate on major uranium issues for the forthcoming Conference of the Labor Party to be held in Hobart in a week or so.The Northern Territory has already lost millions of dollars as a result of Labors stubbornness on uranium mining. The decisions of the last six years have cost the community throughout Australia many millions of dollars. We have heard in recent days from Mr Bilney in the other place, from Senator Collins and Senator Aulich in here, and from a number of people who are taking a practical approach to this problem. They recognise it is appropriate and it is timely to change the Governments policies in this area. Does the Minister at the table agree with the necessity to move away from the restrictive and confining policies in which we have been bound up for the past few years? I ask the Minister: What would be the particular benefits to the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Territory Government and to the Aboriginal people of the East Alligator Rivers area if the Koongarra and Jabiluka mines were to be opened up? Has the Government had available to it in recent times economic reports that have carefully looked at these issues? Has the Hawke Government reached any recent decisions on the important future financing of our community and the benefits that would flow?I am aware, from figures that have been floating around in the media, that the Koongarra project would produce some $2 billion in export earnings over the next 10 years and some $256m in royalties and participation to the Aboriginal communities through job creation. Senator Sanders continually seems to put aside the fact that jobs are important. Some 2,300 man years of direct employment would flow from the Koongarra project. The uranium oxide from Koongarra is already available for sale through Denison Australia Pty Ltd. It is available not to France, but to Japan and Canada. What is the important implication of that for Australia? I believe that the negotiated sale price is well above the current standard floor price. It is important to recognise that benefits would flow to the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area and, of course, to government revenues and the economy, through the involvement of the community.What are the costs of the Labor Partys current policy? I ask the Minister to tell us what detailed studies have been undertaken recently by his Department. What studies have been undertaken by the Office of the Supervising Scientist of the environmental impact on the area? What studies have been undertaken recently by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service? I believe that on environmental issues the present Ranger and Nabarlek mines can stand well and truly on their record. They can stand proud. I want to know what recent studies the Government has had available to it.In two weeks time the Labor Party will be challenged to open up in many areas and it will have to look very carefully at its policies. Whilst I named Mr Campbell, Mr Bilney, Senator Collins, Senator Aulich and others who have had the courage to say where they stand on this issue, I am extremely disappointed that the two Northern Territory delegates to the Labor Party Conference do not have the guts to stand up and say exactly how they will vote on this issue. Mr John Waters is a leftie who is well and truly identified. I have no doubt that he will be bound and towed into his faction. But the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, Mr Terry Smith, has equivocated all over the place. He cannot make up his mind. He cannot decide where to go, like so many others in the Labor Party. On a radio talkback program in Darwin this morning, Terry Smith said:Im going to be going down there and putting forward the best possible case for the Territory . . . going to be involved in all the negotiations and discussions going on, going to get the best deal for the Territory with all the negotiations at the Conference.Later he said:. . . want to be an important piece of those discussions . . . Im on the inside, Im, working within the Party at this stage, its a very sensitive issue within the Labor Party.However, Terry Smith does not have the courage, like so many members of the Labor Party, to take a stance and say where the Territorys interests are. What are the Territorys interests? We all know where Senator Collins stands on this issue. He issued one of the best ever technical policy statements; it was a background paper on uranium--","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[73]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

436,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COLLINS","OF4","(Northern Territory)","ALP","N/A",3149,"—Perhaps the National Secretary would have preferred that I had finished my speech. The National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Bob Hogg, went on the National Nine television channel tonight and spoke about a group of my constituents, my Aboriginal constituents, who are coming to Canberra on Wednesday, as constituents of all races and creeds in this democratic country of ours do, to make representations to their government about something that they want very much. I have known those constituents of mine for 20 years. I represented them in the Northern Territory Parliament for 10 years. On more occasions than I can remember over those 10 years-hundreds of occasions-when I visited them in their homes in Kakadu National Park I received representations from them relating to uranium mining.The National Secretary of the Labor Party, to my great regret, said on national television tonight that the Aboriginal people who are coming down here on Wednesday had employed a professional journalist as a consultant, as a lobbyist if you like, to represent them, that that action therefore demonstrated that they did not know their own minds on this issue, and that they did not really want uranium mining because-I quote him-they were simply `being manipulated by the people they were employing.Bob Hogg, to my certain knowledge, has never met my constituents, the owners of the Koongarra uranium mine. In order to correct the public record on behalf of my constituents, who have been publicly vilified and slurred on national television tonight by the National Secretary of the Labor Party, I want to put this on the record: I was elected in 1977 by those people to fight mining on their land. There is no question about the ticket I was elected on. It was not uranium mining, I stress, but mining. It could have been mining for iron ore or for marshmallows. They did not want mining of any description on their land.Because I knew that 100 per cent of my constituency had that view I represented them, as I was elected to do, as ably as I could to prevent mining on their land, and we failed. The government of the day, in a highly controversial debate-a document was subsequently produced Uranium: Australias decision; I remember it well-determined that in the national interest the wishes of those people would be put aside and mining would proceed. That decision was taken in accordance with the formal recommendation of the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry that had been set up by the previous Labor Government.In those days, when Aboriginal people were vociferously opposing mining on their land, they were accused on a daily basis, and I along with them, by the uranium lobby and the mining industry generally-I still have yellowing files of Press reports demonstrating this-of being tools of the environmental movement, of being mindless creatures of the anti-uranium lobby when, in fact, they were neither; they were simply Aboriginal land owners doing the best they could to make decisions themselves about what they wanted done with their land.After the mines were established because the opposition to them did not prevail, the Aboriginal people of the Kakadu region established, over the last eight years, a very effective working relationship with the mining companies. Honourable senators might like to ask themselves why, in all of the controversy surrounding the uranium industry, there has been no controversy in the last eight years about the operations of those two uranium mines on Aboriginal land. The reason is very simple: it is that the Aboriginal people exert a considerable degree of control over how those mines operate. The operators, sensibly, are very sensitive to Aboriginal opinion and, in their own interests, if nothing else, if not for altruism, bend over backwards to maintain a proper working relationship with the Aboriginal people of the area. In other words, that relationship has been successful.Aboriginal people, being intelligent people with minds of their own, have learnt over the last eight years that they can work cooperatively, at least with the companies that operate those two uranium mines. Into the bargain, they have received benefits of $96m over that period, which they have used to purchase a motel in Kakadu National Park, to construct a second motel which will open this year, to establish their own health service employing their own medical practitioner to deliver health services to them, to establish their own school and to provide themselves with vehicles and transceiver radios so that the out-station communities can communicate with each other. They have done that as a result of the mining royalties. At the same time, as I have said before, through one of the ablest and most articulate organisations in this country, the Northern Land Council, they have exerted a considerable degree of control over and supervision of the mining industry.We now have, in 1988, the National Secretary of my Party appearing on national television and saying that the Aboriginal people who are coming here on Wednesday, whom I hope he will have the decency to meet, have no minds of their own and are simply captives of the people that they are employing professionally to assist them with the media. I do not like that statement because it is undiluted racism of the worst kind. We all employ professionals to help us, particularly in this line of business. It is amusing that the person who is being discussed, Richard Farmer, who is being employed largely on my recommendation-because he is an extremely competent journalist-to assist them with the media, is a journalist that the Labor Party has employed on many occasions to assist it with campaigns. So it is interesting to hear that from the National Secretary of the Labor Party.Ten years ago when Aboriginal people opposed mining on their land, they were not slaves of the environment lobby, the greenie lobby. They were trying to make decisions for themselves about what they wanted for their land. Ten years on, because they now support uranium mining on their land, they are not captives of or being manipulated by the pro-mining lobby; they are simply consistently trying to do the same thing as they were doing 10 years ago-make decisions for themselves about what they want on their land. In my view they are entitled to do that. They are entitled to come to Canberra and they are entitled to make representations to their Government about what they want for Koongarra. They are entitled, as we are all entitled, to employ any number of professional persons that they wish to employ to assist them in that regard.These people who are coming to Canberra are part of a company; they are involved in a substantial joint venture with Denison mines which, if realised, will net them $256m over 10 years. That is an amount of money which, of course, will give them significant financial independence, and will allow them to get an even firmer stranglehold on the tourism infrastructure in Kakadu National Park which will provide them with jobs, career opportunities and security for a period which will far outlast the mines. I do not think it is a remarkable thing that, under all of those circumstances, they would want the mines to go ahead. It would be extraordinary, frankly, if they did not.It is remarkable, however, in my view, that non-Aboriginal people in this country, particularly in politics, can employ any number of accountants, lawyers, speech writers or journalists, professionally to assist them, and that is a matter that goes without any comment at all. But when Aboriginal people presume to do the same thing they are labelled as mindless tools of the very people they employ. It is not true. It is absolutely untrue. On behalf of my constituents I refute it. I condemn the person who has made that statement and I am publicly suggesting in this chamber that on Wednesday he should take the opportunity of meeting these people. I hope to bring them into the Senate chamber so that perhaps at Question Time they can see how their Parliament operates. I might even take them up the hill and show them the Taj Mahal. They can have a look at that as well.Whatever point of view is expressed in this uranium debate, whether one is for it or against it, the one argument that I could at least expect to be stilled in 1988 is the argument that the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory are simply the mindless tools of others. They are not. They have their own minds. They express themselves articulately through their organisations. They want those mines to go ahead and, whether one agrees with that or not, that is what they want. They do not want what other people have put in their heads. I refute those suggestions absolutely.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[74]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not aware of any change in Cabinet on these policies, so I support them as they stand. That equals three mines. I am asked what will happen at the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Conference next week. I will not answer on two grounds: firstly, I do not believe it is the province of Estimates committees to delve into what might happen at the ALP Conference and, secondly, anyone who tries to predict a week in advance what will happen at that Conference should have his head read.I come to some of the specifics raised by honourable senators, in particular by Senator Tambling, on the question of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the suggestion that the functions of the OSS be transferred to a university college in Darwin. Mr Coulter from the Northern Territory has spoken to me about that. It is something on which I have left the door open.There is at times a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the OSS. It is not to come up with engineering solutions for environmental problems caused by mining. Rather, for this Government, it is to monitor the effects of mining and to ensure that there are no deleterious effects on the environment and, if there is, for it to tell us so that we can insist that something be done about it. However, it is not the case that that means there can be no transfer. It is something which I am prepared to pursue with Mr Coulter. In fact, when I saw him in Sydney a few weeks ago, I asked him to give me a detailed proposition on this so that I could have a proper look at it; and I shall do so.I am asked about reports of my Department, of Treasury and of every other department about uranium mining. I have not got any. The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is not in the habit of asking for those sorts of reports. Neither the National Parks and Wildlife Service nor the OSS, to my knowledge, is conducting any inquiry into uranium mining and its environmental effects at the moment. We are more heavily engaged in other matters. When it comes to the ALP Conference, I will be making up my mind as a delegate along with 98 others. I have not even found out what the agenda will be yet, let alone decided what I will do with any matter that comes up. Given that my esteemed colleague Senator Sanders did not raise a point of order when his remarks were referred to by Senator Parer as insanity, I would have to say that I do not agree that Senator Sanders is insane-he is just wrong. This is a democracy and he is entitled to be wrong.I am not going to give Senator Sanders my views on where I stand on these matters.

443,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator RICHARDSON","4E4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories)",3152,"—That Senator Boswell once again is the victim of his total inability at any stage to come to grips with the Governments decision in north Queensland would be a surprise to no-one. He has constantly raised the matter of these consultants reports. We have heard it time and time again. He has tried to build something of an image in Queensland as the man who forced me to release them-which, of course, is nonsense. The reality is that during 1987 I had given Senator Durack an undertaking to release the reports-and I released them, as I always said I would, immediately after the Governments consideration of them was completed and the Cabinet decision taken. It had nought to do with freedom of information or anything like that; it had everything to do with the proper process of government, and that was to get hold of these reports and examine and study them, just as we are doing with the Helsham report, to make sure that the Governments decisions were correct.The question is: What decisions were we having examined by these consultants? Senator Boswell is quite right. There were any number of consultancies: on the regional economy, by Griffith University; on alternative employment, by Griffith University; on social impacts, by Griffith University; on the timber industry, by ACIL Australia Pty Ltd; on the mining industry, by the National Environment Consultancy; on the tourism industry, the same. So, there were plenty of consultants-and they cost $300,000. Having said that, I point out that these consultancies were all commissioned by the Government in order to determine the appropriate response for its compensation package. They were never commissioned to tell the Government whether nominating the area in north Queensland for World Heritage-which we did in the end-was proper. They were never asked to assess whether we had sufficient scientific value in those forests. The reason we did not get consultants to do that was that there was already on the table a welter of scientific evidence to that effect.As Senator Boswell would recall in my response last week on the question of Senator Puplicks disallowance motion, I went through the names, scientist after scientist, here in Australia and around the world. The values of the area were put on the table. I think that ought to answer forever the scientific argument. However, we still needed to know-that is why we have the consultants-just what all the effects of those decisions would be so that we would have a compensation package in place in time for those workers who would have been affected. We were told by Senator Boswell and others that if it was not in place by March all hell would break loose because the workers would all be laid off. When Senator Boswell raised those queries I said that we believed that so much extra timber has been taken that the mills would stay open until June or July. Who was right-Senator Boswell or me? Given that the mill is still going and it will be June in the next day or so, I am, once again, proved correct. All that happened was that the Government made sure it examined the reports in detail and I have got to make sure at the end of the day that we can live with that package. I am very confident that we can. It was carefully thought out and it is working well.Senator Boswell asked questions on tax. We have raised these queries with the Commissioner of Taxation. He has not yet replied. However, I am anticipating an answer very shortly and when I get one I shall make sure that Senator Boswell is the first to hear about it, or the second after me.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[79]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would like to ask the Minister about the Tasmanian Governments misappropriation of funding in that area. It has come to my notice that the Tasmanian Government is intending to close the Collingwood Bridge Ranger Station in the Wild Rivers World Heritage area. The Commonwealth funding for this station will be used to fund a Lands Department office in Queenstown, which will deal primarily with local Tasmanian issues. I feel that this represents a complete misuse of funds which were primarily intended for management of the World Heritage area.To summarise the events as I understand them: Firstly, the Collingwood Bridge Ranger Station, which is the only station in the Wild Rivers National Park, will be closed. As the Minister is probably well aware, this is where the rafters on the Franklin actually start down the river. It is an essential ranger station. It monitors the rafters. It sees that people have the proper gear and that they are going to be able to operate on the river safely. It is a major ranger station in the Wild Rivers National Park.Secondly, the station and the three staff members will be moved to Queenstown which is a 50 minute drive from the national park where they will deal with a large number of non-World Heritage issues. Thirdly, the Queenstown office will deal primarily with Tasmanian west coast Lands Department issues. Fourthly, funding for the office will be at least partly from Federal funds provided specifically for management of the World Heritage area. Fifthly, information provided to me indicates that the Lands Department already has two officers, one at Strahan and one at Queenstown, who are currently working on non-World Heritage matters, but who are funded from Commonwealth funds. This is misappropriation of the worst sort and it is the kind we have come to expect from the Liberal Government in Tasmania. Quite apart from the ethical issues of using funds for purposes for which they were not intended, it seems quite absurd that the only ranger station in the Wild Rivers National Park should be closed and replaced by an office many kilometres away.I hope that the Minister investigates this matter. If he does not have any information on the subject at hand, I urge him to investigate this matter at the earliest opportunity and make sure that two things occur: Firstly, that the rangers are still on duty at the Collingwood Bridge Ranger Station and, secondly, that the Liberal Government of Tasmania, the Gray Government, is no longer allowed to misappropriate Federal funds.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[80]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

It was originally proposed that it be spent on a tourist mine in Queenstown in place of the mine there when it closes. That is now not happening and there has been a proposal from the Premier to the Federal Government that the money be diverted to the upgrading of 28 kilometres of the Lyell Highway between Donaghys Hill and the King River deviation. This would mean increased access to west coast areas for tourists and improved living standards for the residents of the west coast who were to be the main beneficiaries of the dam compensation money.

I ask the Minister whether this Government will take any responsibility for making the decision. Is it going to pay interest on the money that it will not fork out?

As a result of the questions which were raised, the Department undertook an investigation and prepared a report.

Margules in the area around Kellys farm. Ranger L. Margules has been employed as a rural ranger by this Administration for 38 years. During the whole of this time his area of responsibility has been the Paddys River Stromlo districts (see Map) and parts of Tuggeranong prior to residential development. His area of responsibility has always included Kellys Farm.Areas withdrawn from rural lease for Reserves as in the case of the Murrumbidgee River Corridor (area 4) and the Urambi Hills (area 3) do not come under the responsibility of Ranger Margules. Whilst Ranger Margules is directly responsible for supervising the land agisted by Mark Dallas (area 2 on the attached map) his supervisors ensure that management of this block conforms with our overall requirements for agistees. The Administration will be taking steps in the near future to alter Ranger Margules area of responsibility to exclude area 2 from his patrol.In future if an Administration employee seeks to be involved in a leasing or agistment arrangement where a discretionary decision is required by the Administration, that decision will be taken by the Portfolio Secretary.You also asked whether there was easy access for horses from Kambah Pool Road to the Government Horse Paddocks. The access for horses from the Kambah Pool Road to the Government Horse Paddocks north of Mt Neighbour will follow the National Horse Trail which will be officially opened on June 5 1988. It is marked on the attached map.You asked that the Administration confirm in writing its intention to allow horse agistment on that part of Kellys Farm not required for the Youth Haven. It is the intention of the Administration to develop a joint management plan involving the Lions Club, the Kambah Pony Club and the Administration. Horse agistment would play an important part in this management plan. We have written to the Kambah Pony Club advising them of this matter.Yours sincerelyJ. A.

Kelly of some of the land referred to. They have been required to move. They received a notice to that effect I think in about March of this year. They have lived in that area for eight years. They have received a final notice requiring them to move by 10 June of this year, and that notification is dated 5 May 1988. These people, who as I said have lived there for eight years, are attempting to arrange to purchase property in the Yarrowlumla Shire and wish to move there and will be constructing a house there, and they have asked that they be given the opportunity for an extension of some months to enable them to do so. It would seem to me not unreasonable that that should occur, but up until now they have had what they regard as a fairly blank response from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. It may be somewhere nearer the end of this year before they will have their arrangements finalised and a house built on that property. I wonder whether, in the circumstances of all that has gone on in relation to this, there is any good reason why they should not be able to remain living on that property for some further period of time.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[90]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

They are losing the home they have had.

If they are promiscuous, that implies that there will be other partners down the line. Whether someone was at school or not would not be the problem. The problem would be whether they were indulging in the behaviour that causes the problem. Sadly, some young people who are still at school do so. It is the Governments concern to make sure that anyone who is a potential risk of either spreading the disease or catching it is advised of the best way to take precautions to make sure that that does not happen.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1987-88","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[107]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I did see what Senator Reid referred to as art work. I must confess that I have yet to see a bus on which the advertisements are displayed.Although I have seen the artwork, I could not see anything in it which promoted promiscuity. As I said earlier, we cannot legislate to prevent promiscuity. But what we can do as a government is try to lift education levels on the subject to a point where people can understand the consequences of their behaviour. That being the case, a government has a duty to protect public health. As Senator Puplick points out, the weight of evidence is that we are moving in the right direction. I have seen absolutely no reason so far why we ought to change.

Special benefit is not payable to a prohibited non-citizen.(1) (b) (i) Ten years as an `Australian resident at any time, of which at least five years must have been continuous.(ii) No period as an `Australian resident required where permanent incapacity or blindness occurred in Australia. Where permanent incapacity or blindness occurred outside Australia, the required residence conditions are the same as for age pension.(iii) No period of residence required if the claimant and her husband were `Australian residents at date of widowhood or where the event by which a claimant became a supporting parent occurred in Australia. In other cases the requirement is a continuous period of five years as an `Australian resident immediately preceding the date of lodgement of the claim or a continuous period of ten years as an `Australian resident at anytime.New Zealand citizens are precluded from supporting parents benefit during their first six months in Australia.(iv) and (v) A person must be an `Australian resident throughout the period of payment. New Zealand citizens are precluded from unemployment benefit during their first six months in Australia.(vi) A person must be a resident of Australia throughout the period of payment. Special benefit is not payable to a prohibited non-citizen.(2) (a) and (b) Reciprocal social security agreements can enable periods of residence and/or periods of residence and/or periods of contributions in other countries to be added to periods as an `Australian resident to meet the minimum Australian residence requirements for pensions.(3) (a) Yes. Pensions paid by other countries are regarded as income for purposes of income testing Australian pensions and benefits. However, there are certain exceptions, for example:Payments which are in respect of children;German restitution payments, other than amounts for loss of income;Reciprocal agreements can provide for the exemption of certain foreign payments such as government supplements, but this depends on the nature of the payments and the concessions given under the agreement by the other country.(3) (a) Foreign pensions are treated in the same way as all other forms of income in the application of the income test, i.e. all income is added together and the Australian pension is reduced by one half of the total income above specified limits. However, special rules apply where a person qualifies only because he or she has counted overseas periods as Australian residence. In these cases, the foreign pension is directly deducted from the rate of Australian pension.(4) (a) As for (3) (a).(4) (b) Foreign pensions are treated in the same way as all other forms of income in the application of the income test on fringe benefit concessions. In cases where foreign pensions are directly deducted from the rate of Australian pensions, they are not treated as income for fringe benefit purposes.(5) (i) A reciprocal agreement on social security was signed with Italy in April 1986 and Australian legislation to give effect to it was enacted in December 1986. Australia is ready to ratify the Agreement. The corresponding Italian legislation was approved by the Italian Chamber of Deputies on 26 April 1988 and is awaiting approval by their Senate. When this occurs it will be possible to exchange instruments of ratification to bring the agreement into effect.(ii) Exchanges of information on the Greek and Australian social security systems have taken place and it has been agreed that a detailed information paper is to be prepared for consideration by the interested communities in both Australia and Greece. A number of technical issues need more detailed examination before the paper can be completed. Community consultations will take place when the paper has been finalised. Further discussions with Greece will be considered after these community consultations have taken place.(6) (i) The only obstacle to bringing the Italian agreement into effect has been the delay in passage of Italian legislation.(ii) The Government has stated that no negotiations towards an agreement will proceed unless they have the support of the communities they are designed to help. As yet, there is not general support for an agreement within the Greek community in Australia.

Is the Minister aware that because of this legislation, persons will be without claim against anybody for restitution and must now take out all insurance on their own behalf, which, even if obtainable, would be cost prohibitive? Is he further aware that should there be another disaster, such as the Ash Wednesday fires, the Natural Disasters Organisation and the Department of Finance would now not be refunded from ETSAs insurers as was the case previously? Is he also aware that there would have been $400m worth of bankruptcies in South Australia if ETSA had not been liable for Ash Wednesday and that consequent upon this legislation, such an amount may in future be sought from the Federal Government as disaster relief? In view of the national implications of this legislation, will the Minister bring his influence to bear on his Australian Labor Party colleague, South Australian Premier Bannon, to withdraw this outrageous legislation or, alternatively, will the Minister give his assurance, that the Federal Government will reimburse legitimate claimants for all damage caused in the future by ETSA, including in the event of major disasters? Will he also give his assurance, in light of the dangerous precedent established by this legislation, that the Government will remain liable for all uninsured Federal government instrumentalities now and in the future?The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:The Bill to amend the Electricity Trust of South Australia Act 1946 contains no provision limiting the liability of the Electricity Trust of South Australia for damage caused by bushfires started by the Trusts infrastructure or activities.

535,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Cook","RF4","N/A","ALP","N/A",3164,"—On 18 May 1988 (Hansard, page 2402) Senator Harradine asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, the following question without notice:My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, follows his statement to the Senate today that the priority for the Governments national health policy is disease prevention. Has the Ministers attention been drawn to the statements by Dr Ditta Bartels, a Sydney molecular biologist, to the Australia and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science conference, that quality controlled babies produced through genetic engineering may soon become the norm and that a new technique would allow genetically defective embryos or those of the wrong sex to be discarded before they were implanted in the uterus? What taxpayers funds are going towards the diagnostic techniques and proposals for the establishment of genetic registers of persons and families with histories of genetic disorders which would be essential in the establishment of such a filtering system for humans? If taxpayers money is going towards this, in the case of genetic diseases does the Governments policy of disease prevention really mean prevention of individuals with genetic diseases from being born?The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question:I am aware of the statements by Dr Ditta Bartels at the recent Australia and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science conference regarding genetic engineering of human embryos.I am advised that no taxpayers funds are being provided by the NHMRC for diagnostic techniques or genetic registers which would be used as a `filtering system for humans with a view to discarding embryos before they are implanted in the uterus. However, prenatal diagnosis of a number of serious genetic defects has been available for the last 15 years. It has been used only in couples at special risk who request testing. Downs Syndrome in older women and spina bifida in women who have had a previous affected baby are the most frequent reason for testing. There are also a number of other serious genetic diseases that are now detectable. Prenatal diagnosis of these has allowed couples who previously felt unable to have further children to go ahead and produce healthy children. All couples using these tests are counselled about the options open to them. It is important that couples in our society who face these decisions should have available this form of modern medical assistance.With respect to genetic registers, Senator Harradine would be aware of a Working Party set up by the NHMRCs Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC) to prepare a background paper on the ethical implications of registers of patients and families with inherited disorders. The reason the NHMRC undertook this task was because researchers in the field have become aware of the need for ethical guidance relating to the setting up, maintenance and use of information in such registers. The report of the Working Party is expected to be submitted to the Medical Research Ethics Committee in the near future.The Governments policy on disease prevention is directed primarily to influencing lifestyles which will avoid factors known to contribute to the development of disease. However, it is also known that in the case of a number of genetic diseases, early detection and treatment can avoid prolonged complications and morbidity in later life. Senator Harradines inference that the policy includes the prevention of individuals with genetic diseases being born is ill-founded.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qwn[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
