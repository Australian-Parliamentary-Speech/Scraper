There is, however, one alteration* to which I desire to direct the attention of the Committee. . The Treasurers Advance is increased from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000. The Committee will understand, however, that this does not alter the total, as the Treasurers Advance, being merely money temporarily lent to the Treasury, is always deducted. The main reason for this is the increase of war pensions. The Estimates provide £5,450,000 for war pensions for soldiers and sailors; but it is now seen that the pensions will total £6,200,000, which is an increase of £750,000 above what the Treasury expected it would be for the financial year that closes on the 30th June nest. This is due chiefly to the rapidity of the demobilization work, bringing in a greater number of claims in a given time to the counter of the Treasury, and also to the rapidity of the discharge system accomplished in the later days of demobilization by the Defence Department. Although this involves an increase of £750,000 for this financial year, it is estimated at the Treasury that the extra sum of £500,000 granted by the Committee of Supply will be sufficient to enable us to finance the increase with the savings made in other directions. 1 would like, with your permission, sir, and the patience of the Committee, to give some idea of the revenue position and prospects, of the expenditure conditions of today, and also of the loan position so far as honorable members wish to hear it at this stage. First of all, as to the direct taxation yield. Most of the revenue, as old honorable members, particularly, know1, from direct taxation, such as land and income tax, wartime profits taxes, and estate duties, comes in towards the last period of the year, most of it during the last quarter. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to give any useful comparison of the actual receipts with the estimate, nor to give interesting matter comparing other years with this year! It is expected, however, by indications in the Taxation Office, that the revenue from direct taxation will be as much as was expected and stated in the Budget, notwithstanding the considerable relief which must be given to persons who have suffered from drought during the period covered. I remind honorable members that both in the Income Tax Act and the Land Tax Act there is provision by which those who have suffered from causes of this kind beyond their control may state their case for a reduction or postponement of taxation, and machinery is provided for hearing such cases.

The estimated expenditure of the Postal Department for 191920, including new works, is £23.,456 above the estimated revenue, as honorable members will see by consulting the figures of the Budget. That expresses the Treasury view, which, of course, takes into account only cash inwards and outwards, as .a banker does. The Postal Department, however, issues, after the close of each financial year, a commercial balancesheet, which does not charge . capital expenditure against the revenue of that year, but debits, the Department with only the  interest on the capital expenditure. In these commercial balancesheets, which., I think, .a«re wisely drawn by the Postal Accountancy department, are certain interesting figures which will afford food for reflection by honorable members. About two years ago., in order to test the basis upon which the Post Office balancesheet was drawn and presented to Parliament and the people, I asked the AuditorGeneral to carefully consider the whole of the principles embodied in that balancesheet, and to certify, if he conscientiously could, whether it was framed on sound principles and afforded all the information that Parliament might desire to know. Speaking from recollection, the certificate of the AuditorGeneral stated plainly that the balancesheet was correct, and its principles thoroughly tenable from the standpoint of accountancy. Taking two of those commercial balancesheets, 1 find that for the year 19 17 IS the Postal Departments profit is shown to have been £387,000, and for the year 191819 £524,000, according to the most expert principles of balancesheet building. In arriving at these results, revenue from war postage is not included. For the information particularly of those honorable members who were not in the House during last Parliament, when the War Postage Act was passed, I remind the Committee that we deliberately instituted as part of our war finance % taxing system through the Postal Department. We lifted the postage rate here and abroad by a definite sum. That was regarded as a tax to be paid by .the users of the Post Office, and the proper yield of that tax goes dissect to the Treasury., and is therefore not included in the receipts for the Postal Department. Therefore, those figures are excluded from the results for the two financial years mentioned. To earn a profit in a large Department of this kind during the war period was, in my opinion, quite justifiable; but the Government are of opinion that the Post Office, in its ordinary working, apart from war postage, should not continue to be used as a taxing machine. The Government, therefore, nave given consideration to the condition of telephone and mail services in country districts and are engaged in the development of a scheme which will provide additional facilities of this nature for rural residents. We hope to thus increase the contentment and prosperity of our primary producers. ","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 4) 191920","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/para[8]","N/A","N/A"

It is doubtful if we shall be able to keep the expenditure within that limit. Signs of excess appear that will have to bie. faced by the Treasury before the end of the financial year. For houses., land settlement, and other repatriation disbursements payable from loan the estimate of expenditure for this year was £12,360,000. It appears now that the actual expenditure in this case also will be above the estimate. I remember that when some of the original repatriation estimates were presented, and when Supply in the earlier portion of this financial year was being requested from the late Parliament, some honorable gentlemen, on both sides, I believe, said that we had no intention oi spending so large an amount as was placed in the shop window ; others doubted whether such expenditure would be necessary ; and a third lot doubted whether we would be able to expend that amount. It is perfectly plain that the outgoings from both loan and revenue tills will exceed the amount which was estimated in the earlier part of the financial year as necessary for repatriation purposes. If this were ordinary .Departmental expenditure, I should feel disposed, and I think the Committee would probably be desirous of insisting, that full particulars of the excess be given; but I take leave to make no apology for this expenditure. So far as I, as Treasurer, am able to judge, it is being wisely administered. The complaint, if any, is that the expenditure is not sufficiently generous, but the fact that we are likely to exceed the expenditure from both sources that we previously thought necessary is clear proof that the repatriation machinery is working swiftly and is dealing with a large number of cases. As one who believes that our repatriation system is at least as generous as any devised amongst the belligerent nations, I regard this expenditure as a matter for congratulation. Whatever moneys Parliament has raised through taxation or can raise from the pockets of the people by loan should be, if wisely expended, cheerfully expended to repatriate and restore to civil life the men who fought on land and sea ; and I say quite plainly that the expenditure from both revenue and loan sources will have to be exceeded at the end of the financial year.

The Budget of October last disclosed that the Commonwealth required £40,000,000 to be raised by loan during the present financial year to meet war and repatriation expenditure. Just about the time the Budget opened a loan of £25,000,000 was issued. The balance of £15,000,000 has not yet been raised.

Even after an extension of dates, after as vigorous a campaign as the Government could devise or its organization carry out, and after definite statements by the head of the Government and the Finance Minister, that unless the amount was raised compulsion by Statute would follow, we were still about £3,000,000 short after the, extension of time had closed ; whereupon the associated trading banks of Australia, including the Commonwealth Bank, undertook to take their share, and thus we were able to find the £25,000,000.

Great Britain. During the early stages of the war we borrowed in actual cash from the United Kingdom £47,500,000 sterling, and we used it in our general war expenditure. The British authorities stipulated that the principal of the indebtedness should be increased in accordance with any additions caused to the war debt of the United Kingdom by conversion operations. That total of £47,500,000 has, as a matter of fact, become already £49,000,000 by the successive conversion operations conducted by the British authorities in accordance with the requirements of the time, and the original arrangements with the Australian Government. Now, this £49,000,000 is really a bonded debt, repayable to the British Government at various dates, ranging from 1925 to 1947. Quite apart from this bonded debt to the British Government,, we owed, on the 30th June last,. £37,000,000 for moneys paid by the War Office directly for the maintenance and equipment of our Australian Forces. That £37,000,000 is a book debt, or what might, be popularly described as an overdraft, obtained by the Australian Treasury, by permission of the War Office, from theBritish Exchequer ; and, although no definite arrangements have been made for repayment, the British Government has indicated that it desires early settlement. A further sum of £2,250,000 is due to the Admiralty in respect of transports, and repairs to and maintenance of Australian warships.

This offer, after careful consideration and advice from the best experts, was deemed to be too advantageous to miss, and the Government have accepted it, because it could not be held open indefinitely when so many similar plants are being scrapped. This plant will enable the Commonwealth, with the plant we already have, to manufacture munitions for field guns, and will make it possible to furnish our Defence Forces with the requisite equipment.

We have entered deliberately upon a campaign against unnecessary intermediaries. We seek to bring the consumer and the producer into closer touch, so that the farmer may obtain a fair return for his products, and the consumer be able to purchase at fair and reasonable prices. Hitherto the man in the middle has waxed fat at the expense of the two extremities. In prewar days the people of the cities had cheap bread, cheap meat, cheap milk, and cheap butter. But at whose expense ? Go into the dairying portions of Australia, ask the children of the dairy farmer, who are up at daylight in the morning to handle cows in the slush and cold of winter, in order that the people of the cities may get milk at 4d. and 5d. a quart. Ask the wheat farmer at whose expense the people of the cities were furnished with a cheap loaf. Ask, also, how much of the prices paid has hitherto been obtained by the producer. When these matters are put fairly before the consuming public of Australia, I am confident that a sense of justice will prevail. We must combat the inconsistency of people who submit calmly to an increase of 50 per cent, in the price of tobacco and protest at an advance! of Jd. per lb. in the price of bread. As a party, we intend to point to the inconsistency of men who are prepared to pay 6d. for halfapint of beer, and yet hold indignation meetings because milk is 5d. or 6d. per quart.

The honorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan) has quoted from the Privy Council judgment in the historic case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. That judgment discloses the disquieting fact that the Government lost its appeal and its right really to deal with this huge profiteering company, not on the merits of the case, but because the Crown: Law officers hae? committed an unpardonable blunder. In these two cases, our Legal Department has been guilty of extraordinary and unpardonable remissness. Our AttorneyGenerals Department costs the Commonwealth. £67,000 a year. We have, therefore, at least a right to expect that our legal work will be performed with ordinary skill and care. Of the cancelled Australian shipbuilding contracts we shall probably hear more in the future. But in passing, I would like to have proof of some inquiry of the ability of the contracting parties, prior to the contracts having been entered into, to fulfill their obligations. I am credibly informed that in one case the contracting party had not even a shipbuilding yard. Other statements of an equally serious character have been made. It will be sufficient for me to say that for the cancellation of these unfortunate contracts, the Government have to pay to the Wallace Power Boat Company Limited £51,892; to Messrs. Hughes, Martin, and Washington Limited about £70,000; and to Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh, for cancelling the building of four ships out of six, for which a contract was made, about £52,000; a total of £173,839. Eight of the Yankee ships, five motor boats and three steamers, have been sold, disclosing a loss on the transaction of £326,000. With the Australian contracts, there is thus a total loss on the cancellation of the contracts of halfamillion sterling. What it will cost to get out of the contract for the construction of the balance of the Yankee ships is necessarily mere guesswork. Probably it will amount to £500,000 and the whole of these contracts were entered into without the authority of this Parliament.

The decline in the production of butter and sugar cannot fail to seriously injure those engaged in dairying and sugar growing and the community generally; and, last, but not least, the baneful influence of the shipping rings, with their unholy increases in freights, cannot fail to have a farreaching and detrimental effect upon commerce and industry, and cause a disastrous decline in our national revenues.

We have no desire to take the business of Parliament out of the hands of the Government, but we declare that the control of the public purse should be restored to Parliament. Let us view the circumstances leading up to the moving of the amendment. We are asked to grant Supply for the current financial year which will cover the public expenditure to the end of the eleventh month. Upwards of eight months of the financial year have expired. Last year Parliament was suddenly dissolved unnecessarily and unwisely, I think eight months before the expiry of its term, so that members had not an opportunity to criticise the Estimates. It may be said that Estimates can be dealt with at any time on a Supply Bill, but that is not so. Supply Bills are based, not on the Estimates for the year with whose expenditure they deal, but on the appropriation of the previous year, it being customary for the Treasurer on introducing a Supply Bill to assure honorable members that it contains nothing new, nothing that was not covered in the last Appropriation Act. Supply thus granted is merely an advance for the purposes of the current year based on the rates of expenditure sanctioned for the previous financial year. While technically it might be possible to discuss the Estimates on a Supply Bill, actually and practically it is not. The expenditure of the Departments can be criticised only when the Estimates are before us. ","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 4) 191920","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/para[19]","N/A","N/A"

My earliest recollection of Parliament was that of a place where a member sat up all night, voted where he was put, and went home in the morning frightfully tired, but elated by the conviction that he had done some great thing necessary to his countrys safety, though, if one were going to be crucified, he could not say precisely what that was. Time has tempered the youthful enthusiasm, born, perhaps, of inexperience, of my early parliamentary life. I have come to see that Parliaments are prone to talk much and. do little. They are full of men who criticise, and very rightly, those shortcomings of Parliament which, I am afraid, are inherent in parliamentary government.

We must not forget that we live under a democratic form of government, and that the supreme authority is the people. We have been to the people, before whom the issues were quite clearly put. The honorable members sitting in the Government corner, and honorable members sitting (Opposite, put their views, as we did, before the people. I neither censure nor attempt to explain, or even comment on those views, though I could say much in regard to them if I chose. But I say that the people, having the choice of one of the three parties, chose the party which I have the honour to lead. The results of the election speak for themselves. A great majority of the electors supported the Government and its policy. It cannot be said that the people were not informed as to the very many shortcomings of the present Government in former Parliaments. Whatever charge may be laid against honorable members opposite, it cannot be said that they did not tell the people how far the Government fell short of perfection; and that can be said of some, if not all, of the members in the Government corner.

No doubt, as I said then, it has not been a good business for the Commonwealth.

That was the honorable members remedy for the acute shortage of shipping from which the Commonwealth, in common with all belligerent countries, was suffering. I do not wish to labour this matter; but will any honorable member say that, if I had authorized the building of these little schooners, the shipping problem would have been solved? It would have been a drop in the ocean, and a very insignificant drop at that. The honorable gentleman said, further, that the shipbuilders in Tasmania were prepared to construct those two schooners with hardwood for £25 per ton, instead of agreeing to which, the Government had gone to America, and paid more than £25 for vessels made of oregon. As it happens, at the very same time that we placed those orders in America for ships to be built of. Oregon, we placed orders in Australia for eighteen vessels of 2,600 tons to be constructed of Australian hardwood, and. also for twenty vessels of 5,500 tons to be built of Australian steel. So that we did incomparably more for shipbuilding, in Australia than the honorable member suggested. As honorable members have been told, the Americans, despite their reputation, turned out to be very dilatory and unsatisfactory workmen. The Australian workman is sometimes said to be one who is always on strike. I have stated over and over again that the Australian workman is one of the best in the world; and I invite honorable members to contrast what he did with the performance of his American fellow workman. As I have said, we not only placed orders in America, but also in Australia, for wooden ships. Now six of the steel ships which were placed on order here are in the water, and very good ships they are, too. We could make £50,000 profit on each tomorrow by selling them for coastal or for deepsea trade. The honorable member for Franklin did not say anything about these facts, but he might have done so, because, after all, they were the product of Australian labour and Australian material. As for the wooden ships, the orders for building which were placed here, they were to cost £26 a. ton about the price, by the way, which the honorable member for Franklin quoted to me in relation to the construction of the two schooners. They were to be propelled by Diesel engines. We gave orders to three companies the Wallace Power Boat Company, the firm of Hughes, Martin, and Washington, and Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh.. That was before I went to England, nearly two years ago. The honorable member said that the two schooners he spoke of would have been built in nine months. Whether they would or not I cannot say. All I know is that none of the Australian companies with whom we placed our orders for wooden ships carried out their contract on schedule time. Up to date, only two vessels of the eighteen have been completed, and they are without any engines in them. Now, the honorable member said that if I had placed an order with this firm in Tasmania, it would have put its two schooners into the water in nine months. As I say, whether they could or not, I do not know; but I know that I gave an order to a Tasmanian firm, and that it is the only firm which has produced nothing at all absolutely nothing..

I have always been taught that the elasticity of the English language is such that two persons possessed of average education can at least make themselves understood of each other. But evidently it is impossible for the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Country party on the one band, and the Prime Minister on the other, to make themselves intelligible to one another. The Leader of the Country party, with a carefully prepared manifesto, has cried aloud to the heavens that he has not the slightest intention of hurting the Government.. He would not give them one minutes cause for uneasiness, and he has assured them that the last thing he and his colleagues desire is that this country should lose their services. He told them that his party desired that the amount required by them for carrying on the public services of the Commonwealth should be reduced by onehalf, but that he had not the slightest wish to harass them by forcibly taking the control of the public business out of their hands. After this carefully prepared manifesto had been delivered, in which the Country party affirmed their desire not to take from the hands of Ministers the control of the finances, the Prime Minister rose to reply. In a very diplomatic speech he sought to learn just what they wanted. He said that he would afford the House an opportunity of considering the Estimates as soon as possible as soon as honorable members stopped talking, and began to work. I have yet to learn how a Parliament can work without talking. Of course, the Prime Minister and the Government may constitute themselves judges of the line of demarcation between talking and working. But I am not competent to say where talking ends and working begins. Probably criticism of the Government would be deemed to be talking, whilst adulation of Ministers would presumably be working. I suppose, too, that talking would be regarded as the task of the politician and working that of the statesman. Evidently the promise made by the Prime Minister was not just that which the Country party desired. Though they did not say so definitely, they evidently require from the Government a promise that the Estimates will be presented to this House either on the 18th March, 19th March, 20thMarch, or 21st March, as the case may , be. That would be an easy way out of the difficulty. Then why all this talk? The duty of the Government is clear. It has merely to name a date, and so save us from going back to our masters, the electors. I am indeed surprised that there should be so much mystery about the whole thing. It now appears that the bomb which was carefully prepared, primed, and set alight by the Leader of the Country party, means nothing.We are assured by the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Country party that it is not the intention or the desire of the party to harass the Government in any way whatever. If so, what is the meaning of it all?

When the Labour party moved a motion of noconfidence in the Government for the way in which they had carried out matters appertaining to shipping, the honorable member and the party who follow him had an opportunity of protesting in a practical manner by voting with us against the Government. Instead of doing so, they voted with the Government. They refused to take a practical opportunity of voicing their objections to the way in which the shipping of this country has been managed, and now at a later stage their Leader, evidently with the concurrence and approval of his followers, attacks the same Government for the way in which the shipping business has been handled. In the circumstances, we are justified in questioning their earnestness. What does it all mean? I do not pretend to know much about parliamentary procedure, because I have been here quite a short time, but to me it is astounding that the Leader and Deputy Leader of a party, and the party itself, should on one occasion vote with the Government when a noconfidence motion dealing with a specific case had been launched against them, and then at a later stage bring up exactly the same thing as one of the reasons why the House should have no confidence im the same Government. After all, why should there be any anxiety? I do not think the Prime Minister or his followers are much perturbed. The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) never looked more complacent than he does at present. He is not at all worried, nor are his followers worried about this motion. Why should they be? They know perfectly well that it means nothing. Only last week the Leader of the Country party said that it would be no fault of the Country party if the Government were not defeated. He has cooled off considerably since that time. He has no desire to defeat the Government today. Even if the whole of the Country party voted against the Government, the Government would not be in danger. If the Government were subject to the slightest danger, if there was the slightest cause for uneasiness, I venture to say that some of the Country party would either stay conveniently away or become sick.

Is the dream of the late PostmasterGeneral (Mr. Webster) coming true, and is he to be the Chief Commissioner, or one of the Postal Commissioners ? A re we going to place the Post and Telegraph Department under business control, which he said should be done? Personally, I do not think that those living in country districts would get better treatment from a Postal Commission than they got from the late PostmasterGeneral. Telegraphic and telephonic communications have been reduced, mail services have been diminished, country postoffices have been starved or done away with, official postoffices have been degraded to the rank of nonofficial postoffices, so that those who live in the country and those who represent country electorates have today nothing but condemnation for the administration of the Department of the PostmasterGeneral. City constituencies have not suffered in the same way, because of the great political pull that they possess. The remedy for the present state of things is easy, at least in this Parliament. The PostmasterGeneral (Mr. Wise) has told a deputation that his policy in regard to telegraph and telephone services will differ from that of his predecessor, but he will have practically to revolutionize his Department if he is going to improve the position of those who live in the country. According to the latest report of the PostmasterGenerals Department, which was ordered to be printed on the 23rd July last, there was, in 191718, in New South Wales, one official postoffice opened, and seven were closed, the total number of official offices in the State thus being reduced that year by six. No semiofficial offices were opened, but eight were closed; fortythree allowance offices were opened, and thirtyeight were closed. Those figures show the extent to which retrenchment has been carried in the Department, although there should have been no cutting down of mail services and electric communications. No true economy is made by reducing telephone, telegraph, and mail facilities in country districts.

Surely the Government do not intend to go on with the reckless spending of money, showing an Utter disregard of the opinions of honorable members. Hitherto, after the money has been spent, the Government have thrown the Estimates on the table, and, in effect, informed honorable members that, although what they complained of was probably wrong, all had been done under stress of circumstances, and matters could not be altered. As I say, I believe the Country party are enunciating a sound principle; and if the effect is that the Government are forced to introduce the Estimates in time to afford ample opportunity for their discussion, some good will result to the country generally.

Let me explain, for the benefit of new members, that the Isherwood design is a new type of vessel, in which the framing is built on longitudinal instead of transverse lines. The firm that holds the rights of this patent does not engage in steel shipbuilding; it is merely the patentee, and anybody adopting the Isherwood principle has to pay the firm a royalty of 3s. 4d. per ton. That royalty was paid on every ton of shipping built in Australia. I repeat that no other Government, and no shipbuilding firm of any standing, has adopted that type of construction, although it is in use for oil lighters on the American lakes. The most damaging and sinister aspect of the whole matter may be perceived when  we know that experts who were imported from Great Britain, and who are receiving thousands of pounds per annum to manage the ship construction for the Commonwealth, adopted a standardized design. The blue prints for this design cost some thousands of pounds. Everything had been put into working order for the construction of a ship fit to be built for or by any Government in the world. But the design was rejected, and the Isherwood principle was accepted by the Australian Government. I want to know why, and so do the people. Another damaging fact is that the British Government, after consultation with the leading shipbuilding firms of Great Britain, adopted a standardized type of ship construction which was not based upon a longitudinal frame, such as is the Isherwood design. This officially adopted design would have been given to us by the British Admiralty. Had the Imperial authorities been impressed with our requirements, and satisfied that we would have built ships upon that design, they would have been only too ready to make it available to us, without requiring one penny by way of royalty. This whole matter should be thoroughly investigated; we have a right to know whether there is anything behind it. Who is responsible? I want to know why Isherwoods manager should have been imported from Great Britain, together with three or four other officials employed by that firm, to take control of shipbuilding here.

In October, 1916, the basis of wool was fixed at15½d.; it was renewed in the middle of 1917 for another year, then extended in 1918 to cover clips for a year after the war. This has since been interpreted to mean all wool shorn up to June, 1920. For English and Scottish wool the initial price was in 1914 advanced 55 per cent.; in 1917, 50 per cent.; and in 1919, 60 per cent. But in 1919 the English farmers asked for an 80 per cent, advance. After prolonged consideration, the Government decided to abandon the purchase of the Home clip, and the wools have been sold, in the normal prewar manner, through the country wool fairs. Prices realized showed an advance of from 100 to 200 per cent, on prewar rates. The English and Scottish farmers were much too shrewd to hand over their wool to the Government.

Moreover, the Mother Country is highly developed, and prior to the war was receiving £400,000,000 annually from foreign investments, whereas Australia is a borrowing country and must send millions of pounds worth of primary products overseas in order to maintain her balance of trade. We are in the position of a man who has increased the mortgage on his property from £3,500 to over £9,000, with the result that he has to carry more than three times his former financial burden.

Apparently the dictatorship which has existed during the past four years has blinded Ministers to the fact that the wool is not theirs, but that of primary producers in Australia who have a right to know the conditions under which it is being disposed of. I venture to say that if the terms of the wool contract had been made clear to the people prior to the recent elections the Government would not have been again returned to office. A similar remark is applicable to the sale of our wheat. Concerning the Commonwealth line of steamers, I was under the impression that they had been purchased in order to keep down freights.

I need only mention, in this connexion, the Ministerial action in fixing the price of meat. I will give my own experience as an illustration. The margin between poverty and a living on a small area of land is a very narrow one indeed. As a small primary producer I have never found that the payment of wages was likely to break me; but I do know that the excessively high prices exacted by the Government have been responsible for placing many producers in a position of financial embarrassment. The action of the Government in fixing the price of meat was responsible for a drop of £2 10s. per head in the case of store stock that we had purchased for £12 10s. per head; and I know one station owner who lost 1,100 head of stock as the result of the action of the Government in fixing prices at that particular time of the year. As the wageearner has only his labour to sell, and is not able to make provision for a rainy day, discontent must manifest itself amongst the workers, because the figures of the Commonwealth Statistician prove that, although we have spent enormous sums upon war activities, the deposits in our banks have increased very considerably during the war period. The Government are not prepared to tax those who have large bank balances, and naturally, with the increased cost of living, and the higher burden of taxation which has to be borne by the small men, discontent is increasing, whilst constant strikes are a source of loss to both sides. The Labour party do not stand for strikes, but for a policy of arbitration. Every day that capital and labour are at strife with each other, national loss is incurred which we cannot afford. No small primary producer can ever say that wages are likely to break him, because he does not employ sufficient men to produce that result. I have purchased bags at 18s. per dozen, although those bags had cost the National Government only 9s. 5d. per dozen. They refused to sell to the farmers representatives, and sold the bags over their heads to the middlemen of Sussexstreet, Sydney, and the middlemen of other States. Many other instances of a similar nature could be quoted. Under the National Government the Necessary Commodities Commission fixed the price of chaff bags at 8s. a dozen, but at the same time refused to commandeer supplies, although that is the logical outcome of pricefixing. If you fix prices you must be prepared to commandeer supplies at that price. We could not get supplies. Stocks were held up, with the result that men had to pay 14s. a dozen for secondhand bags that were net worth 4s. 6d. to put their chaff into to save their stock. Yet gentlemen in the Corner party indorsed the action of the Government last week by voting for them.

The Blighty tweeds that are woven in Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh can be purchased in suit or costume lengths direct from the factories by the general public. Why should not the same practice apply here? When I brought the matter before the Treasurer, he asked why the tweed should not be sold at 10s. per yard if it could be made for 7s. 6d. per yard. I fail to see why it should not be sold direct to the public instead of the people being robbed. I showed Senator Russell the offer of a reputable firm to start with 500 suits, and supply what are known as half and quarter sizes, at £2 2s. per suit; or, if a tailormade suit were required, for £3. The infamy of the prices now being charged for suits of clothing may be estimated when I tell honorable members that 1 lbs. of greasy wool is sufficient to provide for a suit of clothes. The Government are supported by the profiteers who found their electioneering funds. Men were paid £750, and, in one case, £1,250, to organize the political campaign on behalf of the Government, who, however, came back with their numbers reduced from fiftytwo to twentynine. Another victory like that, and I daresay the Government will disappear from the Treasury bench a longwishedfor result on my part.

Ninety men were to be squeezed into an area suitable for about sixty. No one would sign on until some nien (about ten) were placed elsewhere to sleep. Hours usually called 4.45, and off duty about 0, on their late evening 9 p.m. No table, no forms for their meals; eating standing; very injurious to their health and digestion. The sleeping quarters, besides being badly ventilated, overcrowded, are so noisy owing to the winch which works Saturdays and week days, that it is a torture for a sick steward ordered, by the doctor to remain in his bunk. Aa the men had not enough uniforms to last out the voyage, they had to wash and iron them in their time off duty or in the night. The stewards get an hour before each meal to get clean and ready to serve the meal. The work is sweated work, owing to the gross selfishness of the passengers, and the carelessness of the Une. Many passengers, who are lazy and not ill, have all their meals in their cabins or on deck, so doubling the labour of the stewards and stewardesses. This ought to be stopped, except under doctors orders. Hence the cabins cannot be cleaned in their proper hours, making it impossible for the stewards to get through their work. The bathroom stewards and stewardesses, who ought to have their bathrooms cleaned in the middle of the morning, are still giving and preparing baths. A charge for all passengers who have meals in their cabins, except under doctors orders, would reduce this labour. It is a wellknown fact that many passengers remain in their cabins, and cause extra labour, who would not do it if charged extra if not sick.

Much has been said tonight, and I should like to add a word or two in support of the Government who desire to carry this Supply. Bill as presented. I may say  that, as a new member, I have been absolutely disgusted with the way in which honorable members have deliberately wasted the time of Parliament since we started our sittings. According to the GovernorGenerals Speech we were sent here to deal with matters of great moment to the country, yet we now find ourselves, after a fortnight, just where we started. A censure motion, submitted by the Opposition, occupied us for a week. We then started to try to get something done; but the Country party, in their desire to carry on the affairs of the country, have decided to hold up Supply still longer. It is absolutely necessary that the Government should get the Supply Bill passed. We do not want to go over past history, and criticise what the Government did during the last Parliament. Opposition members surely gave enough of that during the election campaign. I certainly heard enough; I. had to answer for the sins of Governments for the last ten years. If honorable members would bring forward something new for the Government to deal with, we  might get ahead with the business. We are told that one of the reasons for the Country partys proposal for the reduction of Supply is that it insists upon the Government exercising due economy. We have in this House a combination of the. Opposition and the Country party in an effort to browbeat the Government. The honorable member for Macquarie (Mr. Nicholls), in his speech last week, gave an illustration of what he desired for the economical working of the country. He insisted that the Government were spending too much money; but, at the same time, asked that 200 employees who have been discharged from the Lithgow Small Arms Factory should be continued in their employment, although we do not now want the rifles produced. Today the honorable member for . Dalley (Mr. Mahony) criticised severely the persons who were sent to America by the Commonwealth Government to supervise the construction of wooden ships. The honorable member evidently forgot that it was urgently necessary, when the contracts were made, that we should have more ships, regardless of whether or not they were in a proper condition.. It was more important that Australia should have ships in some condition, in order to get her produce away, than that the launching of them should be delayed at the shipbuilding yards on technical grounds. I could not help smiling when the honorable member said that those supervisors were receiving £500 per annum practically for doing nothing: I started to mentally compare them with some of the politicians, to the great disadvantage of the latter. In regard to the criticism by General Lassetter, the remark made concerning an honorable member in this Chamber might be applied to him, viz., that he is looking at Australian conditions today with the eyes of 1914. General Lassetter might be put in the same position, and be absolutely unable to answer for the opinions of the wheat and woolgrower? at the present time. A remark was also made that the British Parliament was not treated during the war period as this Parliament was. I was in England in 1915, and the squeals from the British Parliamentarians were almost as loud as those we have heard from members of the Opposition tonight. The British Government found it necessary to carry on the work of the country and to practically suspend the rest of the Parliament. If we could do the same in Australia, allowing a few strong men to carry on the affairs of the country, instead of having a lot of members talking and wasting time, the country might be the better for it. Exception was taken by the honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) to the remarks of the Prime Minister that this Parliament was elected to work, and not to talk. I could hardly understand the honorable members objection to that remark. Prom the way he was speaking, I judged that he thought that honorable members were returned to talk, and not to work.

I know that thousands of returned soldiers are anxiously awaiting that payment; indeed, they are worrying about it, for to some of them it may mean practically life or death. Every honorable member returned to this House is pledged to do his utmost to have the gratuity authorized by this Parliament as early as possible. Yet we find the Country party and the Opposition deliberately delaying the payment. Honorable members may disclaim that intention, but actions speak for themselves. The Government were prepared last week to bring in the Bill for the payment of the gratuity, but the Opposition deliberately moved a vote of noconfidence, which prevented the consideration of the Bill last week, and now we have from the Country party an amendment for the reduction of the Supply Bill.

Of course, there are still items having to do with defence, naval and military; but I would like to say something at this point in fairness to the honorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan) as regards the Ryan Thousand. I think I am safe in saying that no honorable member can speak of the  Ryan Thousand  from quite the same point of view as I am able to do.. When I came back in June or July of 191S, on short leave from the North Sea, I was asked by the State Government in New South Wales to proceed on a lecturing tour for the purpose of obtaining recruits for our depleted battalions. We were somewhat successful on the northern rivers; and on reaching Murwillumbah I received a wire from the Minister for Recruiting, desiring me to proceed at once to Brisbane and report to Mr. Ryan, who was then Premier of Queensland. Upon arriving in the Queensland capital I was received with every mark of courtesy, kindness, and consideration by Mr. Ryan, together with certain of his Ministerial colleagues. I recall at that very meeting his saying to me, What do you think of the idea of my being asked to put my name down for a Ryan Thousand? I said I thought it a very good idea, because we had to get men for the Queensland battalions, two of which had been scrapped for lack of reinforcements. I think that my saying what I did influenced the Premier in according his consent to the proposal. I see now, however, that we both made a mistake. No politician should lend his name to the project of raising any battalion or division of men. I went right through Queensland and secured a large number of recruits. I am going to say something now that I would really rather not make public, because it is something against my honorable friend, the honorable member for West Sydney. As each man enlisted I asked him whether he desired to join the  Ryan Thousand. In every instance, I believe, the recruit replied,  No, I do not. I asked why, and the invariable reply was,  I think it is up to Mr. Ryan to enlist himself. That is why we did. not fill the  Ryan Thousand. I have not made these statements with any intention of discourtesy, or to hurt the honorable member for West Sydney; but these are the facts, and they demonstrate clearly that no politician should lend his name to projects of this nature, although I admit that I advised Mr. Ryan at the time that he should do so.
