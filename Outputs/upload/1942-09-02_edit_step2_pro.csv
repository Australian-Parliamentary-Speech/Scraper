This sad event has removed from his family, and from a large circle of friends, a man who had for many years been associated with the public affairs of this country.Mr. Orchard was elected to the House of Representatives for Nepean, New South Wales, at the general election in 1913 and was re-elected in 1914 and 1917. He was a member of the Federal Parliamentary Recruiting Committee in 1917-18, and in his capacity of an Assistant Minister from March, 1918, ho was specially in charge of recruiting. He visited England at the invitation of the United Kingdom branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association in 1916. He resigned ministerial office on the 31st January, 1919, and retired on the expiration of the seventh Parliament in 1919.Apart from his notable work in connexion with the campaign for recruits for the Australian Imperial Force during the last war, into which he threw all his enthusiasm and organizing ability, he will be principally remembered for his work as a member of the Australian Broadcasting Commission from the 26th May, 1932, until the 31st December, 1939. He was specially fitted for the duties associated with the functions of the Broadcasting Commission by virtue of his special interest in, and knowledge of, music and drama.His widow and family will find consolation in the knowledge that he rendered fine service to his country, and earned the highest respect of his fellow men. I move -That this House records its sincere regret at the death of the Honorable Richard Beaumont Orchard, C.B.E., a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Nepean and a Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public Bervice, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE RICHARD BEAUMONT ORCHARD.

We were fellow members in this Parliament, and colleagues in the Government during the war of 1914-18 and in the post-war years. He was a man of fine character, upright and honorable. He was an excellent organizer and administrator, and as Minister in Charge of Recruiting rendered valuable service to the Commonwealth during a period of intense strain. It may be truly said of him that he was a man who loved his fellow men, for he devoted his life to their service, and was ever active in all movements designed to improve the conditions and promote the welfare of his fellow citizens. He met life with a smile. He went about cheering people up with friendly speech, with music and song, and he gave generously to those in need. He was a lovable man and thousands of people whose necessities he relieved, whose downcast spirits he cheered, will deeply mourn his loss. I sincerely regret his death, and extend my heartfelt sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE RICHARD BEAUMONT ORCHARD.

The late honorable gentleman also had the distinction of being a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament; of those who shared that honour, very few remain. He served his parliamentary apprenticeship as a member of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, to which he was elected in September, 1894, to represent East Bourke Boroughs, which seat he held until November, 1900, when he was defeated. At the general election in 1901, he was elected to the House of Representatives for Bourke, Victoria, and he was reelected in 1 903 and 1906. He became whip to the first Deakin Ministry, and served as a member of the Select Committee on Decimal Coinage in 1901. He was appointed an honorary Minister from the 28th January, 1903, to the 12th November, 1906. He was chairman of the Royal Commission on Postal Services 1908-10 - until December, 1908, when he resigned his seat on the commission. He was defeated at the general election in 1910.The late honorable gentlemanwas born in New Zealand, and as ayouth migrated to Victoria. At an early age he took an active interest in local government matters, and after a period of service in the Victorian State legislature, transferred his activities to the Commonwealth sphere on the establishment of federation.Although it is more than 30 years since Mr. Hume-Cook sat in this Parliament, his name has stood out prominently during the intervening period in connexion with many public movements. He was closely associated with the Australian Natives Association, and the Australian Industries Protection League, through both of which organizations he worked with enthusiasm and energy towards the advancement of Australia, and the prosperity of its people. These labours made a material contribution to the development of Australian industries. The deceased gentleman also took an active part in the administration of a number of societies established for the health and social welfare of the people. He gave unsparingly of his time and labour over a long period in the service of his country. I move - flint this House records its sincere regret at the death of the Honorable James Newton Haxton Hume-Cook, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Bourke, a member of the First Commonwealth Parliament and a Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE JAMES NEWTON HAXTON HUME-COOK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The late Mr. Hume-Cook was my friend - and our friendship, extending over 40 years and ripening as the years went by, remained unbroken to the end. He was, like myself, a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament, and remained a member until 1910. He had sat in the State Parliament of Victoria, where he had made for himself a reputation as a first-class debater, with a wide knowledge of public affairs. In the Commonwealth Parliament he proved that this reputation was well deserved.He spoke well and clearly, developed his arguments logically, and pressed his pointshome. As an organizer and administrator he took high rank. A master of detail, he had a range of outlook that enabled him to deal with matters in their broadest aspects. He believed in Australia, and was never tired of chanting its praises and advancing its interests. He was a life member of the Australian Natives Association, and until his death was one of the leaders of its governing council. He was a fearless champion of Australian industries. From his earliest years in public life he devoted himself to their development. For many years he was the secretary of the Australian Industries Protection League - an organization established to promote the interests of Australian secondary industries. He was a prolific writer on all subjects relating to. the expansion of Australian industries, and their present proud position is in no small degree due to his untiring labours. During his term of parliamentary life, I learned to know and to esteem him, and in later years, when our relations became still more intimate, to look upon him as a dear friend. The news of his death was to me a severe blow, and leaves me to mourn a man for whom I had conceived a sincere affection. To his wife and family I extend my deep sympathy.Question resolved in the affirmative. honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE JAMES NEWTON HAXTON HUME-COOK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is not merely a conflict between peoples; it is a clash between principles. We fight to assert, the democratic life of personal liberty against the living death of a -totalitarian system which enslaves the individual to party dictators. We fight to prevent the vast spiritual, social, political, economic and industrial progress achieved in past centuries from being thrown back into the chaos of a new kind of barbarism.Our effort is rising to new heights and is becoming worthy of the great cause. This budget epitomizes that effort in facts and figures. These are eloquent. But behind them is something vastly more- eloquent, vastly more precious - the spiritual zeal of our people, the readiness to sacrifice money, good*, labour and even life itself, as needed and when needed, to uphold the faith that is in us.The year just ended brought t.o us a new and nearer menace. We responded with a new and mightier effort - crystallized in the expansion of war expenditure from £170,000,000 in 1940-41 to almost double that amount last year. For the current year a further enormous increase is inevitable. Security reasons prevent me from giving in detail exactly what that means in the number of fighting men to be paid, equipped, fed and transported. But T can say that our fighting forces now exceed anything that we ever thought possible, and that our army of war workers behind those fighting men has risen to heights which seemed impossible. In our direct war effort we have more than three times n* much man-power as we had at any time in the last war. We are still expanding and this huge budget provides for payment of the financial price of that expansion.","In Committee of Supply:","BUDGET 1942-43","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Treasurer has also stated the need for additional revenue.The resolutions provide for the following increases of customs and excise duties : -Ale, beer, Ac. -1s. 7d. per gallon.Spirituous liquors - 15s. 6d. per gallon.Tobacco, manufactured - 2s. 8d. per lb.Cigarettes - 8s. per lb.Cigars -11s. 4d. per lb.Playing cards - 8s. per dozen packs.Matches - 4s. per gross boxes of 60 matches.The increases of duties have been so calculated that the whole of the amount paid by the public in increased prices as a result of the additional duties will be returned to the Commonwealth Treasury.The customs duties have been increased only to preserve the existing margin between customs and excise duties, and have little revenue significance, as importation of the goods on which higher duties have been imposed is restricted under the Customs (Import Licensing)Regulations. The increased revenue yield is therefore expected almost solely from excise duties.The only other item affected by the resolutions is customs item 370, wherein provision has now been made for goods, the property of the Commonwealth, irrespective of the manner in which they are used, to be admitted free of duty, when, in the opinion of the Minister for Trade and Customs, on declaration by the Comptroller-General, it is in the national interest to do so.Progress reported.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF PROPOSALS 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the time of their arrest, statements were made that they had been guilty of high treason and had planned to assassinate Cabinet Ministers and other personages. Subsequent events proved that as far as these members of the Australia First Movement interned in New South Wales were concerned, there was no foundation for the assassination charge. Because I do not know all the facts, I am not in a position to comment on whether they were guilty in any way of subversive activity, but it would appear that the charges were levelled in a moment of hysteria and were based upon certain information which was disclosed by an agent provocateur in Western Australia who had been associated in that State with some people who claimed connexion with the Australia First Movement.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At any rate, he was a rather disreputable individual socially, and it was upon his statements that the people in Western Australia were eventually arrested. There was no association, according to a recent press statement of the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), between the people in Western Australia and the people in New South Wales. Some of the people in New South Wales have been released. I have been advised that the tribunal presided over by Mr. Justice Pike, and including in its membership, Mr. Watt, Bt.C, stopped the proceedings half way through the appeal of one man, and told him that there was no case for him to answer. That man has since been released. The Attorney-General said that a statement would be made to Parliament outlining what the Government intended to do about those who had been interned and released and, presumably, about those who still remain in custody. I aus no more associated with the Australia First Movement than I am with the Communist party, but I have the conviction that justice has not been done to many, if not all, of those persons who have been arrested, and action should be taken speedily to satisfy the public mind that nobody is remaining in internment in New South Wales, just because he happened to be wrongly interned in the first instance. The position cannot remain as it is. Those persons have to be either brought to trial on the charges levelled against them or released - honorably released - and, if they have been wrongfully arrested, recompensed for whatever legal expenses they have incurred in trying to establish their innocence.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They were held incommunicado for a very considerable period, and, if they have been wrongly dealt with, the Government ought to be prepared to pay compensation to them. At any rate, this method of arrest and internment is a procedure which can have very dangerous consequences. As one who knows something of what happened in the last war, I am particularly desirous that nothing like it shall happen in this war, but it is quite possible that in this waT things will be done even worse than were done then.

The Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde), some months ago, expressed in extravagant language views about members of the Australia First Movement who had been interned. British subjects, against whom there was little or no evidence to justify their internment, have been kept in prison for four or five months. We do not intend to canvass this matter until the Attorney-General has made his statement, but we ask for an undertaking that we shall have an express statement in respect of the appeals heard, the grounds upon which the internees were released, and what justification there was for the statement of the Minister for the Army which rather suggested a great conspiracy throughout Australia amongst members of the Australia First Movement against the security of this country, so that Parliament shall have before it the information upon which a .responsible Minister interned British subjects. It is very important, it seems to the Opposition, that, in considering the liberty of the subject, particularly the liberty of a natural born British subject in this country, the responsible Minister in point of fact should be responsible for the internment of people upon suspicion only.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They cannot be brought to trial in open court, because, if that were done, the whole of the ramifications of national security and military intelligence would be disclosed to those people who wanted to know our under-cover men and our espionage system. There is in existence a tribunal composed of eminent legal men capable of sifting evidence; and, if the evidence placed before the tribunal be such as to warrant the release of interned persons, they are released. For national security reasons, the evidenceis not given in public. It is unfortunate that the Minister for the Army should have made the statement that he did.

108,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BRENNAN, Frank","JSC","Batman","N/A","N/A",46,".- There is only one aspect of this case to which I wish to refer. 1 associate myself in general with the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) and I dissociate myself with the utmost alacrity and enthusiasm from the observation of the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) that in time of war the homes of decent citizens who are subjects of the Crown may be invaded or they themselves be thrown into prison, even though the place of detention be known by the more euphonious synonym of an internment camp, on the mere suspicion of some person. For my part, I should not be prepared to condemn a dog to his kennel, much less seize a respectable person and imprison him, on the mere suspicion of the honorable member for Wentwortb that some offence had been committed. I do not agree that any person should be so treated. When the honorable member for Wentworth says that there are tribunals available for those who are interned, I take this opportunity to say that I fear that the processes of the law in regard to these tribunals are most sluggish in their operation, and that the availability of these tribunals to interned persons is more theoretical than real. I have in mind the case of a person in the city of Melbourne who is well known to me. He is, indeed, a fellow practitioner. He has been seized and placed in an internment camp in another State, apparently on suspicion - there has certainly been no trial - that he has been guilty of some subversive activity. I take leave to have my own suspicions about the case, namely, that the action of the authorities is absurd and preposterous. I admit that my view is based on quite insufficient evidence, but I do know the attitude of the gentleman in question towards the charges made against him, and I am sufficiently well acquainted with him to know in a general way what his outlook on international affairs is. I know, also, that he was an accredited candidate at the recent federal elections in a constituency not far removed from my own, and I venture to suspect that he is a decent British subject and an honorable citizen. I take this opportunity publicly to ask the appropriate Minister - I suppose it is the Minister for the Army - that the hearing of such charges before the proper tribunal be expedited, so that men may not be punished in advance of proof by long periods of detention without trial. That is the charge which the honorable member for Melbourne has made, and which, I believe, expresses a view which is shared generally by members on both sides of the House. At least I hope that it is. It may be that the Minister, because of his multifarious duties, is not aware of the delays that occur. I intend to bring before him the case of the particular person of whom I am speaking. But what applies to him applies equally to others. I am confident that the Minister will not fall weakly into the habit of following the bad example set during the last war, when it was the regular practice of Ministers to quote as their authority the suspicions of certain highly placed military officers with regard to certain individuals, and upon those ex parte statements to deny to citizens, or indeed to aliens, the protection of the laws of this country. My principal object in speaking at this stage is to ask that those internees who hav applied for trial before a tribunal shall have their appeals heard with the greatest possible expedition. It is foreign to our conception of justice to keep men in prison for long periods without trial, either in war-time or at any other time, even when they are suspected of serious offences. I hope, therefore, that those persons who are entitled to trial by a tribunal established for the purpose will be given a speedy trial and not be detained unduly without having been heard in their own defence.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On the Srd August, one of the internees in the Liverpool camp wrote to me, but the letter bore the postmark of the Sydney General Post Office, dated the 21 st August. Apparently it had been held up by the military censorship in the Liverpool Internment Camp for eighteen days before being sent to me. As a member of Parliament representing the electors, 1 regard that as a gross misuse of the censorship powers, particularly when not one word in the letter was censored. If the representatives of the people are to be treated in that way by the military censorship, I can only say that that censorship needs a thorough overhaul. I shall not say anything regarding what the Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde) said about these interned persons. He has explained that he was guided by reports received from certain intelligence officers. I remind him that because a gentleman is dubbed an  intelligence officer  he is not necessarily an intelligent officer. I believe that the Minister has been grossly misled by the reports, but his chief and greatest sin is that he has allowed these people to languish in internment for five months without any proper trial, or without taking any steps to inquire into their condition.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

According to the letter that I have received this man has not had a proper trial and he asks for one. Another person involved was a retired official over 70 years of age who had no personal association whatever with this organization. He had merely consented to be a trustee of certain funds of the newspaper which the organization published. This man was turned out of his bed at midnight and put into an internment camp, where he has remained ever since. Another had his business wrecked and he is in a bad way.

I am satisfied that when the Minister made his statement to the House he had chapter and verse for everything that he said. His officials had made inquiries and they believed the things they reported to the Minister to be true. I cannot see how the present Minister for the Army, or any other Minister, could be expected to make a personal investigation of the accuracy of all reports submitted to him by trusted officers. With due deference to the former Minister for the Army (Mr. Spender), I do not think that he would have made any further inquiry into the matter if similar reports had been placed in his hands. My complaint against the Government in relation to these men is that it did not bring them to trial. Persons in Western Australia, who were charged with offences which, on the surface, were much more serious than those charged against the members of the organization in New South Wales, were brought to public trial. The Government could have applied, under the National Security Regulations, for the trial to be held in camera, but it did not do so. I complain, in the first place, that the persons interned in New South Wales were not brought to speedy trial. I do not think that this is the fault of the Minister for the Army, because, with certain representatives of the men who visited Canberra, I interviewed the Minister and he told us that he would do his best to provide an early trial. Unfortunately the tribunals have been very busy, but the work of tribunals of this kind should not be allowed to become congested. If necessary, additional tribunals should be appointed.

These persons should be given an opportunity to vindicate themselves before a proper tribunal. The Crown should bear the expense of providing legal assistance to such persons, a.6 it does to persons charged with treason. The legal expenses of one man who appeared before one of these tribunals amounted to 200 guineas.I have been informed that another family was involved in expenses amounting to 400 guineas. One individual was advised by his solicitor that he would not have a chance of winning his case unless he engaged a leading barrister. The result was that Mr. Windeyer, K.C., was briefed. Some of these people have lost their life savings in expenses incurred in connexion with these tribunals. Not only should an immediate opportunity be given to these people to submit their cases to a tribunal, but also they should be provided with free legal assistance by the Commonwealth Government. I do not say that the. tribunals conduct their proceedings unfairly, but undoubtedly the representatives of the Commonwealth set out to keep these men in internment if possible.

When a statutory committee, composed of a barrister who has acted as a member of the Supreme Court Bench, and two other persons specially qualified to be members of such a tribunal, is set up, it is in the public interest, and a good general rule, having regard particularly to national security in time of war, to follow the committees recommendation. I think that the honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) will agree with that. Applying that principle to the interned members of the Australia First Movement, what do we find? The only persons who approached the statutory committee and pursued their appeals, and whose, release was recommended by the tribunal, have been released.

If further internments should take place, I trust that no statement will be made in this House while cases are sub judice. It is a well-established rule in Parliament that no reference should be made to a case while it is before a court of law. In these cases, unfortunately, action without precedent in the history of Parliament was taken by the Minister for the Army.I cannot understand why the Government handled these cases in one way in Western Australia and differently in N ew South Wales. In Western Australia, four persons were publicly tried, and nothing came out at the trial which was likely to prejudice the security of the Commonwealth.I cannot believe that there was any sound reason against the holding of similar trials in the criminal courts of New South Wales, if only the Commonwealth Attorney-General had felt so disposed. It is well to state afresh the fundamental difference between the rights and obligations of enemy aliens in Australian territory and of our own citizens in time of war. Enemy aliens, as a matter of fact, have no rights at all except what we choose to give them. A citizen, on the other hand, has both rights and obligations. If the citizen fails in his obligation - and one of them is loyalty to his country - there are laws enough on the Statute Book under which he may be tried and punished. I can understand, of course, that cases may arise in which the character of the person concerned is such that it is wise to keep him under restraint. I know something regarding the cases of some of the men who have been interned. One of them was an irregular correspondent of mine for years before the warthoughI have neverseen him. I think he is the man to whom the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) referred and he is a man well up in years. Another man had a very good record during the last war, yet he is still interned. There are certain aspects of this case which do not leave one in a very happy frame of mind. I believe in the rule of law in this country, but in this and certain other cases there is too great a tendency -to depart from the law and allow laxity to creep in.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The prosecutor before a military tribunal has to put the case for as well as against the accused. He has to say what he knows in his favour, which is not the rule in civil courts to-day. If every lawyer had to argue the case in the light of what he believed to be fair and truthful, very different decisions would often be given. This case will not be allowed to rest where it is. It is so extraordinary that if certain aspects be not cleared up in the speech which the Attorney-General will, I hope, make next week, other parliamentary methods of reaching a satisfactory conclusion will have to be used.I proposed also to deal with the point raised by the honorable member for New England (Mr. Abbott). My experience is not so bad as his, although it is somewhat similar. If a citizen of New South Wales has occasion to write to me or to the honorable member for New England, and there is nothing in the letter which should be struck out - and I have never had a word crossed out in any letter I have received - the censor has no right to hold it up. It is his business to pass such letters on at once to honorable members, who have certain responsibilities, not only to their electors, but also to the Commonwealth as a whole, responsibilities which we do not propose to surrender. On that point I agree for once with the honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender). As I say, certain aspects of this case must be carefully looked into by the Government, because if the explanation promised be not satisfactory the House will have to reach some understanding in regard to, not only this case, but also the future handling of similar cases. The Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) knows that I have not agreed with many of the methods employed for a long time past, but I have allowed them to pass without publicly criticizing them. At this stage I leave the case in the bands of the Attorney-General, and hope he will be able to produce next week something which will satisfy the House that the Government is alive to the situation and prepared to take it in hand.Mr. BERNARD CORSER (Wide Bay) 1 10.24]. - I .think that the Attorney-General and the House generally will concede that there are some points affecting those interned in this case that are not at all common. In the first place, those who claim to be members of the Australia First Movement in Western Australia would not have the sympathy of any section of the community, and certainly would not. be supported by any member of the House, but it has been asserted by those in the movement in New South Wales that they have no association with, and do not know, the four people who made the foolish statements in Western Australia. I am not aware which of the internees in New South Wales has been released, but I know something of the president of the movement in that State. If he is still interned I say in the name of British justice that something should be done to assist him to a fair and open trial. I knew him long before he went away as a Rhodes scholar: 1 know what his activities were on the other side, and since his return to Australia no one can say that he has not lived a successful and honorable life in the community. He claims that the public statements made in this chamber and published to the world really made him ;i criminal before he had an opportunity to say anything at all. He claims that he was one of seven among the sixteen internees of the movement who collectively signed a letter addressed to the Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde) in the following terms : -We the undersigned internees are refraining from appearing before the Advisory Committee established under regulation 26 (2) of the National Security Act because it is a secret tribunal.Then he goes on -Implying thereby that I, as one of the aforesaid seven internees who signed the said letter, desire to be publicly exonerated and exculpated from all suspicion of indictable offence or any offence, and I say further that the Minister for the Army exceeded the powers conferred upon him by the National Security Act in making public statements of his reasons for believing himself to be satisfied to have me interned and to keep me interned without affording me any opportunity of publicly denying or rebutting the said reasons, which were in any case fallacious and absurd, and for the reasons set out herein I say that I am wrongfully and illegally detained, interned and imprisoned.He claims that he is detained contrary to the intention of regulation 26 of the National Security Act, which requires that the Minister he properly, reasonably, and correctly satisfied in his mind that a person is guilty before making an order for his detention without trial. He complains that he appears in the records as a guilty person, and is so regarded by the public. He quotes in his letter, which has been sent to each of us, a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of a statement by the Minister for the Army to the following effect: -That tile Solicitor-General had advised that no further action be taken against persons interned in New South Wales until they had taken the opportunity, if they wished, of lodging appeals against their internment.He says that the Minister meant thereby that no charge would be laid against him in a court of law - and he has not yet been charged - until after he had been first interrogated by the secret Advisory Committee constituted under regulation 26 (2) of the National Security Regulations, and that such interrogation in secret of a person suspected or accused of crimes or offences, for the purpose of endeavouring to secure evidence which would bc used against him in a prosecution or indictment, or to persuade him to incriminate himself, is contrary to the law and practice of the Australian and British constitutions and not in conformity with the intention of Parliament in enacting the National Security Act. He submits that to attempt to clear himself in the manner suggested by the Solicitor-General would be to act to his disadvantage, and to the detriment of those associated with him. He asks that he be given an opportunity, such as was conceded to others in another State, to clear himself publicly in the minds of those who have been told through the Ministers statement in Parliament that he is guilty. I urge the Attorney-General, in view of the position that has been created, to give these people a chance to re-establish their names before Parliament and the public, and to clear themselves if they are not guilty.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

199,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ANTHONY, Hubert","JLZ","Richmond","N/A","N/A",55,". - - The remarks of the honorable member for Bendigo (Mr. Rankin) indicate that, in his mind, and doubtless in the minds of many other persons, certain individuals have already been prejudged, although no evidence of their guilt has been submitted other than the evidence of their arrest by Military Intelligence. The speech of the honorable member for Bendigo makes it necessary for the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) to have this matter determined with all possible despatch. I have no quarrel with the action of the Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde), in the first place, in ordering the detention of these men. That was his obvious duty, in view of the Japanese menace to Australia. What I do take exception to is the manner of the announcement of their arrest, because it prejudiced a fair trial of those citizens. I remind honorable members that any individual might possibly be arrested and imprisoned by the order of the government of the day, just as these men were, without trial, and merely on the advice ofMilitary Intelligence.I suggest to the Attorney-General that some distinction must be drawn between these cases, and the vast majority of internments. The Minister for the Army announced in this chamber that twenty members of the Australia First Movement had been arrested and that a conspiracy to assassinate certain prominent Australian citizens had been unearthed. Every member of the group who was arrested now carries the stigma of being associated with this assassination plot and with being a party to this conspiracy to overthrow the Commonwealth Government, regardless of whether he belonged to the Western Australian movement or to the New South Wales group. One of the things that seriously disturb those who value liberty and advocate a fair trial for an accused person is that an entirely different procedure was adopted in dealing with those who were arrested in Western Australia and those who were apprehended in New South Wales. One explanation for the differentiation was that more evidence had been collected against the accused in Western Australia. If that were so, it follows that less evidence was available against those who were arrested in New South Wales. Consequently, there was greater justification for taking prompt action to determine whether the members of the New South Wales group should be detained or released.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In such circumstances people would naturally wonder by what means he was released. Is that the position that exists? If it is it requires some clarification. I agree that there may be some cases where internment is warranted on the grounds of suspicion, but a person so interned should not be kept in camp for two, three or five months, as were the members of the Australia First Movement, and then released because the suspicions were unwarranted. I sincerely hope that the Attorney-General in his statement next week will completely clarify the position for the future. To a degree, I sympathize with the Minister for the Army for having been led in the way he was.

I think that the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has set out the position very fairly, and I shall endeavour not to touch upon the aspects to which he has referred, but I was asked why I made any statement in regard to these internments. I made the statement because several paragraphs had appeared in the newspapers that members of the Australia First Movement had been interned, and because the honorable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) asked on the 26th March -Will the Minister for the Army make a statement to the House upon the reported internment of members of the so-called Australia First Movement? In order to make it definite, I should like to know whether it is true that any members of that organization have been interned?After what had appeared in the newspapers, I considered it very likely that some question would be asked, and in addition to the report prepared for me by the Director of Military Intelligence for Australia, I telephoned to the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, in Melbourne, and discussed the whole matter with him. He was of opinion that in the national interest the statement should be made; but that it should not be broadcast or cabled overseas; and, consequently, the necessary censorship was applied to meet his wishes. I should like honorable members to bear in mind the atmosphere in Australia at that time, the middle of March, when every one considered that we were in imminent danger of invasion, when there was great apprehension everywhere, and when it was considered necessary to put the interests of the nation first. I should be one of the last members in this House knowingly to take any action that was unfair to any individual, or to deprive him of his freedom or of his rights as a British subject, but when we were in the throes of war, when there were definite statements that certain members of the Australia First Movement were engaged in subversive activities and definite recommendations to me as the responsibleMinister that they should be interned, I felt that it was my duty to approve the recommendation. On the 27th March the honorable member for War- ringah (Mr. Spender) when speaking on this subject, said -The entry of Japan into the struggle has made a substantial difference to the degree of proof required before an alien is interned. It seems to me that whereas previously some evidence was required before a person could be kept in internment, now the very least suspicion is sufficient justification for that action.The very least suspicion, he said, was sufficient justification for that action. He adopts a different attitude to-day. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) moved the adjournment of the House on that date, no doubt with the full approval of the Opposition, and went a good deal further than the Government would go in regard to internments. The Governments attitude was selective internment after very searching inquiries, and not mass internment. On the 27th March, it was thought that Australia was going to be invaded. It is all very well to adopt a different attitude when there have been victories in the Coral Sea, at Midway Island and at Milne Bay. Then there is a suggestion of  to the winds with all these restrictions and precautionary measures . But this is what the Leader of the Opposition said in this Parliament on the 27th March, 1942-The position of enemy aliens should be considered in parallel with the activities of the Australia First Movement. My considered opinion is that -Immediate action should be taken by the Government to intern aliens in Australia, excluding nationals of our allies and friendly nations.Effective measures should be taken to investigate and restrict the activities of female enemy aliens.An independent commissioner should be appointed to inquire into and report upon all naturalization certificates granted during the last five years.4 ) In cases where the commissioner finds any circumstance which he considers suspicious, the person concerned should be interned. Suspicious is the word he used. There were no half measures. The right honorable gentleman was referring to British subjects when he said,  The fact that they are naturalized is not sufficient for me; I want to have all these cases reviewed for the last five years . There was a general criticism that the Government was not going far enough in its internment policy. I admit that there was some division of opinion. The honorable member for Indi (Mr. McEwen) said -I endorse the action of the Government, and I am prepared to go so far as to say that no suspected person should be released from internment while there remain any grounds of suspicion against him.I was most careful in the course of my statement on the 26th March not to mention any names. The statement was worded in such a way as to indicate clearly that I did not imply that the subversive documents were found on all those who had been interned, but had been found in the possession of certain members of the Australia First Movement. The Military Intelligence decided as a precautionary measure, in view of certain evidence, to have all members of the Australia First Movement interned. The military authorities had been investigating this matter not for a day or a week, but for several months. The Deputy Chief of the General Staff considered that it was wise to make a statement to warn people that, before associating themselves with any movement, they should assure themselves of its bona fides, and it was not an organization which, under the cloak of a pleasing name, was engaging in subversive activities. At the time when these men were interned the position was very grave. They bad been detained because it was considered by Intelligence officers that that course was necessary in the interests of national security. We knew not when our country would be ravaged by the Japanese hordes. As I said at that time, I did not wish to prejudge the persons interned, but thought that they should be given an early hearing. All relevant papers were forwarded to the Solicitor-General who was asked to advise whether prosecutions should be launched against those believed to be involved, and the House was informed of that at the time. In my statement on the 27th March last I said -For that reason it is unwise to prejudge cases. There are processes of law open to those who consider that they have been wrongly interned. They are entitled to appeal for release and have their cases heard by a tribunal which has already been constituted.That was the tribunal set up by the present member for Warringah when he was Minister for the Army. I believe that he was roundly criticized by the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) in connexion with the setting up of some of these tribunals.Under the law as it stands to-day, any body who believes that he has been wrongly interned may apply to a tribunal which has already been constituted. There are two kinds of internment tribunals, one dealing with aliens and the other with British subjects. These are presided over by Supreme Court judges or ex-Supreme Court judges. I set out clearly what the procedure was as explained to me by the Solicitor-General, Sir George Knowles. All of the papers were referred to him, and upon his advice it was decided that the four persons who had been interned in Perth should be indicted. Voluminous documents had to be examined in Perth and in Sydney. Over 3,000 foolscap sheets of evidence had to be typed. Proceedings were instituted against the four persons in Western Australia and it was decided on the recommendation of the Solicitor-General that the others should not be prosecuted. The fact that a man has been interned does not mean that hp should be prosecuted under the Crimes Act; he should be permitted to appeal to the duly constituted tribunal. Two out of the four Western Australians were found guilty and imprisoned. The honorable member for Warringah knows that. He interned a large number of people when he was Minister for the Army, but he did not prosecute them. He set up a tribunal to hear their appeals in camera. At the time of the discussion in March he said that the slightest suspicion was sufficient to justify internment, but now he protests and suggests that something unfair has been done. I do not desire anything unfair to be done; I merely want justice done. It has been the policy of the present Government, and it was also the policy of the last Government, to intern suspected persons merely as a precautionary measure, to which recourse is had in order to prevent them from taking action prejudicial to the national interests. Many persons now interned have done nothing for which they could be charged in a court of law, but there were good grounds for deep suspicion. It is to prevent them from taking action that would be prejudicial, to public safety that they were interned. On the 26th March last I set out the procedure that would have to be adopted by these interned persons in order to have their cases heard by one of the tribunals. On the 2nd June only three of them had failed to appeal. Six of them lodged appeals and subsequently withdrew them. Then others, appealed and their cases were heard. The tribunal recommended that two of the internees be kept in custody and that five of them be discharged. The evidence on which the recommendations for internment were made was very bulky, and the preparation of the cases took some time. Instructions were given by me on several occasions that the work was to be completed without delay, even if additional staff had to be engaged. The appeals were heard late in June or early in July, and after due consideration the committee made its recommendations.Since then the Attorney-General has been made the Minister responsible for national security, following the appointment of the Director-General of Security, on my recommendation, in March last. A decision was made during the regime of the last Government that there should be a Director-General of Security under the Attorney-General, and that officer was appointed as the result of a recommendation made , by me to the Attorney-General. In addition to the compilation of dossiers in respect of each individual who had been interned, it was necessary to compile a general dossier on the movement which covered 3,000 pages. While this was being compiled work was continued night and day, and no obstacle was put in the way by mc as Minister. Nobody had greater regret than I that it was necessary to intern any member of the so-called Australia First. Movement who was known to be a British subject. I did not know any of them. My only concern was for the security of Australia. I therefore collaborated with the Solicitor-General and urged that the appeal cases be heard with the greatest possible expedition. For reasons that I have stated it was not possible to have the cases heard immediately. As the Attorney-General has said, there will be a Security conference on Saturday next. After my consultation with the Attorney-General that conference has been called. It will be attended not only by men at the head of Military Intelligence but also by those in charge of national security throughout Australia. We should have foremost in our minds the security of this country, but we wish to ensure that every man and woman shall have a fair deal. The Japanese were knocking at the door, as it were, at the time those internments were ordered. That was the atmosphere in March last when the honorable member for Warringah said that people should be placed in internment camps if the slightest suspicion rested on them. The Deputy Chief of the General Staff considered that there was ample evidence to justify the internments of these individuals at the time. I did not wish to prejudge them. As I have said, the machinery was available early in June to enable them to appeal. All but three of the internees appealed, and certain others withdrew their appeals. I am in favour of the others now appealing - something they should have done months ago. Any action taken by me was taken in the national interest on the recommendation of the highest military authority.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not interested in them or in their movement, but I am concerned that a Labour government, which has always preached the doctrine of fair play, and has stood for British justice, should allow persons to remain in gaol for over six months without a proper trial. It is amazing to think that the Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde) should admit that what prompted him to make the charges he did make were, first, that statements had appeared in the press regarding these people and, secondly, Australias imminent danger at the time.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

215,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROSEVEAR, John","L08","N/A","N/A","N/A",59,"- Wot even statements in newspapers or the danger confronting this country should cause a Labour Minister to interfere with the freedom of the people. At the time when he made his statement to the House the Minister had only one alternative - he should not have allowed these people to languish in gaol without a trial, but he should have arranged for their speedy trial. If there was any justification for his statement on that occasion that was all the more reason why the persons concerned should have been brought to trial without delay. In reply to a question asked by the honorable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) on the 26th March last, the Minister said -Documents and papers which have been seized purport to show that certain people in Australia intended to make contact with the Japanese army at the moment of an invasion of Australia. The documents set out deliberate plans for sabotage at vulnerable points in this country, and described methods calculated to make resistance to the Japanese impossible.The graver the danger to the country the greater the reason why these people should have been brought to trial immediately, in order that justice should be done. The Ministers statement on that occasion continued -Plans for the assassination of prominent people are set out.That statement prejudiced the possibility of a fair trial. It is true, as the Minister has said, that two courses are open to these internees : they may be tried before a specially constituted tribunal, or they may be tried under the Crimes Act. On the 27th March, the Minister said -Some British subjects were interned quite recently, and their cases are now under the consideration of the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, who will advise the Government as to what action should be taken. We hope to have a report from that gentleman in the near future, and, under the Crimes Act, those persons against whom it is believed that we have sufficient evidence, will be arraigned before a Supreme Court judge and jury for trial.Now we are told, in effect, that work in the Attorney-Generals Department proceeds so slowly that after six months the department is not in a position to proceed with the trial. I suggest now, as I suggested some time ago, that the real reason is that no charge which may be laid against these persons could succeed before an ordinary criminal tribunal. Certain persons in Western Australia have been tried and sentenced. Is there any reason why the persons in New South Wales who have been interned should not have been tried at the same time, more particularly if they had any real connexion with the persons tried in Western Australia? The Minister says that these persona have a tribunal open to them. I suppose that he knows that the methods adopted before that tribunal would not be tolerated in any ordinary court of law. Indeed, it was because some of the internees realized the futility of an appeal from Caesar to Caesar that they withdrew their appeals. This matter having been raised in the Parliament, I hope that the slur which has been cast on the Labour Government will be removed, and that these people will either be brought to trial speedily or released speedily. If we have to depend for their continued internment, on the evidence of men like the Crown witness in Western Australia, it is a sad lookout for justice in this country. Under cross-examination, that witness admitted that be was guilty of practically every crime in the calendar. In my opinion, nothing but a public trial of these persons will suffice, because should they be released by a tribunal, the stain on their character will not be erased, whilst should they be released as the result of agitation in this Parliament, it will be said that political pressure was brought to bear. The only proper course open to the Government is to have them tried publicly. If they then cannot clear their names, no penalty is too severe for them. If, however, they are innocent, they should be released and compensated for the injury that has been done to them. Moreover, should they be released because of their innocence, those who were responsible for misinforming the Minister concerning them should be dismissed from the Public Service.Question resolved in the affirmative.","Secret Meeting of Senators and Members - Days of Sitting - Order of Business -Australia First Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On the 27th July, 1942, a conference between representatives of National Oil Proprietary Limited and of fourteen unions was presided over by the Conciliation Commissioner and an agreement was arrived at. The effect of the agreement is that the ls. 6d. a day or 10s. 6d. a week granted by Judge OMara on the 4th May, 1942, to metal trades workers camping at Glen Davis is to be extended to all employees except shale-miners, whether or not they live in cubicles, tents or houses, to be known in future as a  locality  allowance. The company, on a suggestion by the Conciliation Commissioner, agreed not to make any further deductions of ls. 6d. a man a week for cleaning camp. The shale-miners will still receive the  special disability allowance  of 3s. 6d. a day or 17s. 6d. a week awarded to them by Judge Drake-Brockman as chairman of the Central Coal Reference Board.","Shale Oil Production : Workers at Glen Davis","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
