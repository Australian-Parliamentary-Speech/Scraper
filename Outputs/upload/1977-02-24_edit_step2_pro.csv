This followed a series of discussions I had had with iron ore producers and Australian coking coal exporters. The purpose of the discussion was to exchange points of view between Australia and the Japanese steel makers. The meeting was actually requested by Mr Tanabe so that he could inform us of the state of the Japanese steel industry. I also made use of the occasion to reiterate some things that I had said previously to the Japanese steel industry.  There has been some speculation in the Press that the Government may use its export control powers to ensure that satisfactory negotiations are carried out. I cannot see any need for this sort of speculation because it has been made quite clear by me and to the industry that the Government s policy is to have a monitoring role in these sorts of negotiations and that we want to see fair and reasonable prices given to the Australian industry. If, however, the national interest is not being protected of course the Government will intervene and take action. It is our wish that there be sensible commercial negotiations without the Government having to intrude in any way. Last year there was a series of negotiations to renew contracts and they were satisfactorily concluded as I hope they will be concluded this year. I will be very grateful if the Press does not interpret my remarks as a policy similar to that of the Labor Party because its policy was one of continual interference and indeed of carrying out negotiations which on many occasions were not in accord with the wishes of the industry.","JAPANESE STEEL DELEGATION","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I hope that the New South Wales Premier will be examining the circumstance in his own State to see why the New South Wales performance is significantly worse than that in other States.  It has been pointed out, I think on many occasions, that the policies of a State government in relation to a number of matters can have an important impact on business confidence within that State. It is not only Commonwealth Government policies that are involved. What has happened to New South Wales in the employment area since Mr Wran came to power cannot be very comforting to the people in that State.

I am sure we all wish him a speedy recovery. On a question that was raised yesterday and the question that the honourable member has now raised, I point out that the Governments visit visa policy and the procedures followed in implementing that policy are designed to ensure that the many thousands of genuine visitors throughout the world each year who seek to spend a short period in Australia receive their visas with a minimum of formality and delay. At present visit visas are being issued overseas at the rate of approximately 27S 000 per annum. Applicants for visit visas are required to complete a declaration which includes a question relating to any criminal record. The procedure provides that the cases of any applicants who indicate that they have a criminal record should be subjected to special inquiry prior to a visa decision. This applies also where overseas posts consider, on good grounds, that further inquiries should be made in relation to applicants who may have declared that they have no record.  The need for special inquiry arises only in isolated instances and this means that the many thousands of genuine visitor applicants are able to receive their visas without impediment. It would be unthinkable, even if it were practicable, that visa issues should be withheld in respect of all applicants to enable detailed checks concerning possible criminal records to be conducted. Individual cases do arise from time to time in which it is learned that a visitor who has entered Australia has a criminal record which he failed to disclose at the time of his application for a visa. The immigration powers enable the Minister to deal appropriately with any such cases which come to notice. As honourable members will be aware, the person referred to in questions asked yesterday has since been asked to leave.

In the fight against inflation I have not heard anyone suggesting that budget policy should be tighter, m other words that government expenditure should be cut further than it has been this year. I have not heard any suggestion that monetary policy should be any tighter than it is now. These 2 arms of policy are carrying as much burden in the fight against inflation as I think is reasonable and proper to put on them. External policy is now, as a result of measures that were taken late last year, also bearing an appropriate burden in this particular fight. But one element of policywages policy, which is not within the control of any Commonwealth government has not been bearing a sufficient share of the burden in the fight against inflation. It is not within the control of the Commonwealth to see that that happens because, whether it likes it or not, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is not merely a body whose function it is to settle industrial disputes. It has also by circumstance become a body which in fact determines policy in a significant area of importance for Australia and all Australians.  In Japan, for example, wages in I think the manufacturing industry sector increased by 1 1.8 per cent in the 12 months to September; in the 12 months to December in the United States of America they increased by 8.2 per cent; and in the 12 months to October in Canada they increased by 13.2 per cent, but in Australia they increased by 16.9 per cent over an equivalent period. This still means that wages have been increasing at a faster rate than that of a number of our significant trading partners. Under this circumstance the employment opportunities in Australia are bound to deteriorate unless that trend is reversed. The figures that I have just indicated make it quite plain that wages policy has not been carrying its share of the burden in the fight against inflation. In addition to that, it ought to be noted that the policies of tax indexation, the changed method of payment for family allowances, the tax cuts which come out of past decisions which will apply from 1 July and which come from tax indexation, materially affect total disposable income. It is not therefore merely a question of the wages or the rate of increase in wages that needs to be looked at in these matters. We have through tax indexation and the family allowances system established a circumstance where people ought to accept and I believe would accept a much greater degree of wage restraint than has occurred over the past 12 months. We have done this in a way in particular which has been designed to protect the lowest paid people in Australia through the revised method of payment of family allowances. We have established by our taxation policies the environment to make wage restraint reasonable and this ought to be understood. It ought to be understood that the policies we have already introduced will result in significant reductions in taxation from 1 July this year flowing out of the indexation decision. To answer the honourable gentlemans question, all this means that if Australia is to overcome her inflationary problem and if those who are out of work are to have the opportunity of gaining work, as I am sure the great majority of them would want to, a wages policy, together with Budget, monetary and external policies, needs to play an appropriate role in the fight against inflation. That, as honourable gentlemen know, does not depend upon a direct decision of this Government or of this Parliament; it depends upon a direct decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.","CONSUMER PRICE INDEX","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[14]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the honourable gentleman wants a recitation of them I will give it to him if he can bear with me. If one seeks an adjustment on the basis of the Medibank component to reflect the underlying rate of inflation, one finds that after adjustment for the Medibank change the consumer price index increased by 2.8 per cent in the December quarter last year compared with 6.3 per cent in the December quarter of 1975. If one seeks to put that on an annual basis, again after adjustment for the Medibank changes, the index increased by 10.8 per cent during the 12 months to the end of December 1976 compared with an increase of 16.7 per cent over the 12 months to December 1975. If one makes a similar adjustment allowing for Medibank and the impact of indirect tax charges which flowed through the system in the December quarter of 1 975, again a similar pattern is apparent. I point out to the honourable member for Adelaide that the underlying rate of inflation in the latter part of 1975 was not diminished by the decision to fund the cost of health care out of taxation. It will not be increased by the Medibank levy.  As to the future, there will of course be some increases in prices resulting from devaluation and they will be reflected in the March and June quarters. I remind the honourable gentleman that unlike his Government, which following devaluation in September 1974 took no action to offset the problems of price increases in the system, this Government has taken very firm offsetting action against the price flowon and the normal effects of a devaluation process. So far as the forward picture is concerned, the honourable gentleman knows very well that any forecast at this stage is so heavily and absolutely dependent upon the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that it would be a matter of rank irresponsibility to be putting down in this House a forecast for the rate of inflation over 1977.

My question relates to the method of taxing expenditure on replacement of fencing and other essential property items on farms, particularly where the fencing and property are insured. Is it a fact that a farmer who has had fencing destroyed in the fires and who receives insurance payments to cover the fencing is required to include those insurance payments as taxable income in the year of receipt? Is it also a fact that the farmer can depreciate the replacement cost of the fencing at only 4V4 per cent in the first year of replacement? If the answer to both those questions is in the affirmative, is the Treasurer aware of the tremendous financial difficulty that replacing destroyed fencing will impose on the farmers, particularly given that boundary fencing is an essential requirement on properties carrying livestock? If that is the situation, will the Treasurer take immediate steps to examine the matter with a view either to altering the method of taxing insurance receipts for fencing destroyed by the fires and/or permitting a full write off in the year in which the expense is incurred for replacing fencing so destroyed?

The matter of fencing has been taken up with the Commissioner of Taxation and I can assure the honourable gentleman that the provisions will not operate in the stringent manner which has been suggested in his question. Firstly, where insurance proceeds are received in respect of the loss of subdivisional fencing which has been subject to outright deductions for income tax purposes, I am informed that the proceeds will not be liable to income tax. I point out also that the cost of new fencing to replace those structures will now qualify for the 40 per cent investment allowance in addition to normal depreciation. In the case of boundary and other fences subject to ordinary depreciation, insurance funds will be regarded as assessable income but only to the extent to which they represent a recovery of depreciation already allowed. For example, a farmer who receives an insurance payment of $700 for a boundary fence that cost $1000, with a current written down value of $600, would be liable to $100 of assessable income. In other words, of the $700 insurance payment only $100 would be taxable. However, there is another option in the income tax law which I draw to the attention of the honourable gentleman. Farmers may elect to avoid liability to tax on any part of insurance proceeds by reducing the cost of the replacement fence on which depreciation is calculated. In other words, the tax adjustments can be spread over the full 30year period of depreciation. The Government is confident that these taxation arrangements will not cause cash problems for farmers who of course have been very hard hit by this tragedy and will enable them to meet their tax commitments as their farming operations become reestablished.

That stands in the policy on industry and it is clear for anyone to see. We have also of course instructed the IAC to report to us in relation to any recommendations that will result in reduced employment something which I think the previous Administration did not bother to do because if changes in protection are going to result in reduced employment it is a good idea either for the IAC or for the Government to have some view about where displaced people will find alternative employment. As a result of the decisions that were taken during the 3 years of Labor administration alternative employment opportunities are much fewer in this country than they otherwise would have been.  The matter that the honourable member referred to in my speech on 1 June on the world situation related to the very real circumstance in which a number of industrial countries which are close to major world markets much much larger than Australias have been promoting over the years lower and lower tariffs on manufactured goods but at the same time have been establishing almost impenetrable barriers for the goods of developing countries and for primary products. There is obviously a great divergence of view in the developed countries because of the way in which they treat manufactured goods and the way in which they treat other commodities. The attitude that I expressed then in relation to trade with the developing nations has been taken further in discussions in Jakarta and it finds reflection in the establishment of economic consultations between Indonesia, ASEAN countries and Australia consultations which I understand were suggested by the previous Administration in 1974 but which were not taken up until my visit to Jakarta last year. In addition to that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had further discussions on these matters when he was in Singapore and pointed to the need to establish the circumstance in which there can be greater trade for example between ASEAN countries and Australia. He also made the point that economic recovery needs to move further and employment opportunities need to improve more in this country before substantial moves can be made in that direction.","TRADE","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[17]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Unfortunately, the downturn in skim milk powder returns, in particular, over the last few years has meant that having built up assets over a period of some 70 years, the company is now, I understand, in receivership. For it to return to a solvent position would require the price of skim milk powder to be increased by approximately $300 a tonne. So the prospects for the plant are not bright at present. It is true that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has undertaken a survey of the area and I expect the results of that survey in about a fortnight s time. As a result of that survey it might be possible to devise ways by which some assistance can be given in determining the future for dairy farmers on the Island. It is really a very tragic situation because quite a large sum of money was spent in trying to upgrade the roller milk process towards spray drying. An application has been made for another sum of approximately $120,000 to complete the reequipment, yet the prospects of the plant seem such that it is hard to justify further expenditure.  I know that the honourable gentleman is concerned with the problems of those on the Island and has a genuine desire to find a way by which their present disastrous circumstances can be corrected. However, it is very hard to justify a further expenditure of money on the upgrading of the plant if the prospects for future economic use of that upgraded plant are negligible. There are currently 42 dairy suppliers to the factory, of whom most have alternative jobs. I think that one of the challenges arising from the report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the State and Federal Government analysis of it is to find alternative ways by which those dairy farmers can continue their way of life on King Island but return a more satisfactory income that the last few years have permitted. I commend the honourable gentleman for his attention to this problem.

PHILLIP LYNCH, M.P  INCOME EQUALISATION DEPOSITS PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN FIRE DEVASTATED AREAS The Treasurer, Mr Phillip Lynch, said today that primary producers whose properties had been burned out in the recent bushfires should not overlook the taxation benefits that may be available to them under the new scheme of income equalisation deposits. Mr Lynchexplained that the purpose of the income equalisation deposit scheme is to help primary producers smooth out the effects of fluctuating incomes. The scheme can therefore be used to avoid any abnormal effects on the current years income that the receipt of insurance proceeds or the proceeds of forced sales of livestock as a result of the fires might possibly have. A primary producer lodging money under the scheme is entitled to a tax deduction for the amount deposited, up to 40 per cent of the total income derived in the particular year from primary production activities. In calculating primary production income, the proceeds of forced sales of livestock and sums recovered under insurance policies for the loss of livestock or crops will be taken into account. Mr Lynchpointed out that all moneys placed on deposit earn interest at S per cent per annum without any discount in respect of the tax saved by the depositor by way of the deductions allowed under the scheme. Deposits, which can be withdrawn at any time after 12 months, are treated as assessable income for tax purposes when they are withdrawn. Within the 12 months period following a deposit the money can, however, be withdrawn only on grounds of hardship arising out of conditions not in existence at the time the deposit was made.

In particular, the study group was directed to report on proposals that the Government should consider establishment of a youth bureau and a youth advisory panel. The decision to establish the study group reflected the Governments concern with youth, and the adequacy of services for youth. During the course of its investigations the study group met with and received submissions from representatives of Commonwealth, State and local governments, voluntary organisations, youth workers and young people.  The study group concluded that young people warranted consideration as a group with special needs by governments and other organisations. It suggested that there are a number of trends which affect youth in complex ways and deserve more careful attention. These include smaller families, higher female work force participation rates, longer periods of formal education, the employment markets emphasis on accreditation, the increased affluence of many members of the community, and changing life styles. The study group saw an urgent need for improving the machinery for coordinating and developing youth policy and coordinating the delivery of services to youth. It believes that in the future greater emphasis should be placed on meeting the particular needs of youth in general community programs, rather than developing more specific youth programs and services. The study group believes that there are important long term social and economic trends which have significant implications for young people and for the appropriateness of government programs and services provided to them. These trends and their implications need to be assessed more effectively. There should be improved coordination and consultation between the Commonwealth departments and better communication and consultation with young people. Mr Speaker,the Government has noted the report and has taken a decision to establish an office of youth affairs within the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. The office will have direct access to the Minister on matters of youth policy and its functions will be: To seek greater coordination and consultation between Commonwealth departments in relation to Commonwealth Government programs and proposals affecting youth; to seek greater coordination and consultation with State governments, local governments and nongovernment agencies in relation to Commonwealth programs or proposals affecting youth; to build up a research and information capacity to complement and increase the effectiveness of similar activities in functional departments; to advise on youth needs to assist those designing specific and general programs and services, and build up a channel for better communication with youth. The Government has also decided to establish a standing task group on youth affairs, comprising senior officials of relevant departments and including a representative of the new Office of Youth Affairs. This task group will operate within the Cabinet committee system to ensure proper departmental consultation in the development of new policy proposals or proposed changes to existing programs which bear significantly on government services to youth. It will provide a link between the office, other departments, and to Ministers. The concerns raised by young people through the Office of Youth Affairs will be more readily brought under full consideration by these means. The Government has asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) to investigate further the question of a youth advisory council or panel and report to it after the Office has been operating some 6 or 1 2 months. It is essential that the new Office be staffed in part by young persons, or others with special experience and skills, drawn from outside the Service. Accordingly, the aim will be to seek an appropriate balance between career Public Service appointments, and staff engaged on a shortterm basis from outside the Service having regard to the particular requirements of the Office. Mr Speaker,I believe that the Governments establishment of the Office of Youth Affairs and the standing task group demonstrates its resolve to keep in close touch with youth needs and issues and to see that its own programs serve young people more effectively.

We on this side would support any action taken by the Government which does something of a positive nature for the youth of this nation, because we believe that if there is one section of the Australian community now suffering from the present economic constraints imposed by the Fraser Government it is the young people of this nation. For instance, the unemployment figures show that something like 44 per cent of those unemployed are under the age of 21 years. Of the total number of unemployed in the country at the end of January this year some 156 000 were juniors. Although our youth represent only 1 1.2 per cent of the work force, they account for 44 per cent of those unemployed in the work force.  Let us look at particular areas of Australia. For instance, one report reveals that in the non metropolitan areas, particularly in the rural areas of New South Wales, some 600 applications were made for every job vacancy registered at the labour exchange. In the western suburbs of Sydney, and in particular the position at the labour exchanges in Granville, Blacktown and Parramatta, the position is that in Granville 3320 people are unemployed, and of that number 1 56 1 or 47 per cent are under the age of 2 1 years. Of that number 657 are females. The position in the Blacktown area, which is represented by my colleague the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage), is even worse. Of the 3484 people unemployed, 1948 or 55.9 per cent are under 21 years of age of which 885 are females. The position in Parramatta is that 51.5 per cent of those unemployedthe number of unemployed is not as high in that area are under the age of 2 1 years. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out the unemployment figures for the western suburbs of Sydney.","Report and Ministerial Statement","STUDY GROUP ON YOUTH AFFAIRS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Circumstances have developed to such an extent, because of the broad brush approach the Government has taken to the whole economy. Because of this attitude the youth of this nation are suffering most. I wish to refer to a survey made by the Brotherhood of St Laurence and which is summarised in the submission of the Australian Council of Social Services. It reads: the longterm consequences of young people being unemployed over a long period are stated as: (a ) Loss of faith in society and government. (b)Development of antiwork attitudes. (c)Development of habits that would mitigate against future employment. (d)Damage of feelings of selfesteem. (e)Family tensions arise as young people fail to get employed. (f)Trouble with the law. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, larceny and vandalism is a potential development. (g)Getting used to managing on benefits and seeing no advantage in working for a slightly higher income in a routine job when they have no particular skill to sell. Because of the position this Government has taken in economic strategy, that is the position in which the great bulk of the youth of this nation find themselves today. The question I ask the House is this: Is the report which has been tabled by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) a smokescreen or is the Government really concerned about the youth of the nation?

The Government is going to draw money away from the wage earners and is going to direct it to big business, many of which are powerful foreignowned interests. That is the psychology of this Government. There were programs that were effectively assisting the youth of our nation. For instance, programs under the Department of Tourism and Recreation, for which the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart) was Minister when we were in government, made $6m available for recreation and sporting facilities for Australians, particularly the young, in each of the last 2 financial years in which Labor governed. But these programs were scuttled immediately the present Government came into office although it agreed to admit some of the outstanding commitments. Another program that has been scuttled of course, opposition has come from even the Government back benchers for this move is the Australian Assistance Plan.

They want to brand the numbers on the backs of the young people, the same as is done to criminals, or on the chest, as is done to people in the Army! The article continues to state that this:  .. would aim to prevent people using false names and concealing earnings. The suggestion, which has been implemented in North America and some European countries, attracted considerable interest at todays weekly meeting of the Government Parties during a debate of more than two hours on the economy. Concern over  dole bludgers  and ways of clamping down on them was expressed repeatedly in speeches by back benchers. That illustrates the real philosophy the real attitudeof this Government and its supporters. It does not want really to try to solve the grave social problems involved. We all know of the record level of unemployment in this country. Unemployment has never been higher. Over 40 per cent of those unemployed are people under 2 1 years of age. As I said, in certain areas, particularly the western suburbs of Sydney and country areas, the position is much worse. I do not believe that the establishment of an office of youth affairs in any way provides an answer to the problem. I might say that even the Prime Minister, in tabling the report, said: .. There are important long term social and economic trends which have significant implications for young people . . . There are long term implications for young people. These are grave and widespread, particularly in the western world. There have been plenty of indications of high levels of unemployment and these high levels are being compounded. A study undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is the club of the rich western countries, has indicated that unemployment in most of the 26 countries represented in the Organisation, of which Australia is one, will stay at the higher levels of 1974 for at least the next S years. The study indicated that this will be the case even if inflation is brought under control and economic recovery is efficiently managed. Clearly a brave approach has to be adopted by the Government today to solve the problem of the youth of this nation. No action has been taken by this Government. The mentality of the Government and its back benchers which calls the young people of this nation dole bludgers has to stop. We have to have confidence in the young people. Young people have lost faith in we old people. We have to have a better understanding of them. There can be no doubt that the young have lost a great deal of faith in the older people of the nation. We notice also from the statement made by the Prime Minister that after 6 months or 12 months the Government will set up a youth advisory council. Why does not the Government involve the youth in the early stages and find out what they want. Why does the Government need to involve only old senior bureaucrats from within the Australian Public Service at this stage? Unless the Government understands and involves the young people, who really are suffering psychologically, there will be no solution to this problem and the office of youth affairs will achieve nothing. I say quite clearly to the Government and to all members of this Parliament: Let us drop this term dole bludgers; let us start to have some faith in and some respect for the young people of this nation. If we do we might be able to get better cooperation from them. Above all, this Government must look at its economic policies because the deep rooted line that it has taken in its policies is the thing that is creating the real problem for young people. I believe that that is the most basic cause of the problem. Let us solve the problem and at the same time let us adopt a more humane attitude. Let us try to reintroduce some of the policies that were carried out under the Labor Government. Let us not scrap the AAP program or the recreation and other programs until we have better programs to put in their places. I believe that if we do scrap those programs there will be a great deal more suffering in this community.

He has given the most distinguished service to the Army, to the Services ana to the country. General Hassett has served for 42 years. He has earned the respect and admiration of all those who served with him.  He saw operational service in World War II and in the Korean War. He also served with the Commonwealth Infantry Brigade Group in Malaya. As the principal military adviser to the Government, General Hassett has been obliged to discharge great responsibilities. He has done that with significant success. He has been informed that a continued acceptance of those responsibilities could well jeopardise his health.

We feel that his appointment by the previous Labor Government was a wise appointment, and that has been endorsed by the comments that have been made by the Minister for Defence this morning. I mention that fact because of its significance as evidence of the way in which Sir Francis Hassett has been able to serve this country and the governments of this country regardless of their political complexion. In the period in which he held high office while we were a government, I am aware, from comments made by colleagues as Ministers for Defence, that Sir Francis Hassett s contribution intellectually and his physical energy and determination to achieve results were invaluable. Many of the important changes which took place in the structure and functioning of the defence Services during the period we were in government were contributed to valuably and directly in many cases by Sir Francis Hassett. The Australian community has been fortunate in having a military officer of such great distinction and dedication serving it for so long. It is the sincere trust of members of the Opposition that his retirement will be pleasant and fruitful.  I think it appropriate on this occasion also to welcome the appointment of LieutenantGeneral MacDonald to succeed Sir Francis Hassett.

It is a scheme for which the Labor Government twice sought to legislate while in office; it is based on an exhaustive inquiry commissioned by my Government; and it springs from a longstanding and specific undertaking by the Labor Partyto the Australian people. It is not, however, from mere attachment to the Labor Governments programs that I bring in this Bill. I commend it to honourable members as an historic and overdue social reform. It deserves the support of all parties. It will mean significant savings for the majority of Australians, and for those who are the victims of tragic accident or misfortune it will bring a measure of justice and security which has never been possible under the law as it stands.  Put simply, everyone in the community will receive protection and the whole community will save money. There will in any case be a substantial reduction in the crippling costs of motor vehicle thirdparty and workers compensation insurance. These costs are an evergrowing and inescapable burden on every vehicle owner and employer in Australia. They are an intolerable burden on the States. By means of this Bill that burden will be eased and its enormous inflationary effect will be curbed. In place of the cumbersome and complex system of compulsory insurance schemes administered and enforced under various state and territory laws, the Bill proposes a national rehabilitation and compensation scheme to provide benefits in the most equitable and efficient manner. By reducing administrative costs, by spreading the burden of cost evenly and fairly throughout the community, a great reduction in charges and a vastly improved system of benefits will be possible. At present any victim of a motor vehicle or industrial accident faces delay, uncertainty and hardship before his claim is met or even considered. The compensation eventually granted may be inadequate or arbitrary. Many deserving victims and their families may get nothing at all. The system is uncertain, dilatory, costly and riddled with anomalies.","Second Reading","NATIONAL REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

No one denies that reform of the existing system will present complex technical and administrative problems. Equally, no one can deny that a solution to the spiralling cost of compulsory insurance must be found, and found quickly. The problem is urgent. Other countries have tackled it successfully with schemes broadly similar to the one I propose. I do not want to rehearse here the record of obstruction and delay, from inside and outside the Parliament, which frustrated Labors original proposals. It is sufficient to say that my Bill in its present form offers the best possible basis for a workable national scheme. The Parliament has already had ample opportunity to consider the broad principles behind it. My Government submitted our original Bill to the widest possible public and parliamentary scrutiny. It was based on a report of the Rt Hon. Sir Owen Woodhouse, of the New Zealand Court of Appeal and now of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the Hon. Mr Justice C. L. D. Meares, of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the Chairman of the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped and until recently Chairman of the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales. That report was received in July 1974 and tabled in the Parliament; legislation was introduced in this House on 3 October 1974; before it was given a second reading in the Senate it was referred to the Senates Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. Certain provisions of the Bill were revised and improved; further improvements and refinements are incorporated in the Bill now before us. The Woodhouse Committee proposed a new deal for every Australian whose life had been disrupted by injury or illness. This Bill will provide that new deal. No member on either side has denied the importance or urgency of the problem.

I could quote similar statements from Premiers and other Liberal spokesmen. The need for a comprehensive scheme was pressing when the Woodhouse Committee was first appointed to inquire. It is now imperative. The Parliament will be failing in its duty if it shirks the problem any longer.  The central flaw in the existing schemes is not just their exorbitant cost to the community but their total inadequacy as a system of social justice. Their faults can all be traced to the excessive legalism surrounding any system of compulsory state insurance. What ought to be a measure of social welfare has become a commercial procedure dictated by calculations of profit and loss. What ought to be a willing social responsibility for the injured and the sick has become a legal contest between adversaries. Where society should be primarily concerned with the welfare of the accident victim and his family it is more concerned with legal concepts of evidence, negligence and fault. The accident victim cannot be sure that he will receive compensation, nor what amount to expect. If no question of fault or negligence arises a victim is often without any compensation at all. The whole process of trial before a court is costly and humiliating in itself. The payment of damages as a lump sum opens the way to glaring anomalies in the amounts received By different people. Lumpsum payments are also vulnerable to inflation and leave the victim with no guarantee of a steady, regular income during the period of incapacity, let alone for life. Moreover, the need for insurance companies to calculate their premiums against a risk of massive lump sum payments vastly increases the cost of insurance. The entire system is wasteful, inefficient and unjust. There is no dispute about the cost of accidents to society in human and economic terms. More than 90 000 Australians were injured on the roads in 1975; there were 228 000 industrial accidents. How many victims received any or adequate compensation, let alone rehabilitation, is a matter for speculation. To receive any form of compensation the victim must first determine the appropriate system for recovery. Depending on where, when and how an injury occurs, a victim may have an action for damages at common law, or be entitled to workers compensation, or be entitled to nofault motor accident benefits if he is injured in Victoria or Tasmania, or come within the scope of a criminal injuries compensation scheme, or be eligible for social security payments. On the other hand the victim may find himself, or herself, outside all these schemes and left to bear the entire loss alone or with the assistance of charity. The benefits, particularly the maximum amount recoverable, do not relate to the needs of the individual but depend on the particular scheme he happens to fall under at the time of the injury. Each State and Territory has different provisions in its different schemes, and each provides for different maximum amounts of compensation. Each scheme contains its own anomalies and exceptions. In short, the one certainty in the present schemes is that every vehicle owner and employer must pay for them. The great uncertainty is whether victims will receive any benefits. Although third party insurance is compulsory and universal, it does not provide automatic cover in all road accidents, and even people who are covered are unsure of their entitlements. There is no compensation for accident victims who suffer injuries by themselves without the involvement of another party. The fact that insurance companies indemnify motorists does not mean that liability for accidents is accepted without negligence being proved. The actual amount of liability or damages becomes the essence of the court battle. Thus all the costs, waste and dissipation of resources which accompany court trials are preserved in the system. Third party claims are never settled quickly even if there is no doubt as to liability. The injured party must face and meet his loss without recompense in the short term. He must pay all expenses and, if unable to work, suffer the resulting wage loss while his claim is processed. This often results in severe economic hardship. The delay in receiving recompense is longer in proportion to the seriousness of the injury. Thus severely injured victims, whose need for economic security is greater because of the long term nature of their incapacity, are obliged to wait until medical opinion is final before their claim is settled. This process takes a minimum of 3 years for onethird of permanently disabled claimants. In New South Wales, after 5 years, 1 3 per cent of those permanently disabled are still unpaid. Somehow the injured party is expected to survive this greater economic burden without any form of income. The situation is inhuman. Third party accident insurance simply ensures that funds are available to pay for injuries caused on the roads. It is not an accident compensation scheme; it merely underwrites motorists liable to be sued. This is not a satisfactory system for the victim and it is cripplingly expensive to the community. The public is overburdened in enforced payments of road accident insurance. Every State parliament levies a tax on every automobile owner. In every State the premiums are usually increased at least once a year. The spiral is unending. As inflation pushes compensation payments higher and higher, insurance premiums are forced to rise so that reserves will be sufficient to meet demands. Already there is grave doubt as to the sufficiency of private insurers reserves. In sheer economic terms, leaving aside the compelling social and human arguments for a national rehabilitation and compensation scheme, the present costly system must be reorganised and rationalised for the benefit of the whole community. If we remember that roughly twothirds of the Australian population are eligible to drive motor vehicles, and more than half those people own private motor vehicles, we can see the extent of the thirdparty burden on ordinary Australians. A comparison of the 1974 and 1976 compulsory third party insurance premium rates illustrates the dramatic rise in costs to the motorist. In New South Wales in 1974 the premium charged on third party insurance for an ordinary motor car was $40, in March 1 976 it was $83, now it is $93. In Victoria in 1974 it was $65, in March 1976 it had jumped to $91.50, it is now $111. In Queensland in 1974 third party insurance cost $26.50 per motor car, in 1976 it was $40 (although only $12 to farmers and graziers). In South Australia the premium was $45 in 1974; it has just gone up to $89 for private cars. In Western Australia it was $27.60 in 1974; in 1976 it was $42. In Tasmania the premium in 1974 was a mere $12 per car; in 1976 it had risen to $56. All motor vehicle insurance premiums in Australia have doubled or quadrupled in the last 3 years in the 3 years since this proposal was tabled in the parliament. Under this Bill, every vehicle owner in Australia would pay less than he is compelled to pay at present. Underwriting losses totalled $1 19m in 197475. This loss was incurred when claims for the period totalled $181m. The total amount of claims estimated for 197576 is $3 10m, an increase of 71 per cent. Premiums collected have increased by over $100m or 36 per cent. The total loss on this insurance may therefore be as high as $200m a year. Employers liability insurance schemes are also compulsory in every State and Territory. As with third party insurance, when liability is disputed there is a court battle with all the attendant costs, delays and uncertainty. There are 10 workers compensation schemes in Australia The maximum weekly compensation payments on total incapacity of an employee without dependants ranges from $56.30 in Queensland to $73 in Victoria; in Western Australia the amount payable is equal to the employees weekly earnings and in South Australia and Tasmania it is his average weekly earnings over the previous 12 months. An employers maximum total liability for dependants on the death of an employee ranges from $27,616 in Western Australia to $19,750 in Queensland. Why should a widow in Queensland be left $8,000 worse off than a widow in Western Australia? Amounts payable for partial incapacity arising from workrelated injuries are extraordinarily varied. Let me illustrate: For total loss of sight or loss of both eyes the maximum amount of compensation payable to an employee in New South Wales is $13,500; in Western Australia it is $37,253. In Queensland maximum compensation for total deafness is $8,400; in Western Australia it is $27,939; in Tasmania it is $ 10,2 1 5; and in the Australian Capital Territory $15,387. For the loss of a foot, compensation is payable to Western Australians of $27,939, while a foot is valued at only $7,290 in Queensland and $8,000 in New South Wales. Under this Bill every employer in Australia would pay less than he is compelled to pay at present. The present schemes, however, do not cover anything like the entire work force. The largest groups not covered are employers themselves and the self employed. No workrelated injury benefits flow to the small businessman when he suffers in the course of his work. Nor does workers  compensation extend to independent contractors, those employed on an irregular basis, or volunteer workers for charities and religious institutions. The Old Testament formula of an eye for an eye is plainly more equitable that the present jackpot system of compensation in Australia I have said enough to point up the anomalies and high costs to individuals in the present schemes. I turn now to the savings which Labors proposals would achieve. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) has just supplied me with official figures which show vividly the waste and extravagance built in to the existing system. I believe they will be incorporated in todays Hansard in answers to questions on notice. In 197475, $575m was collected in workers compensation premiums and $2 73m was disbursed in benefits, and $306m was collected in third party premiums and $191m was disbursed in benefits. I ask the House to consider the staggering proportion of the total cost of the present schemes accounted for by administration expenses and commissions. The Insurance Commissioners latest report demonstrates that administration expenses and commission paid for third party and workers compensation in 197475 were more than $110m. In the case of workers  compensation alone the amount of contributors  premiums eaten up by administrative costs and commissions reached the enormous sum of $96m, compared with benefits paid of $2 73m. In other words the overhead costs of workers compensation are onethird of the amount paid to accident victims. The actual compensation to victims would be less than the amount of $2 73m, since that figure includes their legal, hospital and medical expenses. How long must the Australian people put up with this sort of efficiency? The need for reform is inescapable. Labors scheme would reduce this wasteful burden quickly and dramatically. The savings under Labors proposals were estimated by officers of a departmental working party appointed by my Government in 1974. They made a thorough, expert and impartial examination of the costs. The report was tabled in the House on 28 October 1975 and its conclusions have never been questioned or denied. The working party included officers of the Treasury, the Social Welfare Commission and the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet and Repatriation and Compensation. They calculated that under Labor s proposals vehicle owners would have paid $135m in 197576 for thirdparty insurance instead of the $240m they had to find under the existing State scheme a saving of $105m. Employers would have paid about $340m under our scheme for workers compensation instead of the $460m they paid under State schemes a saving of $ 120m. Moreover, the payments amounting to between $ 100m and $ 1 50m which are at present made by way of voluntary insurance, social security, repatriation, sick leave and superannuation would be unnecessary under the scheme proposed by the Bill. The total saving to the community estimated by the working party, would, therefore, have been between $325m and $375m in 197576 $lm a day and in this financial year the saving would be far greater. The estimated savings in administration costs and commissions are particularly striking: For third party insurance, $15m under present schemes, $4m under this; for workers compensation, $105m under present schemes, $8m under this. The figures speak for themselves, and I repeat: They have never been challenged. I ask leave to incorp orate in Hansard the table from which I have b een quoting.","Second Reading","NATIONAL REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

(d)Hospital and Medical Expenses covered by Medibank at a cost of $35m work, $25m road (197576 prices). I thank the House. And when we think about it, why should the figures surprise us? Plainly any federal government can administer such a scheme more economically than States or private bureaucracies. It already has the machinery and the experience to do so. All the methods of financing the scheme recommended by the working party, the section of its report dealing with the feasibility of a riskrelated tax on employers was the work of the Australian Government Actuary and officers of the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They recommend that the collection of payments by employers should be the responsibility of the Commissioner of Taxation. What could be more obvious? The federal government has had 60 years experience of making periodic payments in the case of age and invalid pensions and more than 60 years in the case of veterans. The cost of collection under Labors scheme would be almost nil and the costs of making payments would be minimal. Before describing the essential features of our scheme, a word about experience overseas. New Zealand and various states and provinces of the United States of America and Canada have all acted to relieve the social and economic costs of accident compensation. In 1966 New Zealand first acted on the recommendations of a royal commission chaired by Sir Owen Woodhouse who, of course, was the chairman of the committee upon which the present scheme is based. In 23 years of office LiberalCountry Party governments in Australia failed to heed the example set by other governments and failed to take any action of their own. They failed to recognise the hardship and injustice imposed on accident victims by the antiquated common law system. My Party in 1971 adopted the policy of establishing a national compensation insurance scheme to replace third party and workers compensation, and guarantee families and individuals a minimum income sufficient to maintain an acceptable standard of living. In March 1973 Mr Justice Woodhouse was again commissioned, this time by my Government, to report upon the scope and form of a nationwide system of rehabilitation and compensation for all injured persons. This Bill, based substantially on that report, provides a scheme by which Australian residents will receive automatic earningsrelated benefits when they are injured or incapacitated either temporarily or permanently from any cause. The injury may have been received at any place and at any time. When the scheme is in operation any employee or any person will be eligible for compensation for incapacity as a result of personal injury, providing that person is over the qualifying age and meets certain broad residence requirements. Personal injury includes any physical or mental disability or damage and certain illnesses contracted as a result of the personal injury or in the course of employment. The benefit proposed is a weekly sum in respect of all incapacities. The sum for total incapacity is calculated on a percentageup to 85 per cent of the weekly earnings of the applicant immediately before his injury. The scheme is to be administered by a government department. There is to be no contest over proving liability, no lawyers and no judge or jury. A social welfare policy administration will assess claims and provide benefits and allowances. The administration will also deal with the rehabilitative aspect of the scheme. It will set safety and health standards and coordinate activities across the full range of the social welfare area. In other words, the scheme does away with the common law system of onceandforall, lumpsum assessments of damages. Lumpsum awards preclude speedy settlement of claims as the final cost of the injury is often not determined for years. They also fail to take into account the effects of inflation or any deterioration in the victim s condition. Under the scheme in the Bill benefits will be continually reviewable. All benefits will be automatically adjusted in accordance with rises in the consumer price index. Minor personal injuries and severe facial or bodily disfigurement may be compensated by way of lumpsum payment. Other benefits include sums to dependent relatives and children of deceased persons and the payment of funeral expenses. Let there be no talk of handouts and extravagances under this scheme. As I have shown, it will save money, not waste it. Even if there were no savings the scheme would be a vast improvement on what we have now. The removal of injustice, uncertainty and delay is a compelling reason for reforming the present cumbersome structure in one way or another. I put it forward as a general proposition that any form of insurance, indeed any community activity that is compulsory for everyone by law, is best administered in uniform fashion by a government agency established for that purpose. This scheme and Labors Medibank scheme are based on the same principle. That principle is the need to establish the most rational, just, humane and efficient procedures to administer any social welfare scheme from which the whole community benefits and to which the whole community is obliged to contribute. The present system of compulsory State workers compensation and third party insurance, like the Fraser Governments compulsory health insurance, are intrinsically extravagant and inefficient. Medical and hospital treatment have to be paid for, but the present State workers compensation and third party insurance schemes and the present Federal health insurance scheme make medical and hospital treatment unnecessarily expensive for patients and taxpayers. In Australia the Federal Government is the government best suited to establish the new procedures. A uniform national scheme is selfevidently the best way to eliminate costs, overlap and duplication, and to reduce the administrative overheads entailed in scores of different, competing companies. The States know the social and economic shortcomings of the present system but there is little they can do on their own, for they do not have the apparatus to collect the revenue or to disburse the benefits. As in all such reforms it is imperative that the initiative should come from the Federal Government. It has the opportunity and the duty to give a lead. It has the constitutional power. The SolicitorGeneral, Mr Byers, has given an opinion that the scheme we propose is fully within the limits of the Commonwealths authority. In my experience every opinion Mr Byers has given, on legislation or in administration, has been upheld by the High Court. There has never been a successful challenge to any Bill or any action which he has advised. The whole thrust of policy under this Government has been to devolve upon the States responsibilities which are properly and traditionally those of the Federal Government. In all this the objective is not so much to bring administration closer to the people or to involve the community in programs of local or regional concern. That m itself would be a proper objective and one supported by the Labor Party. What the Fraser Government has sought to do is reverse the historic consensus of a generation of Australian politics, the principle adhered to by successive Labor and Liberal governments, ever since the Second World War that the prime responsibility for social welfare and security, and for all reforms and initiatives in this field, rests with the Federal Government. As I pointed out last week, that was the underlying motive of the Government in appointing the Bailey and Holmes inquiries into aspects of social welfare. Even the Bailey report, while recommending that the States should have the primary role in operating schemes for rehabilitation, nevertheless proposes that the Commonwealth retain a policy, evaluating and funding role. In any national rehabilitation and compensation scheme worthy of the name, that should be the minimum role for the Federal Government. No Federal Government can in justice ignore its obligation to explore and develop a new system of compensation and rehabilitation, in consultation with the States and the interests concerned, and remove the intolerable shortcomings of the system as it now stands. I believe that the scheme proposed in this Bill is in principle and detail the best that can be devised. How long must the people wait? How long must justice be denied? I commend the Bill to the House.","Second Reading","NATIONAL REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[17]","N/A","N/A"

Whitlam) has indicated his Partys approach to the reform of the compensation systems in Australia. I now intend to outline how the Government proposes to approach this matter. There is a fundamental agreement on many aspects of a national compensation program. In 1973 the previous Government established a committee of inquiry into rehabilitation and compensation in Australia under Mr Justice Woodhouse of New Zealand. Mr Justice Woodhouse of course had previously headed a royal commission of inquiry in New Zealand which ultimately resulted in the introduction of an accident compensation scheme in 1974. The committees report was tabled in the Australian Parliament in July 1974 and it included a draft national compensation Bill. That Bill was modified, introduced into Federal Parliament and passed by the House of Representatives in October 1974. In the same month the clauses of the BUI were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. The Committee reported to Parliament in July 1975, raising many objections to the Bill. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, the then Government was in the process of reviewing the Bill when Parliament was dissolved in November 1975. Enormous efforts would have been required, however, before the scheme could have been regarded as generally acceptable and workable. For instance, the scheme was not supported by all sections of the community. Its financial and economic implications had not yet been fully resolved. The States did not support all the proposals and the constitutional validity of the proposed authorising legislation was also in question. In view of these difficulties the new Government decided not to proceed with the Bill.  Before outlining the weaknesses which exist in the current compensation system it is necessary to describe the present position. The existing systems which provide monetary benefits to those who suffer incapacity as a result of personal injury or who are dependent on or related to a person killed as a result of personal injury include common law, including fatal accidents legislation, workers compensation, nofault motor accident compensation, criminal injuries compensation, air accidents liability, social security, superannuation, sick leave and private loss insurance. Many of these systems fall within the jurisdiction of the States, although the lack of rationalisation results in unnecessary expenditure and produces difficulties for victims. Some of these have been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. The weaknesses which led to the Woodhouse inquiry still exist. I shall outline some of them as we see them. Most selfemployed persons are not covered by workers compensation. This group is estimated to comprise over 10 per cent of the work force. There is a lack of uniformity as to benefit structures, entitlements and administrative practices. For example, unlike the rest of the Australian working population, 20 to 30 per cent of workers in Victoria and New South Wales do not receive weekly compensation of 100 per cent of award wagesin the first 26 weeks of injury. Over 30 per cent of motor accident victims, due to the absence of negligence on someone elses part, are unable to sue for damages at common l aw. However, there would be an entitlement for hospital and medical expenses under health insurance arrangements, as well as income maintenance for short term injuries under sick leave provisions. Settlements of common law damages are slow. Damages are reduced by contributory negligence irrespective of the needs of the injured person and are adversely affected by inflation because they are paid in a lump sum. There have been high losses by State government insurance offices and private insurers in both workers compensation and third party fields. Premiums charged to employers for workers compensation insurance and to motorists for compulsory third party insurance, which amount to over $ 1,000m a year, have become a real burden and further increases will be necessary. Some relief is provided to employers, however, by allowing these premiums as tax deductions.

Investigations have been instituted to develop options for alternatives to the Woodhouse scheme. The Governments objective is to have a joint examination by Commonwealth and State Governments of options that are available, together with an investigation of the implications of establishing a national compensation program. It is becoming increasingly evident that State governments are very concerned at the trends in and the inadequacies of existing compulsory workers compensation and third party insurance systems. The Commonwealth Government is prepared to give full consideration to options to improve the systems. All the States are concerned at the increasing cost of compensation. In Victoria in particular a judicial committee has been appointed to inquire into both workers compensation and compulsory third party insurance, with very extensive terms of reference. The role of the Commonwealth, which appears to be of much interest to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House generally, falls within the terms of reference of the inquiry.  In addition to working with the States to make the systems more efficient financially, the Commonwealth would like to see adequate incomerelated protection for the income earner who is unable to work because of personal injury, irrespective of when or where the injury occurred or whether the injured party was at fault. This, together with improvements in safety and availability of early rehabilitation, is seen as an important adjunct to the Governments industrial relations platform. The present Government regards rehabilitation of the disabled as an essential feature of any compensation program. In its consultations with the States and with other interested bodies on the development of a program, due emphasis has been given to this important matter. The insurers represented by the National Compensation Insurance Industry Committee have expressed particular concern about the provision of adequate rehabilitation services and are willing to assist in their development. The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service is the largest and most comprehensive vocational rehabilitation service in Australia. It is only one of such services operating on a national basis. Its rehabilitation centres are specially equipped to provide balanced programming for remedial treatment and vocational assessment. In 197576 the Commonwealth rehabilitation service program cost $1 1.5m. So far as research is concerned, the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped and the Department of Social Security are conducting or financially assisting research into various aspects of rehabilitation. NACH continues in its role as adviser to the Government on all facets of rehabilitation. The Government also believes that safety must be a first priority in the development of any compensation program, and the role of safety will continue to be stressed in discussions with the States and other interested groups. The National Compensation Insurance Industry Committee has already indicated that the insurers are vitally interested in fostering improved safety programs in the industrial area. In December last my colleague the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) announced that an office of road safety was to be established. The office will work in close association with the State and Territory road safety authorities and will play a major part in the national determination of priorities for the prevention of accident and injury. The major legislative power with regard to occupational safety in Australia lies with the States, so the Federal Government is limited in what it can do in that regard. Nevertheless, in its own sphere the Commonwealth has demonstrated that it is aware of the need for action by introducing a code of general principles for occupational safety and health in Australian Government employment. It is hoped that legislation broadly along the lines of the code will be introduced into the Territories. The House may be assured that the Governments interest in safety will be carried into any program for national compensation. In other words, the Government could develop jointly with the States the framework of a CommonwealthStates national compensation program; not a centralised program but a cooperative program utilising the expertise and administrative machinery that exists within the State governments and the private insurance industry. To this end the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) met with Ministers of State governments on 10 May last year for exploratory discussions on whether the States wished to cooperate with the Commonwealth in the joint development of a national compensation plan or whether they would prefer to develop plans separately on a State by State basis. The States reiterated their objections to the Woodhouse scheme but agreed to become involved in joint discussions. The meeting established a CommonwealthState officers steering committee to undertake a joint examination, including an assessment of the cost of various options for improving the present systems and expanding their coverage. The committee met for the first time on 23 and 24 June 1976, and it was resolved that the Department of Social Security should prepare working papers for consideration by State officials, which led to the preparation of a comprehensive document. This document sets out what needs to be done by Commonwealth and State governments to achieve the concepts of a national compensation scheme. Working papers which considered in detail aspects of coverage and benefits were circulated to the steering committee members in September last year. The steering committee meeting which was to have been held from 30 September to 1 October last year was deferred pending the conclusion of interdepartmental consultations. At the same time as consultations were being held with the States, discussions took place with the private insurance industry, employer organisations, trade unions, the medical and legal professions, welfare organisations and motorists organisations.

Therefore, it would not wish to take a vote on the Bill but would prefer to defer that vote at this stage.","Second Reading","NATIONAL REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[11]","N/A","N/A"
180,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BOWEN, Lionel","ZE4","Kingsford Smith","ALP","Smith",433,"Just briefly in the5 minutes remaining for this debate today I think it is worth while pointing out that although notice was given 12 months ago that this Bill would be introduced the best this Parliament can do for debate on the Bill is to provide this very limited period of time. This should clearly demonstrate the sort of priorities we give in this Parliament to matters of such major importance as this National Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill. The Opposition is fully appreciative of the reply given by the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt).  We welcome the fact that at least some continuing work is being done in this field. The Government seems to overlook the fact that an enormous amount of work was done by the 2 gentlemen who prepared the report His Honour Mr Justice Woodhouse and His Honour Mr Justice Meares, two very distinguished judicial identities. Mr Justice Woodhouse was closely associated with the compensation scheme in New Zealand. That scheme is working quite effectively and well. His Honour Mr Justice Meares is a most experienced advocate and is very dedicated to the concept of rehabilitation. He has a lot of knowledge in this area. Although they were able to take evidence from all over Australia and produce a report which we presented to the Parliament it got waylaidin a Senate committee which basically said that it supported it but it could see some problems in certain fringe areas. The sad fact is that in a parliament of this nature we cannot even produce compensation legislation covering members of parliament. If a member of parliament is injured he has to rely on some ex gratia payment. So it follows does it not, in view of that position, that we would have very little worry about the problems of other people. The tragedy of the situation is and this is well known to lawyers that it has become a lottery of chance as to whether a person gets compensation. If a person is injured while driving his car to or from work on a Monday he is covered. But if he is injured on the weekend he is not covered. An enormous number of people are excluded from workers compensation schemes. These people include casual workers, people employed in the fishing industry and domestic servants. An enormous number of people with dreadful disabilities are not covered for compensation. Of course the Government picks up the tab through the Department of Social Security. It is always interesting when honourable members talk about joint CommonwealthState consultations. I wonder whether any work will be done in relation to the number of people who having been compensated under these outmoded and cumbersome schemes that operate in the States have expended their money and are now a burden on the Social Security payroll. Because these people who suffered permanent disabilities were unable to live on the money which was awarded to them they are now on the Social Security payroll. They are being subsidised by the taxpayers. The Opposition welcomes the fact that the Government feels that it ought to have further consultations. But honourable members can see the malaise that seeps through this concept in the sense that while there was an initial meeting perhaps in May of last year we really have not seen very much progress yet. We will not see it while there is this interminable argument about an injured persons legal rights in the States and whether the Commonwealth is intruding. Is it not about time that we had a look at Australia as Australians? Does it matter what a persons legal rights are? If in fact a person isseriously injured and cannot carry on in his work why should he not be entitled to compensation Under a national scheme of compensation? The farmer on the land who is selfemployed gets nothing if he is injured in a tractor accident. It is an indictment on anybody who says he represents the rural interests that nothing has been done in this area. A young child who is injured gets very little compensation. It is cheaper in our society to kill a person than it is to maim a person. This is the sort of legalism we have at the present time. The WoodhouseMeares concept did away with that. It did away with a fault concept. If we could do away with just arguing about who is to blame we would save $20m in New South Wales. How silly it is. If honourable members look at the statistics they will see that not one State compensation fund is viable or can expect to be viable. It is confidently anticipated that State governments will have to bear the whole of the responsibility in motor vehicle insurance and workers compensation insurance because no private sector of the community can afford to take the risks that will be involved. Consider the enormous losses last year in New South Wales in the field of third party motor vehicle insurance. Over and above the premiums the loss was $49m. Admittedly this was reduced to $8m because of investment procedures but that merely meant that payment of compensation to those people who were injured was delayed for some time. Somebody had to sustain them in the meantime. Look at the tragic circumstance outlined in the Canberra Times today concerning a 19yearold man who is now a quadraplegic. He got an enormous sum of money, but if he dies that money will go to somebody else perhaps a member of his family. The concept is not right. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order!The time allotted for precedence to General Business has expired. The honourable member for KingsfordSmith will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day under General Business for the next sitting day.","Second Reading","NATIONAL REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

184,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KATTER, Bob","1V5","Kennedy","N/A","N/A",434,"This matter is indeed of public importance not just for the cattle producer, not just for the thousands of small businessmen the stockmen and all the other little people throughout the nation who, ever since Australia as such existed, have been a part of this rugged scenario, the truly Australian world of the cattle industry, not just the exporters, and not just the stock and station agents. No indeed. This Government and this nation cannot disregard and will not disregard the disaster which is closing in on an industry worth one billion dollars to this nation.  The Australian Labor Party stimulated by the philosophy of the Coombs report, could not at any stage disguise its venom towards country people or, more specifically, towards non metropolitan residents, hence the utter neglect of industries such as the beef industry. Let us look for a moment at just what has been done in the short time our Government has been in office. There is provision in the Budget for a further $ 15m to be made available as carryon loan assistance to be jointly financed with the States after joint CommonwealthState consideration. The conditions on the granting of these loans were liberalised to enable producers who had already obtained finance to apply once again. Earlyin 1976 the meat export inspection service provided by the Department of Agriculture was suspended. This is estimated to have saved the industry about $25m for the year 197677. There was a contribution to the beef industry of $ 18.5m. I admit that $1 lm approximately is the net amount involved because of the $1 per head cattle slaughter levy for the tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication campaign. There was a grant to the Australian Meat Board of $ 1.2m to cover the cost of the export charges on the sale of meat to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1975. Finally, speaking in a general sense, it might be confidently anticipated that the recent devaluation will permit exporters to take advantage of many more inquiries from nontraditional markets. Regrettably these measures gave little, if any, benefit to the desperate financial plight of the cattle producer. There must be an end to the recurring cycles of booms and recessions and the only machinery to achieve this is Government legislation. To me the industry is crying out, not for Government dollars, but for the reconstruction of the industry based on a cornerstone policy of stabilisation. The argument that supply and demand will determine a price structure and will stabilise market conditions for the producer is no longer acceptable to the cattlemen. It is interesting to note that since 1974 the demand for beef has increased by 50 per cent while prices have fallen lamentably and over the last few weeks, at least in Queensland, prices have dropped to such an extent that my colleague the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr McVeigh) purchased just the other day a 433lb vealer carcass hot for $20. It is calculated that this would be about onethird of the production costs of that beast. The cold facts are that the cattle producer does not have direct access to a true market and the price he receives bears little or no relationship to the price his product brings on an overseas market. So much for the supply and demand argument. It cannot be effective in a market place where, say, 25 000 producers are subject to the prices paid by half a dozen buyers. Every cattle producer in Australia is affected by these circumstances but I would point out that the State perhaps most affected by the collapse of the beef industry is Queensland. I do not think any other State has more individual cattle producers who are unable to diversify, so it is not surprising that some rather dramatic and certainly determined initiatives have emerged in that State. The State Government formed a beef industry committee which has submitted a proposed beef stabilisation plan which, it has been suggested, should have an initial trial period of 5 years with provision for extension at 5year intervals. Without going into the details of this scheme I think it would be an advantage to explain one or two features which I think are interesting. For instance, the plan refers to a livable price concept and this is explained as intending that the minimum price fixed should provide a return sufficient to enable the generally efficient grazier to survive in the industry until market prices improve. The committee claimed that a price of around 66c to 70c per kilogram, dressed weight basis, for first and second quality would be about the level required. I do not want to go into further details regarding this or any other stabilisation plan. I have only 15 minutes to deal with a subject that is of momentous importance and the major objective of this debate is to argue the general concept of stabilisation and to plead the cause for the utmost urgency in the matter of reconstructing the cattle producing industry. It is apparent that no marketing plan can be put into action until 2 matters are finalised. First, a uniform national classification scheme must be introduced. It is encouraging to note that the Agricultural Council, at its meeting at Launceston earlier this month, announced that Australias carcass classification scheme will be based on measurements of weight, fat depth and age of carcasses and will apply to cattle, sheep and pigs. Much more important was the announcement that chains would be operating in all States by June 1977. The industry is understandably urging the Government to pull out all stops and give this matter full priority, and I am confident that this is what is being done. The second matter essential to any plan is the organisation that will administer it, hence the insistence that the personnel of the newly organised Meat and Livestock Corporation be announced without delay. Let me say with complete conviction that throughout the land the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) is being urged to bring the Corporation under producer control. I believe that no Minister for Primary Industry in history has ever had such difficulties to contend with. He has received hundreds of representations in relation to the new Corporation and, in accordance with the way in which this Government acts, each of these has been respected and evaluated. However, I must say to the Minister, if I am to project truthfully the unanimity of opinion I have received from the producers, that if the composition of the Corporation was announced before lunchtime today, it would not be too soon. One matter to which I must refer is the necessity for the subcommittee of the Agricultural Council to have its recommendations examined and processed with all urgency so that this will not be an inhibiting factor to delay the Governments attention to the marketing requirements of the producer. There was much disappointment, if not considerable anger, when it was learnt that the matter of stabilisation was not effectively discussed at the Launceston meeting. I regret that I have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter with Queenslands Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Vic Sullivan, to learn why the required recommendations were not ready for the Launceston meeting. I must return again to the main theme of this debate, that is, to stress again what can only be described as victimisation of the cattle producer by a system which coldly denies him a fair share of export returns. I think at this stage that I would do well to quote some comments made by the leader of the National Country Party, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in the House only last week. He gave figures which indicated record meat sales during 1977 due, I might mention, to the tremendous activity by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Minister for Primary Industry and, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister himself.

Their threat, which most certainly will materialise into action, is that they will go it alone. They will kill, process and export in their own right. Could they be blamed for this if one read, as I did the day before yesterday, in a New Zealand newspaper dated 9 February 1977 a report of sales which had been held the previous day?

They have now found that markets are not available for it. What we are facing now is a massive social crisis in some sections of the beef industry. There is a need for firm reconstruction policy, a lead which the Party of the honourable member for Kennedy is incapable of giving.  Let us get down to the real issues. The present Government has been in office since December 1973. It has had all that time to do something firm about the plight of the Australian beef industry. It has removed the meat inspection levy and handed the benefit squarely to meat exporters and not to producers. We told the Government that that would happen, yet it still gave it to the exporters because the real friends of this Government are not the beef producers but the meat companies who are friendly with the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), who is on the board of one such company, and the Minister for Primary Industry. The Government was happy to give them a little more to go into their pockets. If honourable members do not believe me they should refer to the statistics made available to this House by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) relating to the profits of the meat exporting companies this year. Those profits have skyrocketed in the past 12 months because of the Governments policy. But where is the producer? The producer is left destitute because all that the Government has done since it came to office has been to creep in here with an amendment to a Labor Party piece of legislation by which it will provide $ 1 5m in carry on loans to the beef industry, whereas the Labor Party when in government provided $47.5m to that industry. We have had enough of the Governments humbug, its duplicity and its deceit. It has let the beef producers down. It has consistently let agriculture down. We will not tolerate or let the Government get away with this snide attempt to exonerate the Minister for Primary Industry from his task. Every rural newspaper in this country is critical of the behaviour of the Minister for Primary Industry. They say he is lax in his job; that he is incompetent; that he cannot be trusted overseas; that he sells industry down the drain. They are correct. The point is that if the Government wants to be credible on agriculture it needs to develop some sensible marketing policy, some stabilisation policies and some readjustment policies. All the Government has done in all the years it has been in government is to foster more production, thereby creating oversupply. Ultimately we have seen industries and families go destitute. So enough of the Governments humbug. We on this side of the House support the Australian beef industry and are sympathetic to its plight. But we will not watch Government supporters come in here and try to exonerate an incompetent Minister for his incompetence and his lack of sympathy for an industry which is in dire economic circumstances.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","AUSTRALIAN BEEF INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[16]","N/A","N/A"
225,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CARIGE, Colin","JW8","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",439,"I listened to the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) with some interest. In fact, I should like to congratulate him on misrepresenting nearly everybody in the House, including members of the Labor Party. The Labor Party brought about the ruinous situation that faces our beef producers today. The honourable member for Blaxland did not even have the decency to read what the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) said when he outlined the assistance we have provided to the rural sector. He even stated incorrectly that we had been in government for 2 years. He went on to read probably the best speech I have ever heard him read from the Australian Financial Review.  There are some vital aspects of Australias present beef dilemma that I am obliged to canvass in this House today as the representative for Capricornia, one of the vital beef producing regions of Australia. Among these points are the following key elements: Retention of cattle on properties; the need for unity throughout the industry; the Japanese cattle and beef enterprises operating in Australia. These establish the fact that there are 2 industries the beef industry and the cattle industry. I shall deal firstly with cattle retention. Most Australians are aware that our once great beef industry has been down on its knees for 3 long years, that it has been kicked to death by cunning exporters and even domestic buyers in practices bordering on collusive buying, motivated by greed. They have bled the ordinary cattlemen dry. For instance, in Queensland in one small valley I know just south of Rockhampton some 15 000 head of cattle bought by a big meat company at give away prices are on agistment. This story is repeated over and over in Queensland and New South Wales. There are herds involving tens of thousands of head of cattle. All of them owned by exporting companies. All these are being held to try to manipulate the beef market in Australia. Immediately there is the faintest sign of a market revival for example, a major upturn in the United States market which is expected about the middle of this calendar year the exporters and big companies will begin killing off these cattle in a determined attempt to flatten any national beef revival. It is cruel, it is tragic, but it is a fact of life. As a member representing an important beef area, I have just one message to give to the Australian cattle producer. Beat the big companies at their own game. If it is at all possible, suffer the financial hardship a little longer. Now that rains have come good rains over most of Australiaregulate the supply of your cattle on to the market. Do not flood the market every time there is a slight upturn. Force the hand of these big manipulators. Drive them out of their bargain basement stock and then sit back and watch the market recover. The second point I wish to force home today is the urgency for all sections of the beef producing industry to get together and to talk with unity and common sense. The industry cannot expect government and government ministers to help positively with its problems if there is disunity and squabbling amongst its producer groups. The industry should force its producer representatives to stop their petty politicking and their attempts at personal headline grabbing. It should force them to get together as a group of men representing them, the beef producers. They should tell them the decisions they wantdecisions like firm marketing policies. They should tell them they have had enough. They should adopt a stronger voice in the overall national beef scene. Greater accuracy and a lot more information on marketing intelligence and so on is required. When the industry starts to do these things it will see its industry prosper, but certainly not before. Make no mistake, the old system has failed and a new form of marketing must be implemented. My third key point relates to Japanese beef enterprises in Australia. I think all honourable members would know that I am not against overseas companies establishing worthwhile industries in this country. Far from it, in fact. I am against overseas interests getting too much of the Australian farm. In 20 years time we do not want to be a distant colonial outpost of a political or a powerful Japanese interest. Let me explain that a little more. When Australia sells beef to Japan, the Japanese interpose a Japanese buying agency, namely the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation, which buys at ruling Australian market prices and marks up everything from 400 per cent to 500 per cent and in some cases even higher. Most of this money goes to subsidise inefficient Japanese beef producers. We can call them inefficient because of the area of land they hold and the small number of cattle they can run on the small areas. This is legitimate and if that is the way they want to play the game it is up to them. It is important to consider the magnitude of the levels the Japanese imposed. In 197576 the LIPC levy was about $52m. This is equal to 10 per cent of our export earnings from beef and veal for 197576. In fact it amounts to $5.11 per head of all cattle and calves slaughtered in Australia during 197576. The levy was equal to 1.32 cents per pound carcase weight for the total beef and veal produced in Australia during 197576. Also in that year the LIPC levy plus the import tax was about $72m. This is equal to 14.5 per cent of our total export earnings from beef and veal, or $7.01 per head of all cattle slaughtered or $1.83 per pound for the total production of beef and veal in Australia. These levies are specifically directed at protecting the Japanese beef producers and are not used as a source of revenue for the Japanese Government. We also have Japanese operators coming into this country and establishing feed lots. They buy the beast and sell it direct to the Japanese agency. So Japan gets 400 to 500 per cent profit at the agency as well as fattening profits in Australia. But now the Japanese are demanding and getting more. They are becoming even greedier. They have bought and are continuing to buy large tracts of Australian land this time to breed the beast. They hold this land now in New South Wales and Queensland and they are buying more there and elsewhere. Not happy with the profits in Japan and not happy with the Australian fattening profits, the Japanese now want to take the bread from the mouth of the Australian beef producers and breed the animal as well. None of these profits incidentally comes to Australia. Right from the ground up the Japanese now want the lot. At a time of depression and great hardship in the Australian beef industry I say that is simply not good enough. The fourth point I make is that we have 2 industries, one beef and one cattle. At present we can forecast with a reasonable degree of accuracy that exports will be at an almost record level and beef market price will surely move up because of the decline in cattle slaughter numbers in the majority of overseas countries especially those with which we now trade. We cannot say the same about cattle prices. We have 2 commodities completely unrelated price wise. I seek permission to have incorporated in Hansard a graph showing saleyard prices of cattle from 1966 to 1977.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","AUSTRALIAN BEEF INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We would not be completely in agreement about why it is in a mess, of course, but I am sure we are all in agreement on many of the underlying problems of the beef industry. The beef industry is in a mess because of inherent difficulties. It has long term problems, problems connected with economic self sufficiency in other countries such as Japan which protect their farming communities, the same as we do here, and subsidise them. The beef industry is also in a terrible mess because it has two great liabilities. I refer of course to the two great political liabilities that the beef industry has in this Parliament. I mention firstly the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who went to a dinner in America and was invited to talk about the beef industry. He did not initiate the discussion. Leaders opposite talk about the quantity of exports involved but do not know the figures. My colleague the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) pointed this fact out very well. This is gross incompetency on behalf of the leaders of this country who pretend to have the beef industry at heart but really are not well briefed on it. They are more concerned with other matters of direct interest to them and perform very badly in looking after the interests of the beef industry whenever they go overseas.  The other big liability is the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). I think the great liability at the moment is the Ministers procrastination over a wide range of measures which could help the beef industry and which have been requested by a large number of organisations within the industry. A whole range of matters is involved but probably the matter which warrants the most urgent consideration is the failure to establish the Australian meat and livestock corporation. This proposal has been under consideration for some time. We get all sorts of excuses and delays, but nothing happens. At this time a whole range of rural publications and comments in the rural media is criticising the Minister. Members or organisations such as Federal and State livestock producers organisations, the Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian National Cattlemens Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Farmers Federation are all calling for a change in the structure of the Australian Meat Board. What has the Minister done? He has done nothing. The Minister has not taken any action regarding the promise to which he gave great prominence in the policy speech. I refer to the establishment of a national rural bank. All sorts of problems are associated with the establishment of a national rural bank. When it is established it will probably be seen to be in the form of some sort of window dressing without any real substance. He made the promise; he has not produced the goods, in the same way as he made the promise about restructuring the Australian Meat Corporation. He thought that devaluation would get him off the hook in relation to the beef industry. It may have, for a few weeks. Now the chickens have come home to roost. It is quite apparent that he has not been got off the hook. The huge differences between the returns and the cost of producing beef have not been offset by devaluation. Prices are still low. Producers continue to be exploited by meat processors. Devaluation has been merely a temporary expedient. It has done nothing to solve the long term problems of the industry. I quote from an article by Mr Cameron, the Executive Officer of the Australian National Cattlemens Council:","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","AUSTRALIAN BEEF INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

237,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FRY, Ken","JXQ","Fraser","N/A","N/A",441,"That is a measure of the desperate straits which the beef industry is in. Last year when I spoke on this matter I tabled a document showing the excessive profits which all meat exporters were making. I understand that this trend is continuing. I substantiated my charges by showing the profits made by F. J. Walker Ltd, Tancred Bros Pty Ltd of which the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) is a director; and the meat producers in Macarthur will be aware of his division of interests between Tancred Bros and the producersMetropolitan Meat Co. Pty Ltd, J. C. Hutton Pty Ltd and T. A. Fields Pty Ltd. The figures are here. They have been well circulated. They have been reinforced by a letter which I received a few days ago from a producer at Hughenden, Queensland. This lady, who is an official of the local branch of the Cattlemens Union of Australia, paints a very nice picture of the way in which the local meatworks, which produces a lot of meat, is manipulating the market in Townsville: the practice of meatworks owning properties running thousands of head of cattle and their practice of using the fat and boner stock from these properties to flood the market at a time when most forest country cattle are coming into the auction yard could be transgressing some part of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.  It is good when one section of the industry practises restrictive trade agreements which manipulate the market to the disadvantage of the producer. She also wrote about a Townsville works, which I understand is mainly owned by F. J. Walker: .. one Townsville works contemplates killing 2000 head per week from its properties for 2 months this season and will not be buying outside cattle. It is a wonderful situation in one of the largest cattle growing areas in Australia. The lady further wrote: . . in most areas cattle can only be turned off in reasonable condition while the grass is still growing and hasnt gone to seed. Pan of this time, the early Wet, boggy conditions make it impossible either to muster or to transport cattle to the works. Hence on the more remote properties cattle are mustered after the Wet end March and reach the market in late April to early July, which is when the exporting companies have decided to move their own cattle. Naturally prices are depressed. This is a blatant case of a meatworks manipulating the market to its own advantage and to the disadvantage of the producer. I have no doubt that this situation is being duplicated in many meatworks throughout the country. If one looks at who owns the meatworks and the fingers that they have in the pie at the producing end, the number of cattle they own and the number of acres they control, one sees that they are in a very strong position to manipulate the market to the disadvantage of the producer. This lady to whom I referred also wrote about the big cattle property Stanbroke, which is owned by Thomas Borthwick and Sons Ltd, the Australian Mutual Provident Society and Sir Sidney Kidman. These are the big properties which manipulate the market. What chance has a small producer? All the information we have about the industry is that it is in a mess. On the other side, we have the very sorry picture of the Government doing nothing about it. The Minister for Primary Industry has let the industry down badly because he has a conflict of interest. Despite the fact that he represents a country seat, his background is very much Establishment and part of the commercial world. He certainly has a conflict of interest in trying to look after the interests of the producer and at the same time wanting to protect the interests of the meat processors who continue to make high profits at the expense of the producers. It is quite obvious that these people have been badly let down. I think the future of the meat industry is in many ways tied up with the future of the Minister for Primary Industry. He is in a dilemma. He has pressure from both sides. He does not know which way to jump.

We find that this is impossible. It was probably an optimistic estimate when the Committee was appointed because we had to cover an immense amount of territory to see people. The prorogation for a week has prevented us from carrying out an important part of our program. As I remarked this morning, I think we should have a close look at the prorogation procedures and determine whether what we are doing next weekthat is, suspending the life of the Parliament, almost, for many important things is necessary, bearing in mind the meaning of prorogation. I ask that the Parliament, as soon as it reconvenes, reconstitute the Committee and extend its date for reporting to 18 August 1977. The Parliament is well served by members of that Committee. They give a lot of time in faraway places. Although there is a very wide divergence of political opinion amongst its members, I am quite certain that the report which will be finally produced will be the consensus of keen minded, hard working people who will have surrendered prejudices from both sides to do something for the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.","N/A","JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE ON ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The number of people enrolled in the different divisions represented in this House is unconscionably uneven. Last night the Opposition showed that it was willing and anxious to make a distribution possible. We have, of course, sought a redistribution for years in Opposition, in Government and again in Opposition.  I want to dispose immediately of the notion that a distribution had to await the 3 Bills that were introduced last night. The High Court in 2 cases McKinlays case at the end of 1975 and McKellars case this month has made it plain that there were some objectionable features in the Representation Act. But it also made it clear that a distribution could proceed on the basis of the provisions in the Constitution. The provisions of the Representation Act exceeded the limits permitted by the Constitution. They were therefore null and void. One of the pieces of exquisite irony is that in McKellars case this month the Chief Justice joined in declaring unconstitutional the amendments which, as AttorneyGeneral, he had endorsed when they were put forward by an earlier Coalition Government in February 1964. In fact the Chief Justice and the associate justices in McKellars case this month unanimously endorsed the view of the Representation Act 1964 which Mr Justice Murphy had volunteered in McKinlays case at the end of 1975. The Constitution can apply, and the court made it plain that by executive act a distribution could take place, without any of the amendments which were proposed by the 3 Bills introduced last night and passed by the Senate earlier that evening.

I do not draw attention to the Tasmanian figures because, as honourable members will appreciate, under the Constitution Tasmania, being an original State, is entitled to a minimum number of 5 divisions even if its population would not entitle it to that number. Accordingly, Tasmania is the most evenly distributed of all the States. Western Australia is more evenly distributed than the States other than Tasmania, because it was distributed in 1974 when my Government proposed that it should have the number of divisions to which the 1971 census had shown it was entitled. Whilst we expedited the 2 Bills to amend the Representation Act and the Census and Statistics Act, we oppose this Bill to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The amendments being made by this Bill are designed to distort and frustrate the amendments which were made to the principal Act at a Joint Sitting of the Parliament in July 1974 after the double dissolution of April 1974. This was one of the Bills which was the occasion for the double dissolution. This and the Medibank legislation were put through at the Joint Sitting. The amendments which are being made now are essentially twofold.

The proposition I put, the proposition that the people accepted at the election in May 1974 and the proposition that the Parliament accepted in July 1974, was that all electors should be much more equal than they had previously been regarded and, in particular, that the permissible divergence from the quota, from the average enrolment for the divisions in any State, should not exceed 10 per cent above or below the quota. That was in substitution for the earlier provision that the divergence should not be more than 20 per cent above or below the quota. As everybody knows, during the last election campaign no member of the Liberal or National Country Parties proposed that there should be any reversion to the 20 per cent divergence. Everybody silently accepted the 10 per cent.  That was not a novel proposition. It was a proposition which had been recommended to the Parliament in 1958 and again in 1959 by the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review composed, as I pointed out on the referendum Bills last week, of equal numbers of members from the then government, the Liberal and Country Parties, and the then Opposition, the Labor Party. There were 6 members of the Labor Party, 4 members of the Liberal Party and 2 members of the Country Party. There were 8 members of this House and 4 senators. They all agreed, including the experienced members of the Country Party, Mr Drummond and Mr Hamilton, nearly 20 years ago that the proper thing and certainly the feasible thing was to have a distribution of our electorates so that there should never be a divergence of more than 10 per cent above or below the quota in any State. A requirement is now being inserted in the guidelines for distributing the divisions in any State to ensure that the smallest enrolment in any small electorate will be larger than the largest enrolment in any large electorate. The minimum enrolment for a small electorate will be the maximum enrolment for any large electorate in the same State.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At any rate, it was not Labor legislation. The requirement that the Commissioners should give due consideration to the trend of population changes within the State was introduced by a LiberalCountry Party Government. It was supported on that aspect by me when I was in opposition and by my colleagues. So it is something we are all agreed on. It means quite reasonably, one would think, that the Distribution Commissioners should try to see that the enrolment in any division which is bound to grow in its enrolment is as far below the quota at the time the distribution is made as the enrolment in that division would be expected to be above that quota at the time the next distribution would be made.  In Australia, as we know, the big population changes occur in the State capitals and sometimes in a few other coastal cities. Whether that is a healthy sign or not is a matter of debate. I tried to do something about that form of distribution of population by promoting AlburyWodonga to see whether it was possible to have another large inland city in Australia. Nevertheless, the fact is that the increases in population and the increases in enrolment take place in the State capitals above all. They take place in what under this Bill are categorised as small divisions. But the catch is this: If in any of the States the Commissioners set a small enrolment in a small division in the expectation that the enrolment in that division will grow before the next distribution takes place, they are automatically setting a ceiling on the enrolment in any large division. We know that generally the large divisions as denned in this Bill, that is the ones with an area of 5000 square kilometres or more, are the ones which grow most slowly. That is the case in enrolment and that is the case in population as well. It is among the small divisions that the enrolment grows most rapidly and also the population grows more rapidly. It will be noted that I draw a distinction between enrolment and population because the enrolment does not take into account Aboriginals, who do not have to enrol, and it does not of course take into account aliens, who cannot enrol. It is not easy to get the figure for Aboriginals because those figures are collected only at the census, and until the 1967 referendum was carried Aboriginals could not be counted in the census. It is a fact that Kalgoorlie, the largest electorate in Australia and perhaps in the world, does in fact have the largest population in Western Australia. It has perhaps the smallest enrolment but it has the largest population because it has most of the Aboriginals in that State and they do not have to enrol. Similarly, Kennedy and Leichhardt have larger populations than one would think because they are the other divisions in the States where there are an exceptional number of Aboriginals. An interjector referred to the case of some of the city seats, and there one finds an exceptional number of aliens. One can get an idea of the number of aliens in a division before receiving the census results by looking at the number of people who are naturalised in it. Here I draw attention to an answer I was given on 28 May last by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MacKellar) giving the number of certificates of citizenship granted in excess of 100 in the various local government areas in Australia. I will give those in New South Wales which had the largest number of certificates granted in 1975: Botany local government area 1200; Canterbury, 3183; Marrickville, 3390, and incidentally, that is in the electorate of Grayndler to which the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) drew attention; Randwick, 1291; Rockdale, 1110; Warringah, 1203; Wollongong, 1409. In Victoria there were no areas where as many as 1000 certificates were granted, but those which had 700 or more were Brunswick 702, Springvale 760, and Sunshine 761. Those over 600 were Broadmeadows 611, Footscray 667, Moorabbin 636, Northcote 667, Oakleigh 661, Prahran 609 and Preston 639. It will be seen that the greatest number of aliens, as shown by the number of people receiving certificates of naturalisation, is in what are called small divisions. They are in the capitals or in Newcastle and Wollongong and the cluster of local government areas around Geelong. So it is true that one must distinguish between population and enrolment in looking at electoral loads. I can certify that migrants, individually or as families create very much more electoral work than people who were born in this country. It may be that a conscientious member would find that Aborigines as individuals or families also present a greater work load than Australians of European ancestry or birth. In electoral justice, one has to discard all such considerations of population movement, Aborigines and aliens. One must take notice solely of the enrolment. If the commissioners yield to the temptation to make allowance for anticipated population changes in electorates in Australia they will inevitably have an underenrolment, an enrolment beneath the present quota, in a great number of small electorates. They will then be setting a ceiling on every large division of that State. That would not be an unacceptable situation.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has been possible in the United States, and the distribution proposed in the last Parliament showed that it was possible also in Australia, to have a distribution which had an almost identical number of people enrolled in every division. That is, every citizen was regarded as equal. That is the only way by which we can have a decent distribution under the Act as it stands or under this Bill if it is carried. But this attempt to divide divisions into large and small is designed to distort and frustrate the large measure of equality which was determined at the joint sitting in July 1974 at the behest of the people at the double dissolution election in May 1974.  The other provision to which the Opposition objects is that which says that if there is a distribution then normally there should not be another distribution for 7 years. Under Federal electoral provisions there has been for many years I will stand correction on this but I believe it has always been the case a requirement that there could be a distribution whenever in onefourth of the divisions of the State the number of electors differs from the quota to a greater extent than onefifth, as it used to be, or onetenth, as it now is; or by onefifth less, as it used to be, or onetenth less, as it now is. That has always been the case. Where the variation in enrolment has exceeded the permissible margin in a quarter of the electorates in a State then, the Act states, there may be a distribution. The inference is that there should be a distribution. What will happen now, we have been told in this Bill, is that where there has been a distribution of a State in divisions then there will not be another redistribution of that State by virtue of a quarter or more of the electorates diverging beyond the quota within a period of 7 years after that distribution. That means that there is a discouragement from having another distribution within 7 years. It is true that in this Bill we can no longer saythe High Court has made it plain that we cannot say that there should be at the end of a full Parliament an election for a number of divisions which is not sanctioned by the provisions of the Constitution. That is, in the ordinary life of a Parliament there has to be a distribution of a State where the Constitution shows that that State is entitled to more or fewer divisions than it had at the time that Parliament was elected. That cannot be frustrated now. The High Court will not allow it. But otherwise, if the number of divisions in the State is still correct, it will not matter if this Bill is passed how distorted the divisions in that State become. The normal thing, the encouragement, the criterion, would be that there would be no distributions more often than every 7 years. The fact is that in the mainland States we have long had the situation where more than a quarter of the divisions exceed the permissible margin.

It will be noticed how much the divisions have got out of kilter in 7 years and that is what this Bill encourages.

In New South Wales there were ninethis is last September above the permissible margin and eleven below. In Victoria there were eight above and eleven below. In Queensland there were six above and six below. In South Australia there were three above and one below. Already in Western Australia, in the course of 2 years, there was one above and two below. It is quite obviously an unsatisfactory and undemocratic principle to encourage this freezing of a distribution for 7 years. Honourable members can see what has happened in the last 7 years. I realise the burden that can exist in having such divergences as there are.

If it is analysed I think honourable members will find that the answer is that this legislation literally cuts right across some of the desires and aims of the Leader of the Opposition. He went right back some 18 or 20 years by quoting some case put by members of the then Australian Country Party who were on the Constitutional Review Committee, namely the honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Canning, when he said that they agreed that no electorate should have a population 10 per cent in excess of or 10 per cent below any other electorate. Of course that is exactly what this legislation does, and this is why I could not understand what the Leader of the Opposition was talking about. The honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) who is sitting to my right behind me is seeking to interrupt but I do not know whether he knows very much about this either.

I was about to say when the honourable member for Burke drew attention to the state of the House I am grateful to him for doing so because there is now a large audience that the Leader of the Opposition made great play on the fact that the migrant population created a good deal more work than was required in respect of the normal voting population. I draw the attention of the honourable member to the statement by my colleague the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) who said not very long ago that in working for his constituents he spends the equivalent of 35 weeks of 35 hours behind the wheel of a motor car. I suppose it would be fair to say that the honourable member for Riverina would have a larger migrant population in his electorate than possibly the Leader of the Opposition or most of the members of the Opposition would have in their electorates.

That is a typical example of what could happen if the Opposition were given the opportunity to implement their desires on electoral matters. It is quite obvious to me that since the removal from this chamber of the former honourable member for Grayndler the Leader of the Opposition has been pretty well astray on these matters.  This Bill is introduced as a result of the High Court decision whereby the number of members in the House of Representatives will be tied to the number of Senate representatives in the 6 States as compared with the suggestion that the representatives for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory should be included. The High Court decision means that whilst we have 60 senators representing the 6 States then the House of Representatives shall have a minimum number of 120 members. Only if a State has in excess of 50 per cent over and above the States allocation shall it have one more seat. According the the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers), it is pretty obvious that the new Parliament, after the redistribution, will comprise 120 members from the 6 States with the possibility of one more from Queensland being included, making 121 members. I have spoken to the Leader of the Opposition about this matter and I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table presented in the Senate by the Minister for Administrative Services on 23 February and appearing on page 316 of the Senate record.

He spoke about the work load connected with migrants in his electorate but he paid little consideration to the work load of those people who have different problems. I pointed out the problems of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) and there are numerous others. Heaven only knows what are the problems with which the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) is associated. He is fortunate if he can visit all corners of his electorate once a year. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis), a member of the Labor Party, is in the same position. Members of the Labor Party have always worked on the principle that electoral boundaries should be based entirely, or almost entirely, on numbers of people. This, of course, means that it has concentrated its efforts predominantly on the workers in the metropolitan areas. It is always a wonder to me why it does not lift its sights a little because at this time, out of 120 members, 47 members represent what we call outer metropolitan areas. The strange thing is that only 2 of those electorates are represented by the Labor Party. Surely this proves the point that the Labor Party has concentrated its efforts in the wrong quarters and that it ought to do a little better than this.

I refer specifically to clause 7 which gives consideration to area which, of course, has always been disregarded by the Opposition. Under this new Bill for the first time there has been stipulated an area of 5000 square kilometres. Honourable members opposite may want to query why 5000 square kilometres has been mentioned but it is pretty obvious. There is a very marked degree of difference in these areas because the smallest electorate above 5000 square kilometres today is the electorate of Ballaarat with 5730 square kilometres. The largest electorate under 5000 square kilometres is that of La Trobe with 2606 square kilometres. So there is no argument about electorates being just inside or just outside that limit. It is a very clearcut issue and I compliment the AttorneyGeneral (Mr Ellicott) for selecting that particular area.  What this really means is that no electorate with an area of over 5000 square kilometres shall have more constituents than those which are under 5000 square kilometres. The Leader of the Opposition tried to imply that this was a loading in favour of country areas but he failed to remind the House that in the Bill there is another limit, that being 10 per cent below or 10 per cent above. Irrespective of what figures the redistribution commissioners come up with, they have to maintain that criterion of being within the limits of 10 per cent below and 10 per cent above. The other point I wish to make and I think I have made it in this Chamber before is that the Opposition, despite its criticism of these things and the numerical strength in country areas, has never been critical of the decision of the Constitutional Convention to alter the situation in Tasmania. As time goes by, of course, the population of Tasmania is growing. I am not being critical but I suppose it is a wonder that this is not an occasion when the Opposition wants to change this situation for the simple reason that it does not have one representative from the State of Tasmania. Perhaps we might hear from a member of the Opposition on this matter but if one principle is good enough for one area, it is good enough for another area. On 23 February the Minister for Administrative Services made available to the Senate a number of statistical tables which, I believe, answer many of the questions that are relevant to the very important matters contained in this Bill. I have spoken to the Leader of the Opposition about them and he has agreed that they could be incorporated in the House of Representatives Hansard.

I go along with that proposition because there are problems in the areas involved. Those problems are not confined to one particular political party because, as it so happens, all three parties are represented in those 7 electorates. They include the electorates of Kalgoorlie, Grey, Maranoa, Darling, Leichhardt and Kennedy. I believe that some consideration should have been given to those areas, because if the migrant population creates a heavy work load to people representing the metropolitan areas, we should think of the work load imposed, for example, on my colleagues, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett), in trying to visit their constituents. As I have said on a previous occasion, very few constituents in those areas can contact their Federal member at a local telephone call charge; they all have to pay the trunk call fee. If they wanted to visit their Federal member for any reason, heaven only knows what would be the average distance they would have to travel. In many cases it would be hundreds of miles instead of the few hundred yards which people in the metropolitan areas have to travel.  In the short time available to me I want to make a very brief comment about my own electorate because all of the speculators have forecast that my electorate is about to disappear. If that does occur, I suppose I will be very disappointed, but what is far more important than that is the fact that the Wimmera electorate has been in existence since Federation. Wimmera is not only the name of a Federal electorate, it is also a well known geographical name and no doubt the people who live in that constituency will be very disappointed, not at seeing my face disappear from the scene but rather at seeing the disappearance of the electorate in which they have been so proud to be resident for many years.

I have heard it on the grapevine that many honourable members opposite will be plugging for the disappearance of Wannon before they will be plugging for the disappearance of Wimmera. It surprises me to hear these political bushrangers who sit in the corner seats to the left of the Labor Party stand up and weep every time redistributions are mentioned. They have quite a history of that sort of thing. They are notorious for it. I refer to the National Country Party, the same Party which rules in Queensland with 29 per cent of the popular vote. That Party is quite expert at rigging boundaries to get itself into power. I do not go along with the proposition put by the honourable member for Wimmera, namely, that there is a need to make country electorates smaller in area so that the member can serve it better. I believe that members could better represent their constituents if those who represented large areas lived in those large areas. I know that some honourable members who represent country electorates in fact live in capital cities. I think that proposition ought to be put to rest. I point out that it is not my intention to slur every person who represents a large electorate. However, some honourable members are able to do that.  I have put the proposition before, and I will put it again, that the function of a member of Parliament in Australia is twofold. I mention them not necessarily in order of priority. One of his functions is to come into this chamber and cast a vote on a particular issue on behalf of the people who live in the electorate he represents. As I read the Constitution, that is my understanding of what it intends. The other function of a member of Parliament this is a practice which has grown up more than anything else is for him to endeavour personally to interview people in his electorate. Because of the time that we spend away from our electorates that, of course, is not possible. Therefore I do not believe we do the institution of Parliament very much good if we endeavour to prostitute the Constitution by making some electorates smaller in number than others. That would create a disadvantage for those in the smaller electorates compared with those in the larger electorates. When honourable members cast a vote in this place they ought to be representing as nearly as practicable, to use the words of the Constitution, the same number of people. The servicing of ones electorate, as I pointed out, is a different proposition altogether. If a member has a heavy work load he cannot do that adequately because he spends so much time away from his electorate. That is a job that can be done by staff and facilities provided for the member. I have said before, and I will say again I stand by this proposition at all timesthat if the people of Australia demand service from their parliamentarians they must face up to the fact that they have to provide their parliamentarians with the tools with which to carry out their trade.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Country Party supporters always raise the matter of only 5 members of the Parliament coming from Tasmania. It was not Labor Premiers who sat around the table and drafted that document called the Constitution; it was conservative Premiers. It is not so very many years ago that Tasmania was not the only State that had only 5 representatives in this place. It did not have the population to enable it to have greater representation. I well remember when South Australia and Western Australia were in that position. However, the population in those 2 States has grown and they nave advanced from that situation. It was anticipated by those who drafted the Constitution that that would happen for a variety of reasons. I do not wish to cast any slurs on the people who live on that beautiful island south of Australia. It just has not developed to the stage at which its population warrants even the 5 representatives that it has. After the next election it will have five even better representatives. I think it is almost an impossibility for the population of the island State to develop to the stage where it will have more than 5 representatives.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has served no useful purpose in the years that it has been there. Rather than increase its size, I think it should be diminished. Certainly its powers ought to be greatly curtailed.  The clauses in the Bill to which the Opposition raises objection have been very eloquently dealt with by the Leader of the Oppositionthe Leader of the Labor Party the honourable Gough Whitlam. Clause 7 of the Bill is a matter of great concern to us in the Labor Party because it is another attempt by the National Country Party to get its own way. It could not get its way by having the Electoral Act changed to return the variation to 20 per cent above and below the quota. Honourable members will recall that that was changed during the Joint Sitting. The Act was then amended to provide for a variation of only 10 per cent. The National Country Party could not get its way. It then came up with the proposition that no electorate in the country should be larger in size than the smallest division in a city. On the face of it, that sounds very plausible. But I can use as an example my electorate, which has a high built in growth factor. This lines up with clause 10 of the Bill also. In 1968 when this division of Burke was created it had a voting population of 48 000 electors. Now, in 1977, which is almost 9 years later, it has very nearly 100 000 electors. In other words, it has doubled in size in almost 9 years. Clause 10 of the Bill almost prohibits a redistribution other than every 7 years. Taking as an example the electoral division of Mallee, which has over 50 000 electors, as my electoral division virtually had in 1968, that division now has 52 000 or 54 000 electors, whereas I now have 100 000 electors. This is the way in which divisions within a State can become completely out of balance, not through action by anybody but because the outer areas of Sydney and Melbourne indeed, of all the capital citiesare the only places to which the increasing population can go to live. For various reasons these people do not want to go to live in the country areas and even those who live in the country areas go into the city to live. Therefore, the proposition put in clause 7 would perpetrate that sort of inequality. In 1968 the Distribution Commissioners were able to consider the division of Burke. It was known that the population within that division was going to increase rather dramatically so they were able to place it some thousands of voters below the quota, knowing that even by the time of the next election, which was some year and a half later, the division would very nearly be back to the quota. In fact, they were right. But they would not be able to do that under this legislation. They would have to place the federal division of Burke, or any other division that had a high inbuilt growth factor, on the quota. Otherwise, if they were able to bring down the size of the rapidly growing divisions to a particular figure, it would immediately set the size for every country division in the district. These divisions would then very soon, because of the growth factor effect, have numbers so far below those in the metropolitan areas that the whole thing would immediately become lopsided and distorted. I have always regarded it as being immoral for politicians to determine electoral boundaries and for them to talk about electoral matters. I think it is fair enough that they should express views on the matter because they are professionals in the field, but I think the decisionmaking process should not be theirs alone. I would support very strongly any move to utilise part of the High Court as an electoral commission to have exclusive responsibility for the setting of boundaries and for the determining, in line with our Constitution, such matters as are covered in the very clause which we are debating now, that is, clause 7, relating to the above and below quota variation. I do not think the determination of these issues should be the prerogative of parliamentarians. I think the community looks at the present situation with a jaundiced eye. The present situation certainly is open to misuse, as has happened over the years in various States. The latest example occurred again in Queensland. South Australia had the LiberalCountry League Sir Thomas Playford s Governmentruling for something like 30 years with a minority of votes. That sort of situation exists in Victoria. It is impossible for the Labor Party to go ahead because the boundaries are drawn up by a parliament in which the Labor Party does not have a majority. That situation is immoral. It is a wonder that it has been tolerated for so long. My suggestion about the removal of responsibility for the setting of boundaries from politicians is not unique. It happens now in South Australia. Appeals against divisions in South Australia are not determined by the South Australian Parliament; they are determined by the Supreme Court of South Australia. The Labor Government presented to the Parliament a redistribution proposal which was prepared by fair and reasonable people I know that immediately excludes members of the National Country Party who considered it to be a fair and reasonable redistribution. For about the first time it involved the principle of one vote one value, so that each of the voting citizens of our country, as nearly as was humanly possible, were fairly and equitably represented in the Parliament. It disadvantaged one of the major political parties the National Country Party. I really do not think it disadvantaged the Liberal Party. Certainly, it did not advantage or disadvantage the Labor Party. Had the National Country Party been disadvantaged by it, it would not have been to the advantage of the Labor Party but to the advantage of the Liberal Party. So I do not think the Liberal Party was terribly displeased with the redistribution that came forward. But because of the rump that lives with it these boundary bushrangers from the National Country Party it was obliged to vote against the acceptance of that redistribution. In my view that was tragic and quite immoral. If there was objection to that redistribution proposal after it had been perused by the Parliament I do not think the issues should have been decided by the Parliament because there are impediments any objection to it should have been made to people who are above being accused of political bias, such as the judiciary. In our case I imagine we would be talking about the High Court, or a section of it, as an appropriate body to hear appeals and finally to determine the boundaries. I think the same should apply to this Commonwealth Electoral Act. The whole Bill tightens up a few nuts and bolts in line with the latest decision of the High Court. It is unfortunate that the Government bowed to the pressure of the National Country Party and introduced clause 7 into the Bill. I do not think it does anything to the Bill at all. It certainly does not improve it. It creates difficulties in an already difficult area. It certainly does not do what the National Country Party seems to be looking for all the time. Members of the Party seem to be always seeking smaller numbers of electors on the rather specious grounds in my view because their electorates are more difficult to service because of the area involved. Kalgoorlie is the largest electorate in Australia. I would not say that Kalgoorlie is the most difficult electorate in Australia to service. I believe that metropolitan electorates such as Wills or Grayndler, which are not very large electorates, would create greater difficulties in servicing than would the very large electorate of Kalgoorlie. I say that because people do not live in every nook and cranny in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. They live in centres which are connected by commercial airlines. There is no need for the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter) to charter an aircraft even. All the community centres in his electorate are served by commercial airlines. Yet members of the National Country Party put the proposition that that is a very good reason why country electorates should contain fewer people than city electorates. It is not the Labor Party that is drawing the distinction between city and country people. We look upon all people of Australia as citizens of this nation. Every one of them hopefully will be treated fairly and equally in all of the institutions of this country, and Parliament is an institution. It is members of the National Country Party who, for cheap political gain, put forward the proposition that they need to have fewer people in their electorates than are in the city electorates. This does not necessarily affect the electorate. I repeat that I will never vote in this Parliament or anywhere else against a proposition that allows people with large areas to cover facilities that, in a relatively small electorate of some 1 500 square kilometres, do not need and do not want. That does not mean that I believe that facilities should not be provided for electorates which are above the benchmark. If the benchmark is to be 5000 square kilometres then so be it. I will not argue whether it should be 5000, 10 000, 15 000 or 20 000 square kilometres. The Remuneration Tribunals report set the benchmark at 5000 square kilometres. If that is to be the benchmark the Government should make a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal to ensure that greater facilities are made available to the people who represent those areas. The Government should ensure that the majority of people in Australia are not disadvantaged by having their votes downgraded, with my vote being worth only half the vote of people in the seats of Wimmera or Mallee. That sort of situation in a democratic country such as Australia should not be tolerated. We are having it strapped upon us by clause 7 of the Bill which will perpetuate that sort of situation and even worse perpetuate it for at least 7 years at a time.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
314,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Donald Milner","9F4","Griffith","LP","N/A",459,"Many of the things said by the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) have left members in this House aghast. Many have left the chamber because of the types of comments he made. I am amazed at his reference to the seat of Kalgoorlie not having special problems. He represents 1442 square kilometres and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie represents 2 271 379 square kilometres. If the honourable member does not think that people in rural areas have troubles I simply do not think he has any capacity to sit in this chamber and to even represent metropolitan people let alone talk about the country folk. I am told by one of my colleagues that the closest thing to a country affair that the honourable member has seen was a visit, as a very young man, to the Chelsea Flower Show. Outside that he has never had any connection with rural problems.  I speak as a metropolitan member. I believe that the Labor Party and many people in this country have been hung up by folklore on this question of one vote, one value. Listening to the honourable member it is obvious that lie has never really examined the history of the tolerance provided above the quota in city seats and the tolerance provided below the quota in country electorates. I have figures here relating to the last 5 distributions of which only three have, in fact, been effected by the Parliament. In 1948 out of a total of 121 seats honourable members should not forget that this was an Australian Labor Party redistribution all but 15 of the seats were within the 10 per cent margin. In 1955 another successful redistribution; this time carried out by this side of the House all but eight of the 122 seats were within the 10 per cent margin. In 1962 a redistribution which lapsed 1 1 seats out of a total of 120 seats were outside the margin. In 1968 a total of 33 seats was outside the 10 per cent margin. Honourable members might be saying: Ha, ha, the number of seats outside the margin is growing. Let us look at the historical list. I refer to my own seat of Griffith in Queensland which the Labor Party, to its eternal shame, tried to redistribute out of existence in 197475. My seat was above the 10 per cent margin. It had the highest voting population after redistribution in 1968. It was correctly classified as an electorate with a diminishing population. It is not that everybody wanted to leave the electorate that I represent. But the facts are that there was a growth in industry and the residential area and population diminished. The Electoral Commissioners in Queensland recognised this factor at that time. From listening to members of the OppositionI carry no brief for the National Country Party one would gain the impression that every time there is a redistribution members of the National Country Party are so heavily favoured that it is a matter for us to stand up in this chamber and continually express indignation. When we look back at the history of the guidelines of redistribution we find that in 1965as I correctly reminded the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam)3 new factors were added. The first was the trend of population changes within the States. That was a sensible move. Even the Labor Government in 1975 decided that that guideline should stay, but the Labor Party eliminated the guideline concerning density or sparsity of population of a division. The Labor Party also eliminated the guideline concerning the area of a division. It is all very well for the honourable member for Burke, who has an electorate of 1442 square kilometres, to stand up and condemn the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter) or rather more directly the people of Kalgoorlie when that electorate covers some 2Va million square kilometres, or to condemn the people of the electorate of Kennedy in Queensland. This is another example of how the honourable member for Burke does not care less about the people from farflung areas. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) represents an area of almost 641 000 square kilometres. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson) represents an area of 406 000 square kilometres. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) represents an area of 503 000 square kilometres. According to the honourable member for Burke those members have no particular problems. All the Government is doing, after considerable discussion and agreement amongst the coalition parties, is recognising that the people in those areas which are at least 4 times the size of the electorate of the honourable member for Burke, do have some kind of a problem and intends inserting a clause which states that no seats which are larger than 5 000 square kilometres shall have a population larger than the smallest seat in, for instance, a city area. I do not regard that as unreasonable. I am very pleased that the AttorneyGeneral (Mr Ellicott), who represents the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers), is present. The only weakness that I see is that the composition of some seats, such as McPherson, which covers the Gold Coast, and Bowman in Queensland and some seats in other States will make it difficult for the distribution commissioners to bring those seats down to the lowest possible number, bearing in mind that they are fast growing areas. There is perfection in hardly anything, least of all the Australian Labor Party as a government. I hope that the AttorneyGeneral will take this point back to the ministry and say that the honourable member for Griffith certainly raised a most pertinent point. I think it really is about the only weakness in this Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) spent a great deal of time condemning the amendment to section 25 of the principal Act. He made special reference to the fact that 7 years must elapse before another redistribution takes place. He suggested that this was an unfortunate inclusion or alteration because the frequency of redistribution would be badly affected. I think that we should look at history to see how frequently redistributions have taken place. History highlights the weakness of the arguments of the Leader of the Opposition. If we disregard the redistribution in 1900, before the Commonwealth Parliament was officially proclaimed, and if we exclude those rare occasions such as in 1974 when a redistribution took place in Western Australia alone, generally speaking there were successful redistributions in 1906, 1913, 1922, 1934, 1949, 1955 and 1968. There was a gap of 12 years between the 1922 redistribution and the 1934 redistribution, and a gap of 15 years between the 1934 redistribution and the 1949 redistribution.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

319,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SCHOLES, Gordon","5J4","Corio","N/A","N/A",461,"Redistributions are something which no individual politician and few parties like. Unfortunately they are necessary. The terms under which redistributions are carried out can have very substantial effects. It is possible to carry out a redistribution which, to all intents and purposes, has the appearance of being fair but which in effect can give a government a margin which makes it almost impossible for it to be defeated. I instance the situation in Victoria where a redistribution, with a fairly substantial swing, would allow the Australian Labor Party to obtain a position very close to government but which would require something more than extraordinary to win the three or four seats above that swing to enable it to obtain office. Electoral boundaries, electoral redistributions and elections should give the people the opportunity to change government where they wish to have a change. The skill of the manipulator prevents that. A redistribution retains the illusion, whilst creating situations where the wishes of the people cannot be reflected in the results of an election. It was truly said on an earlier occasion that it is not the way that the people vote but the way that the people s votes are counted that matters. In many respects that is the major opposition to this particular proposal. If, for instance, a large electorate was said to be an electorate of over 50 000 square kilometres objections most likely would be lower and less stringent. If the provisions of the Act were that where 25 per cent of the electorates in a State went 10 per cent above or below the quota, a redistribution would take place and then the proposal may be more acceptable.  The 3 major proposals in this Bill have a cummulative effect. I do not consider some of the electorates at the bottom of the table electorates consisting of 5000 square kilometres to be large electorates. I know that the members of at least two of them would not qualify for an overnight allowance by driving 150 kilometres from their homes. Those members cannot qualify for that overnight allowance because that distance does not exist within their electorate. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) referred to the difficulties of his own electorate. He is one of those members who cannot in fact qualify for an overnight allowance by driving 150 kilometresthat is about 95 miles in his electorate. In this day and age that is not a lengthy distance. At least two other Victorian electorates which come within the ambit of the 5000 square kilometre proposal are the seats of McMillan and Ballarat. Those electorates have an area of about 60 miles by 40 miles I will use miles because I am more familiar with them. Not more than 50 miles need be travelled by the members of those electorates to qualify for an allowance. I do not believe that electorates of this type are of a size which warrants the special protection which is proposed in this Bill. In the case of the electorate of Ballaarat something like 80 per cent of the electors are within 10 miles of the city of Ballarat which is the centre of population. Ballaarat is substantially an urban electorate with some rural annexes. Although it is an important electorate, it could hardly be declared or considered a large electorate in geographical terms when we compare it to electorates such as Kalgoorlie. The cumulative effect of the legislation brings about a time distortion in electorates. It requires the commissioners to ignore the growth factors in electorates. In Victoria the commissioners took into consideration the growth factors of, for example, the electorates of Burke and Diamond Valley and placed them 7 per cent below a quota, which was the case in the 1974 distribution, they would also have to place another 9 electorates 7 per cent below a quota because that is how many electorates are said to be large electorates. I dispute that those 9 electorates are in fact large electorates. They are all larger than my electorate but they are certainly not large by any criteria that could be applied to the national Parliament Nine other electorates have to be loaded down. There are 8 rapid growth electorates in Victoria at the moment and there will be 9 after the redistribution because certainly the fringes of Melbourne will warrant an additional electorate. Once the commissioners take one area which is not over 500 square kilometres 7 per cent below a quota they will have to take 18 electorates down. That is the son of long term effect that this legislation will have. Figures which can be quoted at the moment have a builtin distortion because electorates between 1968 and the present time include 18, 19 and 20 year olds who were enrolled by Act of Parliament. Therefore these figures do not represent the normal growth in electorates. They distort the situation in that they show electorates with a growth factor which in fact did not have a growth factor. If the normal pattern of electorates takes place certain of them will be loaded down by this proposition. Some of them would have been loaded down anyhow because of their area. The commissioners have fairly consistently taken into consideration the disabilities of members in what are genuinely large electorates. Those will decline below the quota fairly quickly. The growth electorate will move past the quota, at the rate some of them are growing, within 12 months of the distribution being adopted. Most likely some of them would have moved to that stage by the time the distribution has been completed because there is a time lag of nearly a year between the release of the figures and the adoption of the recommendation. It is proposed that there should be a period of 7 years between redistributions. It is just over 7 years since the last redistribution. In Victoria the 2 smallest electorates of Wimmera and Mallee added together have only 7000 more voters than the electorate of Burke. They have only 10 per cent more voters than the electorate of Burke. This is a ratio of one for two. In Queensland the 2 smallest electorates have 10 000 electors fewer than the electorate of McPherson. We are recreating and multiplying that situation by the 3 joint propositions in this legislation. Electorates of over 5000 square kilometres have a maximum size equal to the minimum size of any other electorate. This is a distortion in that there are electorates which under the normal redistribution proposals would be expected to be loaded down for growth. I am not talking about inner metropolitan electorates about which much play has been made. Usually they are declining electorates but are almost always set above a quota. I think that the Liberal Party has fallen for the 3 card trick. It would have been most likely better off if it had accepted a straight out proposition of 7 large electorates at 20 per cent. I would have thought it would have been immoral. But electorally this arrangement would have been more practical for the distribution commissioners and it would have given a more honest reflection of what the Government is trying to say. What the Government has in fact said is that we will have 2 types of members in this Parliament those who have special electoral laws applied to them and others who do not. If the commissioners use the variations electorates in the inner metropolitan areas in all probability will find themselves 8 per cent to 10 per cent above a quota. If we load half the electorates in the States that is the situation in New South Wales and Victoria if we allow for the growth in large areas as is proposed, and as would be expected and if we make these allowances half the electorates in a State will be affected by the 5000 square kilometre proposition one way or the other. They will be affected also by the 7 year redistribution proposition. Then we have to consider the cumulated deficit which we have allowed for those electorates and add that deficit to the remainder. The remainder is not that big. I have added it for the inner metropolitan Labor areas in Victoria. At 5 per cent above a quota I would expect that this provision would most likely end up with 8 per cent above a quota being required there is something like an 89 000 vote deficit in the area. That represents one electorate in 20 000 electors. The same cumulative deficit exists in both the Labor and Liberal areas of inner Sydney. The position is almost identical in the Liberal areas in Melbourne because there is very little difference in the populations between one area and another. Everyone recognises those are to have additions. Most likely they would need 50 000 to 60 000 people to get them back up to the quota and with the same degree of loading. The cumulative effect of these 3 measures will mean that those electorates will be well above what they should normally have been. Others will be loaded down, not because of their size, not because of any consideration the commissioners would normally have given that sort of loading but because of some other electorate which has no relevance at all. I use an obvious example in Victoria. If the electorate of Burke is loaded down to allow it to be a reasonable size half way through the period of redistribution, Ballaarat has to be loaded down with it for no other reason than that the electorate of Burke will grow rapidly. Ballaarat is not a large seat. This Bill will attach what happens in Ballaarat to what happens in another seat, and apply a redistribution factor to it which has no relevance to it and which will have the effect of adding possibly 5000 voters to another seat in the metropolitan area which should not have those 5000 voters, except that they happen to be left over when the sums for the special treatment seats are concluded. The other result I would hope this is the type of result the Commissioners will in fact adoptthat can come from these proposals is that the Commissioners will use their discretion in seats like Darling, Kalgoorlie, and Leichhardt, the very large seats, and ignore differentials in the other seats, especially in the metropolitan areas, and give them about a quota each. I am not sure that that would satisfy the Country Party and I think we would even have the threat of an election at large. That is the only practical solution under the existing terms because there is not one proposal or 2 proposals but 3 proposals. I think the area of 5000 square kilometres is a serious mistake, even on the policies the Government is trying to put. If it had adopted a figure of 50 000 or even 20 000, most likely it would have been a better proposition. I would suggest that there is no way that special treatment can be warranted in an electorate 60 miles by 40 miles. That is not an extremely large electorate in Australian or any other terms. It does not warrant special treatment, but it is to get special treatment purely because it happens to be covered by a tribunal report made by people looking at a different set of criteria. As I said before, the member in such an electorate would not even qualify for an overnight allowance because he would not be able to travel the required distance in his electorate. This Bill should be withdrawn. It is not required for the redistribution. The existing Act would allow a redistribution to go ahead. The Government, if the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) is to be believed, is able to influence the Commissioners. I doubt that myself. I saw the last Victorian redistribution. Whilst I did well out of it, I am not sure that the Australian Labor Party did. I think that Commissioners, once appointed, do their jobs conscientiously. They do it within the guidelines which governments and parliaments lay down, which may be crook. I think the Commissioners are at least men of integrity and try to do the job they are given. The suggestion that is regularly made that such and such a party made a redistribution is not one which I accept. I know that political parties will always seek to influence. Why not? There are advantages in redistribution far greater than the advantages to be gained in elections. Ask the Premier of Queensland. On or two other things in this Bill ought to be considered. One is the proposition of at large elections. There are no rules by which such elections shall be conducted. The AttorneyGeneral (Mr Ellicott) will remember a case not that far back when no opportunity would have existed for the Parliament to provide at large provisions. In those circumstances there was a possibility that the definition of towards the end of a term might have been challenged in the courts at a time when the Parliament had in fact been dissolved. I do not think that is the sort of situation into which any nation can allow itself to be brought. I do not know what the legal result of such a situation would be. Towards the end of the Parliament is a pretty open statement. It would seem to me that something should be written into the Act to define the words. I think the words are actually towards the end of the life of the Parliament. They come from the High Court judgment, which is delightfully vague on the question.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would hope there could be no situation in which such an election could take place because, no matter how it was conducted, it would be a distortion of the process by which this House is normally elected or expected to be elected. It certainly would create serious difficulties in the reassembly of a Parliament and the counting of votes. Most likely the reassembly of Parliament, the issues of writs, etc, could not take place within the terms of the Commonwealth Electoral Act as it exists.  I hope the AttorneyGeneral will take notice of one of the things the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) said and consider a provision for an automatic acceptance of redistribution proposals. I do not believe it is proper that a redistribution should depend on it being acceptable to the party with the majority of votes at any given election. As I said when I first stood up, redistribution is unpalatable to members of Parliament. I would like to see Commissioners appointed with the approval of both sides of the Parliament. I do not think that should be beyond the imagination of man. It should be possible to send their report to the Parliament and for it to be sent back for a review if it is thought not be suitable and the review should follow the same procedures as in other reviews. The Commissioners should consider the objections and decide whether they should be accepted. The report could then become law. In 1962, for example, it was improper that when one seat disappeared in New South Wales there was not a redistribution. The honourable member for Griffith pointed out how sparse redistributions have been in the past. I think for political reasons and not for practical reasons that has been the case. The laws governing elections and distributions are too important to be tied up in this sort of compromise. The recent High Court judgment was in fact a blow at the Government, which rushed through legislation in 1965 after it had lost control of the Senate but before the new senators took office, to provide what has now been declared to be an illegal means of setting the number of members or determining the quotas for members in this House. It is something which should be seriously considered. These propositions cumulatively are not good propositions and do not reflect a situation which this Parliament can support.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

G. Whitlam) are in conflict again. It has become apparent in this debate that the honourable member for Corio believes the Bill is not necessary. Yet the Leader of the Opposition in his opening remarks suggested that we had waited too long. He suggested that the McKellar case was such that we should have brought in legislation earlier. I thought the legislation was introduced as the result of the High Court decision in the McKellar case.  Let me refer to a few remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. He, and all honourable members opposite who have spoken thus far, seem to have great concern and fear about the proposed amendment to section 19 purely and simply because of its reference to 5000 square kilometres. Suggestions have been made throughout this debate that the legislation of Labors Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Daly, was fair and just and that it gave representation on the basis of one vote one value. Surely the basis of the legislation as it was proposed was that electoral divisions should be considered on the basis of people, be they eligible to vote, be they babies, or be they aliens. I do not see how members of the Opposition can stand here today and justify that as being equality, and on the other hand suggest that an electorate like Kalgoorlie, which is 2.2 million square kilometres, does not have some true representation in this House as against an electorate like Grayndler, to which reference has been made. I represent an inner city electorate of Sydney, the electorate of Evans. There are 63 000 persons enrolled in my division but there are 101 000 residents. I represent the 101 000, whether they are shown on the electoral roll or not. But I do not for one moment suggest that I would like to move out of that area into 2.2 million square kilometres and find I had the same opportunity. I am sure that the people in Kalgoorlie would not get the same service from my office or indeed from me.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Some people would argue that our system is not representative because it does not embody for this House proportional or other forms of representation. All I can say to that is that our system is democratic and, in this Jubilee year, might I say that I hope it will endure as a system of consititutional monarchy for a long time. But it will survive only if we maintain and enhance its democratic values at a time when democratic values and the things which accompany them such as human rights and civil liberties are disappearing extremely quickly around the globe. From memory, only about 25 of the 140odd individual independent nations of the world are exceptionally democratic with independent parliaments and with judiciaries. There are 115 or so regimes which need a strong democratic example such as we have in Australia. This Bill helps to give to this country a strong democratic representation in this place. Essentially, our system is a blend of the single constituency preferential 2party system in the House of Representatives and of proportional representation in the Senate. That gives the people of this country the opportunity to have two bites at the cherry, or rather to enjoy the whole cherry.  The other aspect which is subject to controversy is the question of preferential voting, which thankfully is still embodied in the main Act. My attitude to it is that such a scheme maximises opportunities in the selection of candidates. The simplest way of explaining it is to say that under preferential voting, where the choice is wide, the scaling of priorities among candidates by citizens is a most natural selection, like everything else we do. For the benefit of Opposition members, I point out that in the morning we get up and choose our clothes. Some members might have the opportunity to go to their stores to pick out some bright clothes in which to come to this House. But we have a choice. It has been said about this legislation that there is going to be a 7 year lapse between redistributions. Surely the legislation itself ensures that there will be a review each year based upon population.

I do not see for one moment how any member of this House or any member of the public, for that matter, could understand that. Surely it is within the Act itself. Each and every year, based upon population, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer will look at the situation. That does not necessarily guarantee that there will be a distribution, and I am sure I would not like to be subjected to that. However, if there is substantial movement within the population in that 12 months period there will be a redistribution. That will then make this House contemporary and in tune with population shifts. In regard to population shifts, the Borrie report, which was published recently, indicates a slowing down in our population growth, and therefore the number of electors, excluding migrants, will be reduced. There will still be significant population shifts, of course. The Borrie report and the latest census do not mean less need for regular redistributions because of urban shifts within cities. As evidence of that we have to look only at the inner city of Sydney, the far western suburbs and other growth areas, although that process is now in doubt because the trend is to return to urban areas. I know that in my own electorate there is a changing pattern, with people coming in and going out. Each and every year there would be a change, with some 10 000 to 15 000 people coming in and going out.  Following the McKinlay and McKellar cases, a new provision has been inserted in this legislation, and again I wish to quote the Ministers words: if a State has not been divided into the appropriate number of divisions which accords with the determined representation entitlement, that ordinary general election Wu be conducted at large for that State. This means that the State will be regarded as one division and the members, to the number as determined, will be elected for that one division. I have presumed that as the words at large do not apply in extraordinary or double dissolution elections, elections cannot be contrived to take advantage of proportional representation but I do believe the at large provision ought now to be more clearly denned. The Minister in introducing the legislation indicated that there should be a review of the guidelines which the Distribution Commissioners are required to take into account in their consideration of proposed distributions. I would like to suggest to the Minister that during this inquiry examination should be made of the question of making it mandatory for the position of Distribution Commissioner to be held by persons from the judiciary. Although it is not necessarily comparing like with like there is similarity between this idea and the way parliamentarians salaries are now determined by an independent tribunal. That is one case. There can then be a sense of complete independence about it. Similarly, with judicial appointments, complete independence would seem to have been achieved.

The members of my Party are not trying to take my seat from me but nevertheless I am sure that as the honourable member has survived for a long time in his own Party he can survive a bit longer. In regard to the introduction of the Bill and the claim that it has been politically inspired, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) went back through history to illustrate that the number of redistributions over the years has been rather small. So the proposal by the Opposition in its Bill to have a redistribution every 3 years under our Bill there will be a redistribution every 7 years would have forced on the Australian people unnecessary wasteful redistributions. The honourable member for Griffith said that as a member he would not know where he was going. He said that his constituents would not know from year to year who their member was. Consequently the Oppositions proposals would have had only political implications because they sought to have boundary changes to give them some political advantage.  I would like to refer again to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. Basically he said that in 1974 the Labor Party had proposed a Bill which provided that all people should have equal representation by the creation of a division that had a tolerance of no more or less than 10 per cent of the quota. Where has our Bill gone wrong in that respect? Surely that is the very provision that the Leader of the Opposition wanted to have incorporated in the Act in 1975. This Bill before the House does provide for a tolerance of no more or less than 10 per cent of the quota. So much for his argument. Is it that the intention of the Opposition in opposing this Bill is purely and simply one of political motivation to try to drive a wedge between the National Country Party and the Liberal Party? Is that the reason for opposing the Bill? I believe that the Opposition has no more concern for the people of Australia and their representation by members in this House than for putting the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) out of this House without a job. The previous speaker the honourable member for Burke said that the electorate of Kalgoorlie is not a difficult area to service. He compared it with the seat of Grayndler. I would like just to go back and compare the electorate of Evans with the electorate of Kalgoorlie. Each and every year in my electorate there are something like 5000 naturalisations. They spread out of my electorate. I have some 600 social engagements. My correspondence runs into tens of thousands of letters. I am able to service my area from 2 offices situated in my electorate which encompasses roughly 25 square miles. How could the honourable member for Burke suggest that I could move out of my area into Kalgoorlie and service it in the same manner as I do now? The electorate of Kalgoorlie would have the same population as the electorate of Evans, not necessarily the same number of enrolled electors but the same population. There are problems there but not because of a bowing to pressure as charged by the honourable member for Burke and, I think, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). There is no bowing to pressure from the National Country Party. It is a matter of reality and sanity that we must give representation to the people of Australia. This Bill is urgently needed. It is urgently needed to ensure that the people are given proper and correct representation. It is urgently needed to ensure that there are not wanton redistributions for political purposes each and every 3 years. This Bill is badly needed to correct the matters that were recently found to be invalid by the High Court. I support the Bill and I commend it to the House.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is a rather wordy description, but in essence it means that this legislation will continue to maintain the principle that some people in the community are entitled to bias in their favour to make up for some deficiency that exists within their electorate.  I agree with the honourable member for Evans that the person who represents a seat like Kalgoorlie and the person who represents a seat like Evans, a small inner city seat, have disadvantages but we on this side of the House have always expressed the view that those disadvantages should be compensated for by giving the person greater access to the electorate by way of travel facilities, increased staff and so on. I am one who would be quite happy to see members living in very large electorates given almost unlimited assistance. But the point I want to take up with previous speakers and in particular the honourable member for Evans, is that once we depart from a principle of equality of votes where does it end? We now have a 10 per cent tolerance either way. We used to have a 20 per cent tolerance. Now we have this 5000 square kilometre criterion. There is nothing to stop a government that has control of the numbers in the House of Representatives and in the Senate from passing legislation which makes the difference virtually anything it likes20 per cent, 30 per cent, 50 per cent or 1000 per cent. If the Government has the numbers it can do it, and of course, it has been done in the various States. That is what concerns me. What happens if there should be an autocratic, authoritarian government which decides that it will lose the next election, whips through a redistribution and stops what we call the democratic process. I am one of those people who have seen the evils committed by Labor Governments in Queensland and I do not think that all Labor governments in the past have been saints. I am not referring to this House because in the past the very few redistributions that have been undertaken by Labor governments in the federal sphere have been very fair, but some State Labor governments have done equally bad things. It has been done in Western Australia, Victoria and most of the other States barring Tasmania, which has the one truly democratic State Legislative Assembly because it has a proportional representation system. What concerns me is that a government can do this. It can go ahead and redistribute itself into government more or less ad infinitum and we have seen it done in the other States. The simple fact is that even if the Labor Party did get the majority vote I agree that at the moment it would not be a legitimate government in Queensland, Western Australia or Victoria because it does not have the majority vote it still could not win office. It could not win in any of those 3 States if it obtained 50.1 per cent of the vote. All I ask in this democratic country is that if a party obtains the majority vote, it be in government. The history of this Parliament is that there is a bias in favour of the Liberal National Country Party coalition. It is not enormous. It is nothing like the bias that exists in Queensland but it is enough to deny the Labor Party government when the result is close.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It won an overwhelming majority at the last election in 1976. 1 am arguing about the legitimacy of the Government in 1954, 1961 and 1969. The result in 1954 was not the fault of the LiberalCountry Party coalition. It was the fault of the Labor Government which drew up the boundaries in 1949. The worst Gerrymander against the Labor Party was done by the Labor Party in 1949. But it has been maintained by succeeding governments and in 1 96 1 the Labor Party should have been the legitimate government. It had a clear mandate from the people but it failed to win because of the electoral system, not the malapportionment which gave the other side an inbuilt majority of three or four seats. In 1969 it was touch and go. The Labor Party lacked a majority my recollection is that it was by 7 seats yet it obtained a majority of the vote. In 1972 the Labor Party should have won by a greater number of seats than it did and in 1974 it should have obtained a bigger majority than 5 seats. I suppose it is a pointless exercise, but I believe that I am a true democrat. I believe that if the other side of the House wins, it should be the government and alternatively, if this side wins, it should be the government.  I think that this Bill is an improvement on the past although I do not like a lot of things contained in it, for which the Opposition will oppose it. It is an improvement because at least the 10 per cent variation that the Labor Party introduced when in government has been maintained. Eventually in this country I want to see the power to change the electoral laws and the power to undertake redistributions taken out of the hands of politicians. There ought to be a statutory authority. The Electoral Office should be a statutory authority employing permanent public servants to draw up electoral boundaries which they present to the Parliament and which cannot be changed by the Parliament. Seats should be decided by the law of one vote, one value, as they are decided by the Constitution, and whatever boundaries are drawn up by the Electoral Office, whether it be at three or five or sevenyear intervals, should be the ones that apply. The elections would be fought on that basis. Some of the things that were said about the Labor Partys redistribution were outrageous. Some members of this House who are now on the Government side stomped the country and told grotesque untruths about the redistribution and yet all political scientists of repute in Australiapeople who really understand what redistributions aresaid that the Federal redistribution undertaken by the Labor Government was eminently fair. Malcolm Mackerras, a man who was previously a member of the Liberal Party and is one of Australias most eminent political scientists said that it was an extremely fair redistribution and that it redressed the bias that had existed in past redistributions. But Government supporters, who were then in opposition, stomped the country. They made claims that were simply outrageous that the Labor Party was putting forward electoral processes that would keep it permanently in office. They were able to do this because the vast majority of the population do not understand redistributions. That is not to their discredit. The vast majority of politicians understand what is happening but if one asks them to explain what effect a distribution has in each individual electorate or State, they could not do it. A member will know what is happening in his electorate and in the neighbouring electorate probably there is selfinterest involved in that but he does not really have the knowledge, nor does he take the time, to study every single electorate closely to see whether it is 100 per cent fair. If he does not do it there is no way in the world that the general population will undertake that sort of study. I doubt whether there are 100 people in the nation who could sit down and look at a redistribution and say accurately whether it is fair or unfair. They would have to work on somebody elses interpretation of that redistribution. Another important point that I want to make is that I wish that the Government had the courage to go to the people to reintroduce the question of the breaking of the nexus between the Senate and the House of Representatives.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

345,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"COHEN, Barry","NF4","N/A","N/A","N/A",468,"The honourable member for Denison says that the people threw it out. That is quite right. If honourable members cast their minds back to that 1967 referendum, they will recall that the Government did not introduce legislation to increase the size of the House. It first went to the people and some Democratic Labor Party and independent senators conducted a quite dishonest campaign amongst the people of Australia, saying that the Government was trying to increase the numbers of members of Parliament. It was not. The Government can, as we all know, increase the size of the House of Representatives tomorrow. It is within its powers and it could do it tomorrow if it introduced the legislation. However, of course, it has to increase the size of the Senate. What the Government, supported by the Labor Party, was trying to do in 1967 was to increase the size of the House of Representatives without increasing the size of the Senate. It was, in fact, a referendum to decrease in the long term the number of politicians but these quite dishonest politicians went out, campaigned and reversed the question. The proposal did not get much support from the media and it was defeated. If, as the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) says, it is not possible to change that question and that we would have the same sort of dishonest arguments if we went to the people again, the answer should be to increase the size of the Senate.  To me it is patently absurd that in 1949 there were 123 members of the House of Representatives and that 28 to 30 years later there will still be 123 members. If we are concerned about the size of some seats, surely the best way is to increase them. I do not want to see any country seat abolished. I do not want to see a decrease in the number of country seats by maintaining the number at 123 and because of the increase in the urban population. It will make the seats that we now have bigger and bigger. This must go on. Kalgoorlie will get bigger and Kennedy, Leichhardt and all other country seats will get bigger. What is wrong with increasing the size of the House of Representatives to 144 members and increasing Senate representation to 12 senators from each State? The argument against that proposition is that the result of Senate elections will always be a 3:3 split and so you will never get a decision. I think that is nonsense. At the last double dissolution election everyone said that the Labor Party had to achieve a 5:5 result. We achieved that result in one State and the result was 6:4 in every other State. What could be done is simply to divide the States into electorates for the purpose of Senate elections. They could be divided into 6 electorates; they could be divided into 2 electorates. If they were divided into 2 electorates, that could be done by having half the population in each and having 3 senators elected from each part. In the case of Queensland, 3 senators could come from, say, the north and 3 senators could be elected from the southern part of the State. Frankly, I think it would be a better thing if senators, instead of just representing a whole State, represented a particular area which was more of interest to them. There are all sorts of combinations and computations. But we are stuck with 123 members because of what Malcolm Mackerras described as the High Court lunacy when referring to its recent ruling. I am surprised that the Liberal and Country Parties have not looked at that possibility. It has been said that a government would be scared of public disapproval if it increased the number of politicians. Surely we have got enough gumption to go to the people and say: We are going to increase the size of the House of Representatives from 123 to 144 members, or something like that After 30 years surely we can justify a small increase in the size of this House. The States are doing it. Every time they have a redistribution, which is every 3 or 4 years, they add a couple of electorates. If there is an argument for fewer politicians, it ought to be an argument for fewer State politicians. As the member for Robertson, I represent the Gosford Wyong area which has a population of 90 000. There are almost 3 State electorates within my boundaries, and the State members who represent those electorates have the same salary and almost the same conditions as I have. Who has the easier job? The New South Wales Legislative Assembly has 99 members, which is almost as many as represent the whole of Australia in this place. I think that the situation is patently absurd. Finally I want to express my concern to the AttorneyGeneral (Mr Ellicott) about this question of the election at large. I am surprised that nothing more specific has been spelt out in that regard. Perhaps the AttorneyGeneral is proposing that some subsequent legislation will be introduced to clarify the position. I understand that the Chief Australian Electoral Officer does not know what he would do if there were an election at large. I am also concerned at the possibility of an unscrupulous government at some stage or other deliberately deciding that it will not carry out a redistribution and have an election at large because it may benefit from it Let me give an example. In 1969, 1972 and 1974 New South Wales strongly voted for the Labor Party. In 1972 we got about 27 or 28 of the 45 seats in that State. Let us assume that we had narrowly missed out on achieving office and that the present Government was in power and it decided that if an election at large were held it could be assured, under proportional representationthis is what I assume an election at large would be because I cannot see any other way of doing it of about 42 per cent to 45 per cent of the vote. That means it must get almost half of the seats. So a government could decide not to carry out a redistribution in a particular State because it was assured of picking up 4 or 5 seats in an election at large. Maybe I am drawing the long bow; maybe I am looking at obscure possibilities; but it is a distinct possibility, and it concerns me.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
346,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HODGMAN, Michael","BV4","Denison","N/A","N/A",469,"I would like to commence my remarks by congratulating the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) on an extremely fair and a very good speech. I must concede that I do not agree with all of the specifics of his speech, but I completely concur with the sentiments he expressed. Not the least of the kind remarks he made was the comment that Tasmania is a truly democratic State. I take some pleasure in hearing that, because it does happen to be the truth. It is in the spirit, not only of being a Liberal but also as one who believes in the democratic process, that I congratulate the Government on the introduction of these electoral measures. They are, in my submission, good legislation, fair legislation and, above all, democratic legislation. I would not wish it to be thought by the public at large that these Bills come into the Parliament today only because of decisions taken by the High Court in McKinlays case and in McKellars case. Granted, it could be said that those decisions, particularly the latter, have perhaps prompted or speeded up the legislative process. But I hope that men of goodwill on both sides of this House will have come to the conclusion that the sorts of amendment proposals which are now before the chamber are fair and appropriate in the democratic parliamentary system that we have in this country in 1977.  It seems, with respect, that the question of electoral redistribution has always been, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Robertson, a matter of political controversy. Like the honourable member, I find it very sad that far too often the public believes that we fiddle with electoral boundaries for the purpose of electoral advantage. The sooner we can get electoral redistribution away from the political scene and out of the hands of politicians so that the public will see that it is not being done for the purpose of gerrymandering or arranging electoral advantage, but that it is for the purpose of achieving fair and democratic representation for all Australians, the sooner the standing of this Parliament will be greatly enhanced in the eyes of the community. In the past the procedures for redistribution of the House of Representatives boundaries have provided that, on the basis of the 5yearly census population figures, The Chief Australian Electoral Officer determined, according to a set formula, the representation entitlements of each State. In the 2 High Court decisions to which I have referred, and after consideration of section 24 of the Constitution, the Court expressed the view that the words whenever necessary which appear in section 24 mean that the number of members to be chosen in the several States must be determined in time for each ordinary general election and that such election must be held in accordance with the entitlements so determined. However, the Court recognised that that mandatory principle would not apply in the case of elections other than ordinary general elections. What basically then does this legislation do? In my respectful submission, it contemporises population movements in Australia with the electorate and with the democratic process. It is proper that the determining of electoral redistribution should be done in time for the next ordinary general election. The effect of the High Courts decision embodied in this legislation is that in the twelth month of every Parliament I put it in simple terms because I believe that if it is [nit in simple terms it is more likely that the pubic will accept this as a genuine measure or series of measures rather than as a politican exercisethe Chief Australian Electoral Officer, on the basis of the latest available population statistics, which he has to obtain from the Australian Statistician, will make a determination as to the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen for each State and forward that determination to the Minister. If that determination discloses that there should be an alteration to the number of members of the House of Representatives for any State, then the required redistribution will be proceeded with and on that redistribution the electors will cast their votes to choose those members who will form the Government in the next Parliament. I want to say from the outset that anybody who has studied the Bills or the Constitution will readily appreciate that it is unlikely for a very long period of time that these provisions will have any direct effect on the State of Tasmania. I must, in fairness, concede that nobody in this Parliament has attacked the position of Tasmania. But there were whispers in the corridors of a conspiracy to suggest that Tasmanian representation should be reduced. But I draw attention to the fact that the founding fathers, in their wisdom, ensured that Tasmania which is, as the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) mentioned, an original State, would have 5 seats in the House of Representatives. Please God, nobody will ever be stupid enough to suggest that that representation should be reduced, let alone attempt to reduce it. Tasmania has enough problems of gravity without our adding to them by reducing the number of representatives it has in this Parliament a mere 5 representatives out of the enormity of those who come from the major States of New South Wales and Victoria. Consequently, it is going to be many years before we will fit into the category of being subject to these legislative proposals. Lest people who are listening to the broadcast of this debate believe that Tasmania is receiving some extremely unjust or unfair advantage, I refer briefly to the 10 per cent variant and to the situation as it at present pertains. I think the former AttorneyGeneral, now Mr Justice Murphy, spoke very frankly on the 10 per cent variation when, in the Senate on 10 April 1973, he said:","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that in fairness one should record that it was the previous Government which brought to this nation the 10 per cent variant. It is one of the few good things which it did with respect to electoral reform. Some people in the electorate, for a multitude of reasons, would condemn anything the Whitlam Government did on electoral reform or anything else. I believe that the Whitlam Government took proper and reasonable action in this respect. I am glad that the 10 percent variant has now been written into our electoral system and will become a permanent feature of it.  I want to put on record the situation which applies in relation to quotas so that people who may not know the situation as it applies to Tasmania will not run away with the idea that we are one section of Australia which is receiving special favoured treatment which makes a mockery of democracy. I draw to the attention of this chamber that the Tasmania quota, as it stood at December 1976, was 52 103 persons per electorate. That is only 7000 persons fewer than the quota for the 2 House of Representatives seats in the Australian Capital Territory. It is 12 000 persons more than the quota for the one seat in this House for the Northern Territory. Using a rough rule of thumb, I do not believe that that variation from the quota is so bad that people could say that Tasmania received such fair or preferential treatment that it distorts the democratic process. I am particularly proud of the fact that in Tasmania at present indeed this has been the case for some time our electorates are all below the 10 per cent variant. So even if we were in a situation populationwise that would qualify us for the provisions of this legislation the 10 per cent or 20 per cent variant would have no effect whatsoever. Indeed, looking at the official figures for 197475 with respect to this very House, of the 126 seats, as at 197475, 121 of the divisions were inside the 10 per cent variant margin. Two seats were between a 10 per cent and a 15 per cent variation and one seat was between a 15 per cent and a 20 per cent variation. That was prior to the amendment to a 10 per cent variant by the Whitlam Government. In Tasmania in 1 948 all 5 seats were inside the 10 per cent margin. In 1955 the electoral redistribution had the effect of putting two of those 5 seats between the 10 per cent and 15 percent bracket. The 1962 redistribution proposals lapsed. The 1968 proposals, which were effected, had all 5 Tasmanian seats below the 10 per cent variant. Under 1975 proposals, which were rejected, we would still have retained all the Tasmanian seats within the 10 per cent variant. The mean deviation from the quota in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan divisions as proposed by the distribution commissioners in 1955, 1962, 1968, and 197475 is made very easy to understand by a table which, in fact, was presented in the Senate and incorporated in the Hansard for that House on Wednesday 23 February 1977 at page 319.I seek your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, as to whether it is possible for that table to appear in our Hansard.

In the nonmetropolitan 3 seats, the variant was minus 0.64 per cent less than one per cent. I do not intend to speculate in my remarks as to the possible redistribution that may or may not occur in Tasmania. I simply say that the Tasmania electorate is a somewhat skinny animal and there is not going to be much opportunity to vary the boundaries anyway.

It may well be that the distribution commissioners in their wisdom will take the view that the boundaries should remain as they are. I do not intend to proffer any comment or advice.

I say to the honourable member for Sydney that I am not frightened of the democratic process and I will not directly involve myself in what boundaries are applicable when the House of Representatives next goes to the people.  Some extraordinary comments were made in another place. The Standing Orders do not permit me to debate what went on in the other place. Those who would like to see how a debate can get completely and absolutely interrupted by political considerations ought to look at some of the speeches made by senators which appear in yesterdays Senate Hansard. Fortunately the debate in this place has been kept above politics. I believe this has produced a better debate. The only other matter to which I want to refer is proposed new subsections (2) and (3) of section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. They deal with guidelines to be laid down on the question of distribution. The matter which is undoubtedly exercising the minds of honourable members opposite for some reason I do not understand, is the provision relating to electorates which are in excess of 5000 square kilometres. I believe that the honourable member for Wimmera put the case very fairly and very well in his remarks earlier today. I am absolutely staggered that the Opposition is prepared to contend that in some way this provision is unjust or even undemocratic. This seems to me to be a total failure on the part of the Opposition to recognise the problems which confront those who represent rural electorates. When one thinks of it, 500 square kilometres is not really a very large area but it is big enough to involve perhaps one and a half times the activity that is required of a member in a metropolitan seat. I am not saying that country members work one and a half times harder than city members but I point out that they have a higher proportion of dead timenamely, travelling, waiting, making arrangement for transportation etc. that metropolitan members as a rule do not have to suffer. All this proposal provides, and I believe fairly, is that no situation will occur whereby a member representing an electorate which is in excess of 5000 square kilometres shall have more electors than the smallest electorate below 5000 square kilometres. It is bad enough in some cases for a member to have a large electorate an electorate which is so immense in size that he is preoccupied with travelling and distance without inflicting upon that member the burden of having larger numbers of electors to look after than his city counterparts. I believe the provision is fair. I cannot for the life of me understand the objection of the Opposition to it particularly in view of the fact that the Opposition from time to time in recent years has represented rural electorates. The honourable member for Wimmera made the point that Labor Party members have not represented enough rural electorates for so long a period of time that they have forgotten the problems that face rural electorates. In Tasmania the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) has one of the most difficult electorates to handle. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) has an electorate which extends right down the west coast of Tasmania and takes in King Island. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) has to travel long distances. The new provision will affect two of those electorates. It is a fair proposition. I commend the Government for it. Overall the 3 Bills are fair, just and, above all, democratic. I believe that they deserve the support of all honourable members in this chamber. Mr KING(Wimmera) I wish to make a personal explanation.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

369,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"JOHNSON, Leslie","K9M","Hughes","ALP","5.41",473,"The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill together with those subsidiary Bills passed last night have been introduced for two principal reasons. The first reason in my view is to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and subsidiary legislation to take account of the decision of the High Court in the 2 constitutional cases decided in December and early this month. The second reason is to introduce yet another method of protecting the National Country Party from political annihilation. While the Government may justly claim a responsibility to legislate to cover the former, neither the High Courts decisions nor the Governments election rhetoric justify the latter. Only the preservation instincts of the National Country Party members who so envy the gerrymander perpetrated in Queensland justify the inclusion m this legislation of the amendment protecting large electorates. I will have more to say on that aspect in just a few moments.  The 2 decisions of the High Court that have necessitated the amendments now proposed by the Government both concern the interpretation of section 24 of the Constitution. That section provides and was given legislative effect by section 10 of the Representation Act of 1905 that a number equal to twice the number of senators is to be divided into the number of the people of the Commonwealth as ascertained by census but excluding those citizens who reside in the Territories. This quota is then divided into the population of each State to ascertain the number of seats each State is entitled to have. Until 1964, when a previous LiberalCountry Party Government introduced amendments to the Representation Act to the effect that any remainder over the quota entitled a State to another member, additional members were provided only where the quota was exceeded by 50 per cent. In the first of the two recently decided cases, Western Australia against the Commonwealth it is known as McKinlays case and was decided in December in 1975 the High Court held that section 24 of the Constitution intended the calculations used for ascertaining the number of members must be made before each general election and therefore held that this required the latest statistics of the Commonwealth to be used. The 3 measures introduced by the Government require the Australian Statistician to keep quarterly population figures. They also require him to provide the Chief Australian Electoral Officer with figures relating to the number of people of the Commonwealth and States to enable him to determine the number of members to be chosen for each State. These figures must be provided during the twelfth month of the lifetime of each Parliament. Although the Court found that the method of ascertaining the number of seats was invalid, as the method tied the number of members to the taking of the census, it decided that the 1975 elections could be held on the existing boundaries. Reference has been made to Mr Justice Murphy. I wish to quote Mr Justice Murphy also. In this matter he dissented from the majority opinion. He held that section 24 of the Constitution required the implementation of the principle of one vote one value, as nearly as practicable. Unfortunately, his brother judges did not display such a fervent dedication to this principle. In the most recent decision, handed down earlier this month, in a case in which an elector of New South Wales challenged the validity of certain sections of the electoral Acts, the Court held that the 1964 amendments to the Representation Act which, by the way, were introduced by the then AttorneyGeneral, the present Chief Justice permitting an extra seat to be created where the quota was not exceeded by 50 per cent, were invalid, as they were offensive to the precept of proportionality and the nexus requirements of section 24. Thus we will revert to the pre 1964 position, requiring a remainder of over 50 per cent of quota before an additional seat may be created. While the Court firmly stated its belief that this position one the founding fathers intended may have disastrous effects on the size of all electorates and while the remainder provision is interpreted as requiring greater than 50 per cent of the quota, the 10 per cent weightage will be excessively used and will burden many city electorates with additional constituentssome electorates by up to 8000 and will necessitate a redrawing of all existing boundaries in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia where remainders above the quota do not exceed 50 per cent. While the Opposition is pleased that the Government has recognised the irresponsibility of its opposition to the 10 per cent weightage factor in the 1974 electoral legislation proposed by the Whitlam Government and passed by the Joint Sitting of this Parliament, we cannot accept the proposition in clause 7 of this Bill that limits the number of electors in large electorates to the number in the smallest electorate. This clumsy attempt to protect the National Country Party, whose members are still smouldering over their failure to have the loading increased to 20 per cent, will hinder the distribution commissioners in their attempts to bring electoral justice to Australia. Electoral legislation could make it possible for a party which achieves a majority of votes, as the Australian Labor Party did in 1955, 1961 and 1969, to be denied government through the loading of electorates which operate against the interests of those residents of the capital cities who make up the bulk of the Australian population. Let me make brief reference to an analysis of the last election figures. The Australian Labor Party, with 3 3 13 000 votes, or 42 per cent of the votes, obtained only 36 seats. The Liberal Party with 3 248 000 votes, or 42 per cent of the votes, obtained 68 seats. The National Country Party, with only 853 943 votes, or 1 1 per cent of the votes, obtained 23 seats. It is interesting to note that Labor actually won 64 868 more votes than the Liberal Party in the last election. Such are the iniquitous effects of the electoral provisions that have applied under the provisions of the Electoral Act as determined by the Liberal and Country parties which incorporated that 20 per cent disparity both above and below the electoral quota. The commitment of the Australian Labor Party to democracy cannot be challenged. In this regard all members of this Parliament today probably owe a debt to the Leader of the Opposition. (Mr E. G. Whitlam), who has pursued this matter unrelentingly over the years he has been a member of Parliament. This is an attempt to redress the iniquitous blot on the Australian electoral landscape. We have always sought to have electorates in each State as nearly as practicable equal. Our former colleague, now Mr Justice Murphy, as the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) said just a moment ago, spelt this out during the debate on the 1974 electoral Bill. I want to read it again in the context of the speech I am making because I think it is appropriate to slot it in now. He said:","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

National Country Party members, both in the other place and in this House, have complained about this legislation, despite their commitment to vote for it, claiming that it disadvantages their constituents. These members ignore the first criterion of the commissioners which states that consideration must be given to the community of interests within the division, including economic, social and regional interests. Yet these members tend to place great stress on the second criterion, which relates to the means of communication and travel within the division. No one on this side of the House disparages the idea that some weight and some consideration should be given to such a factor, but it is the extent to which this consideration is harboured and favoured to which we object. By engaging in this to too great an extent they ignore the diverse problems which the high migrant population poses in inner city electorates the problems of housing, transport, education and a host of other problems which do not confront country members to the same degree. The hardship faced by members representing densely populated areas is certainly equal to that caused by travel requirements of country members. Yet no provision is made for additional assistance for these members, as is provided by way of increased electoral allowances and access to charter aircraft for those representing country seats. My colleague the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) has a very high incidence of migrants in his electorate. My colleague, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) is in a similar position. The honourable member for Grayndler represents a Sydney electorate, whereas the honourable member for Wills is from Victoria. As people Hock into these electorates they create enormous social problems, the consequences of inadequacies of governments over the years. It is very often left to the member in these inner city electorates to grapple with all kinds of human problems. I suggest that in the more stable country areas where the graziers have been living for years there is not the same problem. Certainly there are problems. The same consideration is not given to members who represent city people.  Under the new system there will be 47 electorates limited in the number of electors because of their size. Of the 43 New South Wales seats in the new Parliament, 14 will be over 5000 square kilometres in size and the weightage in favour of these seats will vary by up to 14 000 electors, the new quota for New South Wales being 7000 electors. I suppose the National Country Party would still like to see that disparity run into 28 000 rather than 14000. Thus an electorate such as the electorate of Grayndler which is at present 22 square kilometres in size but is densely populated, may increase by up to 20 000 electors while the seat held by the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) can easily remain exactly as it stands at the present time. The second clause which the Opposition is greatly concerned about is clause 10 of the amending Bill. In particular the Opposition is concerned about the proposed subsection (4) to section 25 of the Principal Act which limits the occasions when a proclamation under section 25 (2) may be made, commencing a redistribution because of imbalance between the electors in the division where 25 per cent of electorates are outside the quota. This new provision would prohibit such a redistribution within 7 years of a previous redistribution. If the number of seats for a State alters every 3 years a redistribution will occur and there is no need for an additional redistribution on the grounds of imbalance between the number of electors. However, if the number of seats for a State remains stable, as is more likely, there is no opportunity for a redistribution to correct the imbalance between electorates. In fact there is no guarantee that even when section 25 (2) is satisfied there will be a redistribution as the amendment proposed only prohibits such a redistribution occurring more frequently than every 7 years. The only qualification for this is provided in proposed new subsection (2) (b) ( 1 1 ) which allows the GovernorGeneral to issue a proclamation at such other dmes as he thinks fit, to use the words of the Bill. My view about that is to this effect: In a democratic state the reservation of this power to a GovernorGeneral who has shown that he does not operate on the advice of his Ministers is a reservation of power which this Parliament should not allow. The power to order a redistribution is one which, unless placed firmly in the hands of the Parliament, can quite openly and flagrantly be abused. The Opposition is also greatly concerned about the operation of clause 1 1 which adds a new section to take effect if a redistribution is not undertaken in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act and provides for an election to be held at large. This clause does not provide any machinery under which such an election would be held. The flippancy with which the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers), who is responsible for this legislation, treated queries about this clause in another place and the comments of the AttorneyGeneral (Mr Ellicott) last night, indicate, as is the case with so many other matters of importance, that the Government has not given this matter consideration. Their behaviour indicates that they have no intention of informing the Parliament or the people of Australia how this provision is to operate with regard to such matters as the issuing of writs and the voting procedures. We do not even know, nor does the Chief Australian Electoral Officer have any guidelines to indicate whether we are to have proportional representation, preferential voting or whatever. There is nothing for that matter in respect of ballot papers or many of the other provisions about which guidelines are obviously needed. It is as plain as a pikestaff that if we have to reach that situation where an election at large is held we will see a firstclass shemozzle in this country which will make a mockery of the democratic processes. Therefore I believe that the AttorneyGeneral has a great deal to apply himself to in respect of that suggestion. Finally, the question of timing remains to be discussed. Proposed new section 24 requires the GovernorGeneral to proclaim the new divisions after a redistribution is approved by Parliament, as soon as practicable and whether or not the House of Representatives has expired or been dissolved since that approval was given. If writs were written for an election of the House of Representatives before the GovernorGeneral proclaimed divisions under proposed section 24, the election would have commenced as defined in 1905 by the High Court and it would seem that the new divisions could not be used. If the redistribution had occurred as a result of a change in the number of seats for a State, it would appear that an election at large for the State would be required for an ordinary general election, while in the case of a snap election the old boundaries would be used. Hopefully it will be always the practice that the GovernorGeneral makes the proclamation under proposed section 24 before the writs are issued if a redistribution has been approved by the Parliament prior to this election. The Opposition acknowledges the progress that has been made but it assures the people that electoral justice will only be completely accomplished when the Labor Government takes office after the next federal election.

There are 2 major amendments on which I wish to speak. The first is the provision in the Bill for a distinction between large nonmetropolitan electoral divisions of above 5000 square kilometres and metropolitan divisions under 5000 square kilometres. The provision is that no large division shall have an enrolment at the time of redistribution greater than the enrolment in smaller divisions, those under 5000 square kilometres. It thus ensures adequate representation for people of geographically large divisions. The second provision is the requirement that a redistribution shall be held, firstly, when 25 per cent of divisions have an enrolment exceeding the quota tolerance, of plus or minus 10 per cent, secondly, when the GovernorGeneral sees fit to call a redistribution or, thirdly, if these two do not apply, at intervals of not less than 7 years.  First of all I would like to discuss the area distinction with which the Opposition is so concerned and which it sees as a devious ploy, a gerrymander, in favour of the rural bias. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) used the expression an iniquitous blot. 1 think he might have meant plot. He talked about the percentage of the vote obtained by the 3 major parties and the percentage of seats held in the House as a result of that vote. Time and time again, like so many of his colleagues, he ignores the fact that not all parties contest all seats. If he were to recognise that fact, he could not make the claim he did. This is part of the folklore rhetoric that so often surrounds this argument on the Commonwealth Electoral Act and redistributions. The Opposition has claimed that in the past the 20 per cent tolerance has given a heavy bias towards rural areas. I admit that there is a grave discrepancy between country and city seats at the moment, but this is not the fault of the tolerance. This is brought about largely because of population changes between the States and infrequency of redistributions that have occurred over recent years. For example, the last was some 9 years ago. Let us look at this claim. In the 4 redistributions in 1955, 1962, 1968 and the last one in 197475 in 6 States, therefore giving 24 opportunities for redistribution there were in fact only 3 occasions when the 10 per cent tolerance was exceeded. The metropolitan divisions in Tasmania in 1955 were plus 12 per cent, and in 1962 plus 10.2 per cent. In Western Australia the nonmetropolitan divisions were minus 11.1 per cent in 1 968. 1 would point out that the mean variance in New South Wales over those 4 distributions spanning some 20 years for metropolitan divisions was plus 2.44 per cent and for non metropolitan divisions minus 3.48 per cent, giving a total variance of under 6 per cent between country and city electorates. How does that line up with the wild claims of a 40 per cent variation between country and city electorates? Over 4 distributions over 20 years the total variation in New South Wales, the State with which I am familiar, was less than 6 per cent. If we take individual seats, of course we find extremes. Even so, in New South Wales on only one occasion since 1948 has any division got anywhere near 20 per cent, and that was the division of Darling. In 1968 the variation in that case was minus 18.6 per cent.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

My colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt has an electorate where there is a town of something like 5000 people with no roads whatever to it, many towns and constituents with no telephones whatever, no television that is an absolute luxuryand in many cases no mail services and no air services. In other large electorates there are very good air services. Most roads in Leichhardt are very poor in the dry season and absolutely impassable in the wet season, and that situation does not apply only to the large electorate of Leichhardt. The honourable member for Hughes gave a bleeding heart speech about the grave social problems involved in dealing with inner city suburban electorates. Yet I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) does not even require a car to service his electorate. In fact I understand that he has never even driven one. In some of the electorates which have an area of about Vh miles by 3 miles and some 55 000 to 60 000 people one could service the electorate by jogging around it before breakfast. Another factor to be considered is how many city electorates have a very significant number of State members? How many have the situation which applies in Kalgoorlie, where there are 17 State members? How many have 10, 15 or 20 local government organisations? How many have 5, 10 or 15 newspapers or other media outlets? How many electorates really consist of the rich graziers whom the Labor Party is so keen to denigrate? That myth of the rich grazier! They seem to forget that farmers represent the new poor in this country. My own electorate is 60 per cent urban in provincial towns or cities. When will the Labor Party recognise that the contribution these large electorates make is very significant to the national wealth in terms of both agriculture and mining? How many Labor members would like to spend some time with the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) driving his 50 000 miles per annum? I am sure the honourable member would make an offer to take them around, and they would suddenly realise the amount of time wasted in simply driving around the larger electorates. The honourable member for Burke pointed out that in his opinion the duties of a member were, firstly, to cast a vote on behalf of his constituents and, secondly, to interview constituents personally. He said that he recognised the need for better facilities in terms of allowances and staff for members adequately to service large electorates. But I wonder if that could be done. I wonder how effective the better facilities and allowances would be, and again I quote the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. On 2 May he was reported in the Sunday Telegraph as saying that in the first 4 months of his new parliamentary year he had expended more than half of his electoral allowance. He pointed out that he could drive 2500 kilometres in a straight line in several directions without leaving the electorate. The tolerance principle has been accepted in Australia since Federation, and it has been accepted in many other countries. We should look at New Zealand, where enrolments range from 16 000 to 2 1 000 people, a differential of 35 per cent. We should look at Britain, where in the election following the redistribution in 1974 their constituencies ranged from 22 000 to 96 000 people, a differential of between 400 per cent and 500 per cent. In Canada, a country very similar to Australia geographically, their electorates range from 7500 to 80 000 people. Representation means far more than the right to mark a ballot paper. It means the right to be adequately and fully consulted in discussing problems and in marshalling ideas. It means the right to be able, without undue difficulty, to talk to ones member. It means the right of proper communication with those who sit in Parliament. That right is in a large measure denied to many members who represent large country electorates. It is a right for which country people need to be protected to a degree, but only to a limited degree, under the existing law. Members of the National Country Party would be failing in their duty if they did not fight with all their power to protect the limited rights of country people and to secure for country people something approaching the equality of representation to which they are entitled as Australian citizens. Let us look at the sacred academic argument of one vote, one value. This, of course, is an impossible ideal to achieve, and I challenge members on the Opposition benches to name one country where it has been achieved in terms of their euphemistically named ideal of electoral justice.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

How can one accept one vote, one value as a philosophy when one looks at the quotas on the enrolments based on the December 1976 figures. The quota for South Australia is 71 850, for Tasmania 52 000, for the Northern Territory 40 000. How ridiculous it is to talk about electoral justice. Secondly, the Constitution provides for an original State to have a certain number of members and thereby the Constitution denies electoral justice. Senate representation varies from 300 000 people in New South Wales, 59 000 people in the Aus.tralian Capital Territory, 50 000 people in Tasmania, and 20 000 people in the Northern Territory. Equality of representation is a fine ideal but it is not attainable in such a huge, dispersed, sparsely populated country as this.  The anomaly of territorial representation is something which I think needs to be brought up. The population in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory is not to be counted when determining the size of the House of Representatives, and I think there is merit in the argument put by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen). If the territorial population is eligible to vote, to pay taxes, and we presume soon to vote at referenda, surely it is consistent that it be included in determining the size of the House of Representatives. How strange is it that the size of the House of Representatives will soon be reduced to 123 members, only 2 more than it had 30 years ago, in spite of the enormous increase in population during that time. Concern has been expressed by the Opposition that by having an area differentiation country divisions will be tied to the fastest growing city divisions, but I point out that that is not mathematically possible. It is not mathematically possible to have a fast growing city seat held at minus 7 per cent or minus 8 per cent or even minus 9 per cent, as has been suggested, and still provide in New South Wales, for example, for the enrolments required in the remaining 14 divisions over 5000 kilometres. Let us be factual in our discussions. Let us see through all the rhetoric that is associated with so much of the ballyhoo about electoral representation. In practice, the real variances are more likely to be what they were in the past and, as far as metropolitan seats are concerned, that was up to plus 3 per cent and for nonmetropolitan seats down to minus 4 per cent, a total of 6 per cent to 8 per cent. They could, of course, be the same. I believe it is totally justifiable that larger non metropolitan seats are not greater in enrolment than city seats. What a ridiculous situation it was with the Labor redistribution in 197475 that the largest division in Victoria, the division of Mallee, had the largest enrolment in that State. What about the proposed division of Flynn in Queensland, where there was one division extending from Camooweal or Mt Isa down to Birdsville and across to the outskirts of Toowoomba, stretching 1700 kilometres in a straight line. Not all of that is spinifex, sandhills or camels. Most of it consists of many settlements, some big, some small, and an area like that is quite impossible to serve. Finally, the second proposition that has caused concern is that a redistribution shall not be held more frequently than every 7 years, if the other 2 provision do not apply. The leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) expressed some concern about that. I ask him: Does he not recognise that there is a completely different ball game? One quarter of the divisions have to be out of kilter by 10 per cent and immediately a redistribution has to be called for that State. The GovernorGeneral the Oppositions friendcan call a redistribution as be sees fit. I believe that that is a perfectly reasonable proposition, and so is the provision to ensure that disabilities encountered by country people in obtaining a reasonable degree of representation are minimised.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have heard ad nauseam in the 2 1 years I have been a member of this place the case made out by the Country Party against proper democratic political representation. One sees it in turning back the pages of political history. The honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) has a rather simplistic view of representation. It is whether a person has a car or not. It is whether a person lives in his electorate or not. Perhaps it is a reasonable proposition. To reply to the honourable member, what I have to say is that he does not live anywhere. He just takes up space. My own view of representation is that it does not matter where one sleeps. It is what one does when one is awake that matters. It is time that the Country Party woke up to the fact that we are dealing with people. The honourable member for Calare and I suppose it is a tribute to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter) in his propaganda campaign is capitalising on the reflected glory of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie who represents or misrepresents most of Western Australia.

He may as well make the most of them. Members of the Country Party say it is hard luck that  Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MrLucock)Order! Firstly, I remind the House of the comment I made in regard to honourable members addressing their remarks to the Chair. Secondly, I remind honourable members that interjections are out of order. While there has been some comment with regard to the Bill that people will not be here much longer, if interjections continue that statement will be a correct one at least for tonight. You will have to forgive me Mr Deputy Speaker. I was speaking eloquently about the Country Party and knowing you are a member of it I thought you would be embarrassed if I directed my remarks straight at you. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has 17 State members to look after. Apparently that is a hardship. Obviously they are mostly Country Party members. I would have thought that that was fairly adequate representation. The Opposition has 2 serious objections to this Bill. This Bill is again another mangling of the many efforts to try to make Australian political representation democratic. We object to the guidelines that have been set down for the periods of redistributions and we object to the possibility rather more than the probability, perhaps in the immediate future of a gerrymander arising out of the area provisions. There would have to be something wrong with us if we did not realise that in the long history of electoral redistributions they have gradually become worse and worse in this country wherever conservative parties have been in command. Another point I would like to make about the honourable member for Calare is that he said there is no possibility of direct electoral justice under the present Constitution. Therefore he says if we cannot have direct electoral justice we may as well magnify the injustice. We recognise the fact that we are cornered inside the Constitution and can only, as near as practicable, make redistributions democratic inside each State. The honourable member mentioned that there have been 4 distributions over a period of 20 years in which the differential between the various electorates was fairly small. I think that is the way it ought to be, as I hope to explain in a few moments. My own view is that electorates ought to be as close as practicable in voting power because that is what representative government is about. I represent 113 000 people in the electorate of Wills. The honourable member for Clare represents 85 000 people in his electorate. We are about the business, not of geography, but of people. So I want to raise the general question of the potential trickery that is behind this Bill. The honourable member for Calare made great play on some of the recent history of the Bill. The facts are of course that since federation there was until about 1960 a very consistent philosophy behind electoral redistributions and mostly they stuck pretty close to the quotas not completely, but in the redistributions over that period they kept pretty close to the quotas. When I became a member of this Parliament it was accepted by both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party that the 10 per cent differential was adequate. In most cases, as was pointed out by the honourable member, we did not go even as far as that. However there was a hard fought campaign by the Country Party over a period of years to have the differential increased to 20 per cent and it succeeded during a period when it had a tighter grip on the Liberal Party than it now has. All I can say in favour of the Liberal Party after watching it for 2 1 years is that it is nice to know that at one period now it has stuck to the principle and it has not given in to the area syndrome of the honourable members from the Country Party. What is it all about? The objective is representative government. What is representative government? First of all, I believe it is equality of representation. It has nothing much to do with quality as such. The citizens of Australia pick a number of us for many different reasons but when we sit in this House we each vote as one. It is one vote, one value and we are counted for ourselves and ourselves alone. Any system which interferes with the capacity of each one of us to represent a certain number of people has a great potential to be undemocratic. I am not taken in by the reference to Great Britain, the United States of America, Canada or anywhere else. We do not have to model ourselves upon them. It is not so distant in the past that Australia was regarded as one of the first democracies in the world and it is time that we got back to that general program. The objective is equality of access to political decision making and that can only be based upon simple arithmetic.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Actually I live wherever my work takes me. I even pass through the honourable members electorate and I find that the people there wish they had the same kind of representation as have the people of Wills. The objective is equality of access to political decision making, equality of voice in this House. The only way to get that is to have equal voting strength in the electorates. There is a philosophy which supports a policy that there ought to be equal populations in electorates. That would be satisfactory from a point of view of people like me but I would regard it as potentially undemocratic. Therefore we have to accept the point that redistributions of electorates should be based upon the voting power of people and the voting power of their representatives in this House. I cannot understand how the people of Australia stand the trickery that has gone into the electoral systems in Australia. It has mostly been done by our opponents but not absolutely. Occasionally Labor Party governments have done the same. One has only to think of the sad history of electoral reform. Think of the House of Commons and the long battle to get decent elections for that place. The first fight was about getting manhood suffrage. I thought that as we were dealing with the Country Party and the system it likes to foster in political elections it might be worth while reminding its members that they are not the first people in history to indulge in trickery. I have here a book called The Addled Parliament of 1614 about contemporary with their philosophy. An election was being held. Sir HenryRich, a favourite of the King, was defeated in Norfolk. Rich entered the contest confidently, supported by letters from the Lord Chamberlain, Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk. The sheriffs county court opened at the castle in Norwich, the customary place, on 7 March at about seven oclock in the morning with about three thousand freeholders assembled for the election, most of them supporters of Rich. But within half an hour, after some routine business had been dispatched, the sheriffs deputy suddenly adjourned the court to Swaffham, twenty miles away. The high sheriff, who was already at Swaffham, proceeded to hold the election there in the presence of a few freeholders assembled for the purpose. The National Country Party cannot do that now. What it does is to try to change the electoral boundaries to make up for being deprived of that opportunity. It has been a long haul through manhood suffrage, abolition of plural voting, removal of the property franchise, fixing up other qualifications, giving votes to the Aboriginal people of Australia, votes for women and recently votes for people over 18 years of age. In every instance in which we have attempted to bring more complete democracy to this Parliament and to the parliaments of Australia, we have been faced with the hot tempered opposition of honourable members on the other side of the House, particularly members of the Country Party. When we come to the question of electoral boundaries, I believe that a proper democracy means that the electorates must be as equal as possible in voting strength and there is no practical difficulty whatsoever in doing that. The census system in Australia is adequate enough. The counting is complete and the enrolment recording is absolute enough for that to be done, I should think, to within 1000 or so in the average electorate. I will be happier with the Electoral Act when it provides that electorates shall be as nearly as practicable equal in voting strength at the time when the electoral boundaries are drawn. Perhaps the extension of the 12 months provision for the new census figures to be issued should be complimented by a provision that the boundaries shall be redrawn 12 months before every election is due. It is time the Parliament established the principle of equality of electorates, the principle of one vote one value. Will the honourable member for Calare care to debate the issue around the country with any member on this side of the House.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/para[8]","N/A","N/A"

I suggest, therefore, that those honourable members on my right cease interjecting.  I shall continue the comparison. Wills is a very productive part of Australia. My friends from the National Country Party who represent some of the World s most efficient primary producers I think that is one of the facts of Australian life will understand the comparable and complementary productivity of factories and people in areas such as I represent. It has an almost unbelievable concentration of manufacturing capacity. There are hundreds of factories, some of them very large and some of them quite small, but there is an almost unbelievable concentration of productive capacity and wealth inside those ten or eleven square miles. I represent that in the context of the present economic situation with regard to tariffs and such like. These industries are as difficult to represent as the open spaces of country electorates. The great concentration means a greater concentration required by the member and people such as myself to locate the problems and keep in touch with them. While I recognise the difficulties of travel and transport of members of the National Country Party, I think it is time that they recognised that the representative principle also covers the difficulties and problems of such people as I represent. I do not concede to any honourable member that my task is not just as difficult or just as demanding. I work at it as much as I am physically capable. I give it the spirit that I think the people request and I know that other honourable members in this place I know a lot of them very well indeed, people with whom I have travelled on committees and so on are doing the same. I may well believe that many of them are in grievous political error, but I think that the people of Australia on the whole are pretty well served by the devotion and dedication of people who come into this place. We do not gain anything for the Parliament by suggesting otherwise, or by suggesting that we should have some principle which departs from the democratic principle. What is the logic of the area principle that is, say, 120 seats for an area of 3 million square miles? The extreme logic of it, nonsensically of course, would simply be to divide Australia into one hundred and twenty 25 000 square mile equal portions, regardless of the population. Even my friend, the honourable member for Calare, would say that that is not reasonable. There is no possible way to equate space and people. My friends opposite talk about the great difficulties of it. They cite all sorts of difficulties but we live in a world of communicationtelephones, travel, television and all the rest of it and we are now in communication in a way which was not possible when the electorates were first drawn. I hope that the Parliament will reject the propositions contained in this Bill and that honourable members on the other side of the House who stood up, but not quite firmly enough, for a principle, will at last relent in thendeparture from the principle of one vote one value and proper and equal representation and reject the domination of the Country Party.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/para[14]","N/A","N/A"

I can remember that the debates which took place in 1975 were somewhat more heated than the debate which we have had in this House today. It is proposed that we go into Committee on this legislation, but there are a number of matters with which I want to deal before we do that so that I can answer some of the questions raised by honourable members.  Honourable members opposite have asked the question: Why do we need the legislation? Obviously it is unthinkable that in a democracy we should not put into our legislation the basic steps by which the democratic process will come into operation. In the Commonwealth Electoral Act we provide for redistribution. In the Representation Act we provide for the determination of numbers. In the Census and Statistics Act we provide for the counting of the people of the Commonwealth. Those are all matters that have to be dealt with by legislation. Although in a sense one could have a redistribution on an executive basis, at the same time obviously it is highly desirable that our people know what the Distribution Commissioners are about. What they are about, of course, is implementing the provisions that this Parliament will lay down in this legislation. The Representation Act, the Census and Statistics Act and the Act that we are debating are a trilogy which will implement the decision of the High Court. That decision has made it quite clear that there is a need to amend the existing relevant legislation in order to bring it into accord with the Constitution as it was interpreted in the 2 High Court decisions. For instance, although the High Court said that it was enough just to rely on section 24 of the Constitution, there is a need to do something about section 10 of the Representation Act and the amending legislation in fact does that. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) seemed to get some glee from the fact that perhaps the Chief Justice had approved the legislation of 1964. I only wish that the Leader of the Opposition had looked at the Act of 1964. Had he done so he would have found that it was introduced on 15 October 1964. He will find also that the Chief Justice left this place on about 27 April 1 964. So I guess, as usual, the barb was in his tongue because of things that he can never forget. Much of the debate has turned on the amendment to section 19 and the amendment to section 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. For instance, section 19 deals with the principle in relation to 5000 square kilometres and the other section deals with redistribution being forbidden, in effect, because of the quota coming out of balance within a period of 7 years. The attack in this regard has been based on the principle of one vote one value. Obviously that is not a principle which is practicable in any sense whatsoever. I want to demonstrate as quickly as I can, first of all, that you cannot apply the principle, that the Constitution does not require it, and that the Labor Party has never adhered to it. When you add those 3 things together, I am not sure what you get I will not call it humbug or hypocrisy but let us just put the principle of one vote one value in its place, because to try to espouse it in a logical way just is not possible. For instance, the Constitution itself belies the principle of one vote one value. Section 24 of the Constitution provides a method of dividing States in proportion to the respective populations and it allows the quota system. If after the appropriate division is made there remains greater than one half of the quota, one more member can be chosen in that State. Quite clearly, if the remaining number is less than one half of the quota in other words, if it amounts to only 49 per cent the State concerned does not get another member. If the remaining number represents5 1 per cent of the quota, the State concerned does get another member. It does not take a great mathematician to work out that that system immediately takes one away from the one vote one value principle. Then again, section 29 of the Act, which deals with representation and the subdivision of boundaries and so on for the States, allows allegiance and reference to State law. If the founding fathers had intended that one vote one value be written into the Constitution, they would hardly have left it in that form. Of course, the Commonwealth Parliament did not legislate for a certain period, and the State laws applied. The reference in section 24 of the Constitution is to the people of the Commonwealth, not the electors of the Commonwealth. The High Court has recently reendorsed that. The term the people of the Commonwealth means all the people of the Commonwealth and not just those chosen to be electors. It says that the House of Representatives shall be composed of members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth. Of course, that does not mean that it is chosen by people of unsound mind or by babes in arms. It is a political expression but, at the same time, when you come to the numbers and the nexus in section 24, you find that the term the people of the Commonwealth does include all those people, because honourable members in this chamber do represent all the people in a very real sense. Those who are given the privilege of voting do so on their own behalf and on behalf of the people in the electorate. Therefore in that sense the Constitution does not espouse the principle of one vote one value. We know that each of the original States was to have at least 5 members of Parliament and we know that Tasmania divides up in a certain way. So again you cannot have one vote one value; it just is not possible. It is not written into the Consitution. Of course, there are certain other practical effects. The senators are chosen by the people but there is an equal number of senators in each State. I do not have to take honourable members through the figures, but it can be seen that again you do not get one vote one value.

405,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ELLICOTT, Bob","YF6","N/A","N/A","N/A",484,"In addition, we have the 1975 redistribution, which reveals its own facts. In that redistribution one finds some very interesting figures. The Leader of the Opposition has spoken in this debate and has espoused the principle again of one vote, one value. But listen to this: In the 1975 redistribution that was brought forward in this Parliament the electorate of Gwydir had 67 560 people and Werriwa 59 070 people a difference of 12 per cent. Is this an indication of one vote, one value? Ralph Hunt, with one of the largest electorates in his State, had 67 560 people; the then Prime Minister had 59 070 people in his electorate. Where is the principle of one vote, one value in that?  I am only saying this because I believe a lot of nonsense is spoken and espoused around the principle of one vote, one value. I am not suggesting that a principle is not involved in this, but lt is a very broad principle, for the simple reason that it is just not practicable to achieve the principle of one vote, one value. Honourable members opposite go on discussing it and talking about it, but all the time they are not able to aim for it. Perhaps it could be achieved in a fixed agrarian society, but it just cannot be achieved in the society we have in 1 977. Quite obviously, in providing for a redistribution there must be a time lag between the time the numbers of the people are counted and the time they are divided up. We all know that it takes something like 12 months to have a redistribution and if one is to be held in a 3year period it has to commence no later than the end of the first year. Of course, that is what these amendments seek to provide for in a practical way. Nothing is dictated by the Constitution in relation to this but, at the same time, by the time an election is held after a redistribution it may well be found that the precise numbers upon which electorates have been divided up have changed because of population changes. I think it is fair to say that the Labor Party members have tended to adopt a rotten borough approach to this, particularly in their attacks in this Parliament. All I want to say about that is this: If they go to the figures for the redistribution of federal electorates they will find a fairly good record. They can go back through the figures. They have been quoted already and I do not want to quote them again. But they do show a reasonable adherence to the 10 per cent principle. It is only in more recent years, with a more volatile moving population, that the distribution gets out of kilter more quickly. We need to get away from this rotten borough idea in terms of the Commonwealth redistribution. The redistribution system has been reasonably fair. Even when one takes the figures in relation to the totality of numbers and votes they tend to reflect that the party that has the greatest number of votes usually is in power. What are important in all this are the criteria that are laid down in section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This Bill the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill purports to introduce another criterion in relation to large divisions and small divisions. Quite clearly, it is fair enough to take into account the size of electorates. If I might suggest, it is fair enough to require that the electorate of Gwydir, for instance, which covers more than 5000 square kilometres, should not have more electors to service than Werriwa. Of course, that is what clause 7 of this Bill would achieve. I have given the figures for those 2 electorates under the Labor Partys attempted redistribution in 1975. This clause is intended to deal with that situation. It is an eminently fair clause. The honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) said that the role of a member of Parliament was to come here and to talk, but also to speak to his electors. I suggest to honourable members that it is fair enough that factors such as this should be taken into account in determining the numbers in and size of electorates. That is what the amendment to section 1 9 is aimed at doing. Something was said about the 7year period provision that this Bill seeks to include in section 25 of the Act. We are all familiar with the arguments concerning this. But just to make it clear, despite the fact that the Executive can call for an earner redistribution if it wishes, the amendment is aimed to give stability and to make sure that people grow accustomed to their member and get to know him; that they are not confused by change at every election. This is highly desirable. We have had suggestions from honourable members that in the country there is a much more personal relationship between members and their constituents. But constituents in city electorates get to know their members also. It is a good idea for that situation not to be disturbed too often. Therefore, this is not an attempt to entrench provisions or politicians, or to require that a distribution take place no earlier than within 7 years. It is a method of ensuring adequate, proper and reasonable electoral representation. Of course, if the Executive sees some problem or if some event occurs that requires redistribution, it can have one at an earlier stage. The other provision that has been referred to is the addition of sections 25a to the Act, which relates to elections at large. Senator Withers, the Minister for Administrative Services in the other place, indicated that he was concerned about this matter and thought that the Electoral Act ought to contain specific provisions in order to deal with elections at large. He indicated to the Senate that he was working on this matter. After all, the latest decision in the High Court was given only a fortnight ago. In due course the Minister will bring forward measures to govern the provisions of proposed new section 25a, relating to elections at large. That is to deal with the unlikely event of such an election occurring. If it does occur in the meantime, it would seem that under the Constitution such an election would have to be held in a way which added up to the description members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, as contained in section 24 of the Act. No doubt that election, which could be subject to State laws which might to some extent be applicable, would be prescribed by the Executive. But this would not be desirable in this area. One can readily conceive of the method being otherwise than is provided for in legislation. Section 25a, one hopes, will be supplemented in the near future by provisions which will govern an election at large. Of course, the thought of an election at large is not something which fills any of us with any joy. It is a remote possibility that one would be held, but it is something that the Minister for Administrative Services has well in mind. One hopes that it will be dealt with in the near future.

In some instances the so called large electorates have a smaller effective area than some of the extremely small electorates where travel is difficult. On a Sunday afternoon I would prefer to travel 90 miles in the Wimmera electorate than 30 miles in the La Trobe electorate; I am certain I would do it more quickly. Distance itself is not a criterion.  I suggest that the proposal being put before the Committee by the Government would be honest if the figure were 20 000 to 50 000 square kilometres. That could be defended as a large electorate. This proposal places on the distribution commissioners an impossible condition. In New South Wales there are 14 seats which are deemed to be in the large electorate category. In Victoria there are 9. There is an equal number of seats in those States which would be looked at as rapid growth seats and which, at the time of a redistribution, would normally be below a quota. I refute what the AttorneyGeneral (Mr Ellicott) said. He made much play about equal distribution but the proposals put by the Opposition have always been 10 per cent above and below. At least in theory the Government has indicated its support for that practice. A 7year period is spelt out later in the legislation. Requirements are now being proposed to be put into section 19 of the Act. There are 14 seats in New South Wales and 10 in Victoria at the moment, but I think it would be 9, which must carry fewer electors than any other seat. The Minister suggested by inference that some special treatment had been given to the Werriwa electorate. I do not cast that aspersion on distribution commissioners. I believe that they allocated quotas on the criteria which were in the Act. One of the expectancies of redistribution is that growth electorates would grow above a quota during the period in which the set boundaries were current and that electorates which would decline in population would fall below a quota. That sort of criterion has always been used. Only the extremely large electorates have usually been treated differently. If the Minister wants to talk about electorates being treated unfairly in a redistribution, I suggest that he look at the redistribution of 1968 and what was done in the Macquarie electorate. It was about twice the size of the Richmond electorate. It was given about 6000 voters over a quota at that stage, while adjoining Country Party and Liberal Party electorates were given a number below a quota. The Macquarie electorate has in that period grown to the order of 80 000 voters82 000 voters at the last count whereas Richmond, with substantially fewer electors at the time of the last redistribution, was given a number well below a quota for the State. Richmond is half the size of the Macquarie electorate. It has 63 000 electors. I suggest that the previous member for Macquarie, Mr Luchetti, was apparently not only able to look after a larger electorate but also was expected to be able to look after a larger enrolment in a larger electorate than were the Country Party members who represented electorates which bordered his seat in all directions. The 5000 square kilometre proposal is nothing better than a compromise. It is an extraordinarily poor compromise. I believe that if the Government were genuinely seeking to look after the interests of members with difficulties in large seats I say large seats, not what are deemed in this Act to be large it would be looking at 20 000 or 50 000 square kilometres because they are the sorts of electorates which would have difficulties. It is no good for the Government to talk about the problems of the member for Riverina when it is inserting a provision in an Act which deals with electorates which are 60 miles long by 40 miles wide 100 kilometres by 60 kilometres. That is not a very big electorate in this day and age. I do not think it would have been considered big even in 1900. 1 suggest that members of the Liberal Party who have accepted this proposition have fallen for the 3card trick. They would have been better off accepting the original proposition which at least would have given them a chance of getting a fair distribution.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not believe the Electoral Act should be amended to give false protection to large electorates when those electorates are not large geographically or in respect of communication or any other circumstance.  I think the Government would have done itself and the distribution commissioners a service if it had put in the Act a provision that the commissioners should take into account the geographic size of electorates and the geographic difficulties of electorates. Electorates do not have to be big to have geographic difficulties. The Government has preferred to write in this provision which will ensure that within a very short period after the redistribution there will be a complete distortion of electorate sizes in each of the major States. The position may be even worse in the smaller States. The flexibility is taken away from the commissioners. It is not unlike the propositions that have been undertaken in some of the States where the commissioners have been given zones and quotas, and the only effective action which they have been able to take has been to draw the lines.

415,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HYDE, John","9W4","Moore","N/A","N/A",488,"I think it might be of interest to the Committee to look at the history of this clause. The Act was first enacted in 1902. There was a very minor amendment to the clause in 1905 which merely ensured that State electoral boundaries were considered in redistributions. The clause remained unaltered until 1972, when 4 amendments were made to it. Three might have been thought to favour rural areas and one might have been thought to favour city areas. The clause was again amended in 1 974. In 1 974 the Labor Government removed three of the 1972 amendments and retained the one amendment that favoured city areas. We are now returning to the same clause as served this Parliament and the people of Australia from 1902 to 1972, apart from the minor amendment in 1905.I am not one who believes that we ought to give heavy weightings to widespread areas. I believe that as far as is practicable each individual citizen in this country ought to have the same opportunity to influence the course of government in this country.  I represent an electorate that covers both rural areas and city areas. It is the eleventh biggest electorate in the Parliament. Probably as a result I have as much experience as anyone of both areas. I can say with certainty that rural areas are the easier to represent. This is because there is a community of interest in rural areas small shires, small towns, small newspapers and so on. People in rural areas are also much better informed than their city counterparts. They know more about the process of government. They are more likely to know who their member is and so on. However, there is another side to this story. The democratic process also requires that the Parliament of the people represent the views of the people. It is a fact a fact beyond disputethat most Australian citizens believe that it is proper that these disparate areas have some additional assistance from their member. This is not an argument that personally impresses me a great deal. However we are reflecting the will of the people when we ensure that no large electoratethat is, one that is more than 5000 square kilometres in sizeshould have fewer people in it than an electorate that is of less than 5000 square kilometres. This legislation is a reflection of what most people in Australia would wish us to do. Can we argue that that is undemocratic? Obviously we cannot. I am confident that this clause will receive passage as it stands. There has been a considerable attempt by Labor Party speakers in particular to drive a wedge between the coalition parties. All I can say is that they would have to do a great deal better than they have done so far if they are to achieve that. The truth of the matter is that the Government Parties are agreed on this clause. There is no measure of appreciable disagreement between us. The nature of the Act is such that the variation from quota will only ever be small. This arrangement is acceptable to both Parties and they support the Government, I believe, without exception.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
416,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BOWEN, Lionel","ZE4","Kingsford Smith","ALP","Smith",488,"The whole point of clause 7 is whether it is necessary at all. That is the point the Opposition is making. The Opposition has no objection to a fair distribution within the 10 per cent tolerance. We are prepared to rely on the Distribution Commissioners to act in accordance with the tenor of the Act. But to write into the legislation the additional provision that they themselves are bound by something this Parliament determines, namely area, can well affect the justice of the situation. The Constitution, particularly as now emphasised by the High Court decision, virtually made, despite what other people have said here, a one vote one value proposition in that the population of the Commonwealththat is, a count of the heads of people is to be the yardstick upon which we determine the quota for the States. It was not intended that we dividethe120membersintopopulationplus area. The Constitution meant us to divide the 120 into population. The quota is fixed on people. Accordingly one can really argue from the point of view of electoral justice that as the principle of one vote one value applied in the High Court determination of fixing the quota for States, would not the logical situation be that within the State itself, as far as is practicable, we should as near as possible have equal quotas?  What has been said by my colleague, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), is the mathematical result of this sort of interlineation as to what should happen when we come to the mathematics of the matter. The clause says that where the size of an electorate is more than S600 square kilometres we cannot put any more people in the lowest quota in the State. That could well be fair. But let us look at the mathematics of the situation. This clause will allow us to discard all the other factors of population and we will deal with electors. The Distribution Commissioner could then say: Oh well, I would think really that this area could take more people but because of the area requirements I cannot now do that. I am bound by the Parliament. Why does the Government distrust Distribution Commissioners? The Government knows that onethird of electorates are below the normal quota. The other twothirds of the electorates will have to take up that balance. That is where the mathematics get out of kilter. What the Government is putting forward is not really a fair proposition. I refer particularly to electorates which have growth potential. The Gold Coast area is the fastest growing area in Australia. It would be appropriate to weigh that area on the basis that we would give it a low quota and its growth will be such that in a short space of time it would be over quota. But once we do that, we have to give every other seat in Queensland with no growth potential a low quota. The population in some country districts might be declining because of difficulties in rural production. Therefore this clause will have the effect of throwing the system right out of kilter. Another clause in this Bui which we will be discussing later will have the effect of net allowing anything to be done for over 7 years in the case of electorates that have been thrown out of kilter. Only the GovernorGeneral will be able to decide whether this can be done, and he is not likely to make any individual decision. So there can be a lack of electoral justice.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

What we are saying is this: Why not leave it to the Distribution Commissioner to determine this matter in accordance with the tolerance of 10 per cent and disregard the area consideration?  I emphasise the point that the Constitution was founded on the basis of population. It was not said that area could be taken into consideration. With the State boundaries as they are we have a disparity of distance, people and areas. For example, some areas may decline and others may grow. We can see that the Constitution says that that consideration does not matter, that we must work on a population basis. Why should the Government put so much emphasis on the area factor when there are so many electorates which are of a relatively low size of 5600 square kilometres? Onethird of the electorates are of this size and the balance of the weight is to go against the other twothirds. In the short space of two or three years many of the electorates which make up the two thirds of the total will be out of kilter. They will be well over the 10 per cent variation and nothing can be done. That is the argument against this clause. It does not matter what another provision in the Bill says.

Distributions in the State will not be every 7 years. The High Court decision has clearly said that, wherever necessary means within every 3 years. Wherever necessary, the Distribution Commissioner has to fix quotas or each State within every 3 year period. Why should the distribution on balance not be left undisturbed? While State quotas may be fixed every 3 years, it will not be possible readily to change the internal distribution. That is the weakness in this clause. Accordingly, it is not much good shaking your head and saying: It cannot happen. It will.  The position in Australia is continually changing. The electorate which takes in the Gold Coast wm be well over quota within 3 years, and nothing will be done about it. Electorates in the city of Sydney will be well over quota and getting more enrolments all the time because that is where the migrants and others live. This is the incredible part of the Governments argument. State quotas are fixed on population and all city electorates have enormous populations but for Federal distributions population is ignored. It is said: That is just too baa. You will have to look at the internal arrangements we are going to make, and we are going to make them according to area . By all means give the Distribution Commissioners a discretion. But why oblige them to follow this line now as though it will be fair for all time? The High Court said that the quotas for States are not fair for all time, that distributions have to be carried out wherever possible and as soon as practicable, certainly every 3 years. The Chief Justice said: If you do not do it the High Court will do it for you. That is the reasonable aspect of electoral justice. The concept of the Constitution was that people really counted, and that is what we should adhere to. But by inserting this clause the Government is deviating from that concept. It is creating an injustice. Why does it not trust the Distribution Commissioners. If it is possible to operate within the 10 per cent tolerance, why tie the Commissioners to the provisions of this clause?","N/A","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer particularly to the Australian Labor Party and its approach to electoral redistribution. We hear a lot of discussion about the problems of large electorates or small electorates. In the United Kingdom, for example, the larger and smaller electorates are more evenly distributed between the parties. Therefore there is not the amount of haggling that goes on in this Parliament with regard to redistribution.  I heard the honourable member for KingsfordSmith (Mr Lionel Bowen) say that we do not trust our Distribution Commissioners. I trust them up to 20 per cent tolerance. I would not restrict them to 10 per cent tolerance. I would rely on their good judgment, taking into consideration all the factors available for them to consider. I would be much more impartial than those speakers who perhaps want to help themselves or their party. There are a lot of angles to this situation. I refer to electorates getting out of kilter under the 20 per cent tolerance. In my State, Queensland, the last distribution was in 1968. Let me mention the average enrolment for the 9 electorates of Capricornia, Darling Downs, Dawson, Fisher, Kennedy, Leichhardt, Maranoa, Wide Bay and Herbert. They are the nonmetropolitan seats, with the exception of McPherson. The figures would have been a lot better with McPherson included, but I have left it out. The average enrolment of these 9 electorates today is 60 450. It is not far from the permissible average of 64 000, which it is suggested will be the average in Queensland if 19 seats are allocated. In the other 9 seats in Queensland, including McPherson, which is the one which has grown out of all proportion, the average is some 76 000. The tolerance of 10 per cent will mean a variation from 57 000 to 70 000. 1 would like a 20 per cent tolerance and an allowance for all the disabilities of large electorates. I emphasise that there are disabilities in representing large electorates. I refer to no less an expert than the AttorneyGeneral (Mr Ellicott), who said:","N/A","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They are not the words of people who are supposed to be benefiting by putting up a case for the problems associated with the representation of large electorates. I hope that the people listening to this debate consider the fact that a lot of the debate too much of it has centred on what might affect a political party to advantage or otherwise. I hope we can get away from that. The way to get away from it is to give the Distribution Commissioners the opportunity to use those considerations. The fact is, and it has been acknowledged in many other countries, that there is a difference between electorates. Someone spoke about everyone having an equal opportunity to influence the Government. To have an equal opportunity to influence the Government you also want an equal opportunity to discuss with your member the problems of government. That is what the people in the large outlying electorates do not get. The fact that a member gets more funds or travel facilities simply reduces the cost to the member servicing a large electorate. It does not save him the great amount of time he spends travelling. When travelling by air in my electorate I fly over a large number of settlements on my way to larger centres. I like to give all the people an opportunity of seeing their member, so I travel a lot by car to the smaller centres. So let us not run away with the idea that simply getting travelling facilities enables a member to represent his electorate as well as a member in an electorate where people have an opportunity to go and see him or where, as one of my colleagues said, members do not even have to drive a car. However, that is their business and I have no doubt that their electorates are as well represented as any other because of the small distances.  Let me look for a moment again I take my own State of Queensland at the type of redistribution that was proposed to this Parliament by the Labor Government and rightly rejected by this Parliament.

The reason they do not worry about the people outside the metropolitan areas is that so many of their members are elected in the metropolitan areas.

I heard some talk about mathematicians, but I do not think that some Labor members are as good mathematicians as they think they are.

We never hear a Country Party member in this place talking about the problems of rural health, about which the Hospitals and Health Services Commission established by the Labor Government brings down reports. We never hear them talk about those sorts of issues. The Parliament exists to serve people, and if one looks at the Constitution, it provides that this House, the House of Representatives, is to represent people, not simply electors. There are a great many people resident in Australia who, because they do not come from countries which confer British nationality or Irish citizenship, have not had the opportunity to register to vote in this country as soon as they might. I represent one of those divisions, and the vast bulk of my constituency work is concerned with representing the very great needs of persons who have come from overseas to make new lives in this country for themselves and their children.

It seeks to override the very fair provisions of the existing section 19 of the Electoral Act. Section 19 of the Electoral Act lays down very fair considerations to which the Distribution Commissioners have regard when they draw up new electoral divisions. It talks about community of interests, including economic, social and regional interests. It talks about means of communication. It does not talk about means of communication as meaning that people are to be compensated because the distances they travel are much greater. That is a job for the Remuneration Tribunal, and as every member on this side of the House has made clear, we support in every way giving every piece of extra assistance that is necessary to assist those people who represent physically large electorates.

In that respect I have an advantage over the honourable member for La Trobe from whom I have never heard an interjection nor a single substantive speech in which he has exhibited the slightest understanding of the matter about which he is speaking. His own colleagues realise that and realise what a clown he is. Proposed new section 19 concerns matters to be considered in a distribution in a State. The factors that I think the distribution commissioners ought to have regard to are the needs of people and not the needs of inanimate objects which Country Party supporters and their stooges in the Liberal Party, like the honourable member for La Trobe, talk about.  I never thought I would come into this Parliament to talk about ears of barley corn or dead cows. I came to talk about the needs of human beings not all of whom, as I stressed, are yet citizens of this country, but many of whom want to become citizens and want their children to become citizens. Those children are educated under the migrant education programs programs which honourable members opposite know nothing about and programs which they oppose at every turn. That is why this proposed new section 19 (2) that the Government seeks to insert into the Act is a most disgraceful section. It will in many ways, I believe, operate to the detriment of urban areas much more than the preexisting 20 per cent tolerance did. One. of the things the distribution commissioners have to have regard to is the trends in population. No honest Distribution Commissioner will be able to disregard the fact that the outer metropolitan seats in metropolitan areas expand in population very quickly between redistributions. They will therefore have to exercise a tolerance of 10 per cent below the quota for outer metropolitan seats. That means that the inner metropolitan seats, which will have to be larger because all country seats have to be smaller than outer metropolitan seats, will then have the tolerance exercised against them. So it will be the quota plus. This means that an already disgraceful position in which people are underrepresented in the Parliament people who have not yet had the chance to become citizens will be exacerbated and their position will be that much worse. This will not operate in the electorate of Wentworth. The electorate of Wentworth has fewer people than the electorate of Grayndler. It is a much larger area. The reason for this is that it has more open space recreational areas and it has fewer people who have not yet become citizens. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Giles)Order!

The Opposition therefore believes that this clause should be deleted from the Bill and the existing provision that a redistribution may take place if a quarter of the seats are outside the 10 per cent tolerance should remain.  I am not excited about some of the arguments provided about representation with regard to this provision because I was in this House when Ministers belonging to the National Country Party would not provide any facilities to make it easier for members who talk about representing large electorates to represent those large electorates or for the electors to contact the members. They were as barren of facilities as the Nullarbor Plain. I suggest that honourable members who allowed Ministers to take that course concerning their problems of representation are now shedding crocodile tears. I believe that this clause is designed to prevent disruption but, because we have just agreed to clause 7, it will create excessive disparity between electorates.

The opposition which haS just been put forward to clause 10 is simply humbug because, as was explained in the second reading speech on this Bill, the 7 year minimum requirement for a redistribution is justified when we look at the historical record in this country of when redistributions have taken place. We are told that 7 years is too long a span of time, but when we examine the record we see that, with the exception of the occasional State redistribution, one national redistribution was carried out in 1 906, one in 1 9 1 3, one in 1 922, one in 1934, one in 1949, one in 1955, one in 1968, and we are about to carry out one this year. That means that we have had only 8 redistributions in the 76 years since Federation. On average that means that we have had one distribution every 9½ years.  Yet Opposition supporters have the audacity to stand up here this afternoon and this evening, and in the Senate yesterday afternoon and yesterday evening, and put forward token opposition by saying that this 7 year clause is precluding the workings of democracy in Australia. The fact is that, based on history in this country, this clause is quite sensible. I reject completely the tacit opposition I described it before as humbugthat has been put forward here tonight. If you teach a galah to say often enough that Polly likes crackers, everyone begins to believe that Polly likes crackers. All of the performing and the grandstanding by honourable members opposite as to the unfairness of the redistribution proposals in the Commonwealth Electoral Act as it stands today, and as it has stood in the past, is simply a case of Polly liking crackers; if you say it often enough some people will believe you. I believe that the electoral record of this country indicates that the vast majority of Australians have rejected the concept that the Labor Party has struggled for threequarters of a century on unfair boundaries. The Labor Party has had it fair all right; it has just been its performance which has kept it for some 60 years on the Opposition benches.

We all know that if the general election in 1978 merely returns representation to normal, 20 Liberal members are going to leave this chamber. Obviously that is reinforced by what the Liberal Party has acquiesced inin this legislation tonight.  In addition, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) referred to our objection to the provisions about a 7 year period between redistributions which is included in clause 10. He said that the fact that since Federation there have been 7 or 8 years between each redistribution was a good enough reason for including the provisions for a 7 year periodin this clause. Obviously the honourable member for Griffith suffered because when he went to school he was in a very large class and he could not hear the teacher clearly. To follow his theory through to its logical conclusion one has to believe that classrooms today still have to be the same size as when he went to school. He does not look at the effect or the impact of the Consideration interrupted. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Giles)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House of 18 February 1976 I shall report progress.

He did not look at the impact or the effect of merely adopting some sort of blockbusting system whereby there will be a redistribution every X number of years. Let us relate the clauses together. Honourable members opposite have fallen for the 3card trick, as the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has said, by saying that districts of 5000 square kilometres will be looked upon as something separate. The Liberal Party has the opportunity in this Parliament more than in any other parliament since Federation to get on top of the rump in the corner. But again it has capitulated completely to the whims of the National Country Party. The National Country Party has taken the Liberal Party to the dry cleaners again. The Liberal Party does not have a clue what the legislation means. The honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) who has a shining badge around his neck will have to hand it over to the Labor candidate in 2 years. A lot of the others on that side of the House will have to do the same thing a lot more than should have. This will occur because they have subjected themselves to the policies of the National Country Party. Members of the Liberal Party should know and realise whenever civil liberties are discussed that the garbage can of politics which sits in the Country Party corner does not give a damn about the civil liberties of members of the Liberal Party any more than it does about the people who support the Labor Party. This is nonsense about5000 square kilometres or an election at large if we cannot agree upon boundaries. What absolute nonsense.

I stand here and smile at the Liberal Party members who will be going back to their former occupations after the next election because they have subjected themselves to the whims of the National Country Party. They should sit in the corner which members of the National Country Party occupy and allow members of the National Country Party to occupy the benches which the Liberals occupy.

He is going to give us some ideas on what this clause means. How can the Liberal Party possibly adopt some sort of scheme which relates to area? Do members of the Liberal Party know where the National Country Party will take them next? There are only 2 members of the National Country Party in here at the moment. One is getting a bit on and very cunning and the other bloke still does not know what is going on around him. Do the Liberals know what will happen next? Sam Calder will come in here and say: Look, I cannot serve the Northern Territory  The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN Order! The honourable gentleman should refer to the honourable member for the Northern Territory.

With this device the National Country Party with 8 per cent of the vote and 19 per cent of the members will maintain their numbers. The blokes sitting in the back benches and some of the fellows on the front benches are for tatas, and they voted for the legislation. The stupidity of members of the Liberal Party in again capitulating to the National Country Party is absolutely beyond me and all my colleagues on this side of the House. They continually capitulate. Whenever legislation of this type is introduced the newspapers say that the Liberal Party will stand up this time. They say that members of the Liberal Party have hairs on their chests. They say that this time the Liberal Party will tell the National Country Party to go to blazes. Each time I say to my colleagues: Do not believe that nonsense. There must be a lot of new journalists in the House and they have to write something. This is the first time they have observed Parliament when this legislation is being introduced. When the crunch comes and Doug Anthony, Ian Sinclair and Peter Nixon walk in all the Libs are ice cream. They melt. They put up their hands. The honourable member for Holt puts up his hand to say: I do not want to serve m the next Parliament. I want to go back to my bee keeping. I am sick and tired of door knocking. I do not like serving my time in the Parliament. The honourable member for Hindmarsh is upsetting me too much. I would rather see the National Country Party have this unequal power in the Parliament. All the rest of them do the same. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) knows what it is like to be out of Parliament. Why on earth did he seek to come back again? The honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) ought to be giving evidence before the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism because he surely is a tourist in the national Parliament.

Among a miscellany of allegations, it was written that members of Parliament are exploiting a loophole in legislation which permits an MP to claim an allowance while living in his electorate. The loophole permits MPs to name Canberra as their home base. His article continued by claiming that government sources confirmed that some senior politicians were collecting their daily $37.00 at least 250 days of the year/It was this which the honourable member for Corio drew to my attention.  The allegation is false. Clause 1.8 of the Remuneration Tribunals 1976 review provides that for the purpose of payment of travelling allowance the home base shall be the home of a senator or member unless he nominates otherwise to the Minister for Administrative Services.  No member has nominated Canberra or any other place other than his place of residence as his home base. The only circumstances whereby a member can claim a travelling allowance whilst within his electorate are limited to those members who are required to travel more than 150 kilometres from their home base on parliamentary or electoral business within the electorate. Under such circumstances an allowance of $37 per overnight stay is payable for up to 12 overnight stays per annum.","N/A","NEWSPAPER ARTICLE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I understand that to date the provisions of the legislation have not been applied, but that the Californian canning peach industry expects that the necessary procedures to implement the provisions in respect of its products will shortly be initiated. The Australian Government is very concerned at the possible effects of the legislation, if implemented, on those Australian exports which compete with Californian products in third country markets. Discussions have been held with appropriate U.S. authorities and the matter is being pursued with the new U.S. Federal Administration and with Californian authorities. (2)Under the Canned Fruits Excise Act (1963) the Australian Government administered a levy on domestic sales of canned deciduous fruit which the Australian Canned Fruits Board allocated to canneries for export assistance. This arrangement, the socalled Market Development Allowance, was discontinued following U.S. complaints in 196768.

(2) This claim appears to have been based on the situation that gifts to the Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated are specifically tax deductible under section 78(l)(a)(xliv) and that the Foundations constitution enables it to provide assistance to, or cooperate with, other bodies concerned with or interested in conservation. The question whether gifts made in circumstances such as these would be allowable as tax deductions is primarily one for the Commissioner of Taxation to determine according to law and the advice I have received from the Commissioner is that, in his view, the answer would depend upon whether the gift is to a fund which remains in the control of the initial recipient or which passes to the organisation on whose behalf it was received. (3)and (4) The secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act preclude the Commissioner from divulging information on the particular matter that has been furnished to him for the purposes of that Act The Commissioner is, however, able to say that, to his knowledge, no organisation to which gifts are specifically deductible under the taxation law is now entering into arrangements of this sort","Tax Deductible Donation Accounts (Question No. 1892)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[7]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This document, which was signed by several hundred Czechoslovak citizens, was published widely in the Western press on 67 January 1977 and deals with the question of human rights and civil liberties in Czechoslovakia. (2)Sections of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe dealing with the protection of Human rights and with the principle of noninterference in other countries affairs are set out below. I might add that although, as a nonEuropean country, Australia did not attend the Helsinki Conference, the Government fully supports the principles of the Final Act of that Conference and sets particular store by Article No. VII on Respect for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which clearly places an obligation on all signatories to promote and respect human rights and civil liberties in their respective countries. Final Act of CSCE: Article I. Sovereign equality, respect for the rights inherent in sovereignty The participating States will respect each others sovereign equality and individuality as well as all the rights inherent in and encompassed by its sovereignty, including in particular the right of every State to juridical equality, to territorial integrity and to freedom and political independence. They will also respect each others right freely to choose and develop its political, social, economic and cultural systems as well as its right to determine its laws and regulations. Within the framework of international law, all the participating States have equal rights and duties. They will respect each others right to define and conduct as it wishes its relations with other States in accordance with international law and in the spirit of the present Declaration. They consider that their frontiers can be changed, in accordance with international law, by peaceful means and by agreement. They also have the right to belong or not to belong to international organisations, to be or not to be a party to bilateral or multilateral treaties including the right to be or not to be a party to treaties of alliance; they also have the right to neutrality. Final Act of CSCE: Article VI Nonintervention in internal affairs The participating States will refrain from any intervention, direct or indirect, individual or collective, in the internal or external affairs falling within the domestic jurisdiction of another participating State, regardless of their mutual relations. They will accordingly refrain from any form of armed intervention or threat of such intervention against another participating State. They will likewise in all circumstances refrain from any other act of military, or of political, economic or other coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by another participating State of the rights inherent in its sovereignty ana thus to secure advantages of any kind. Accordingly, they will, inter alia, refrain from direct or indirect assistance to terrorist activities, or to subversive or other activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another participating State. Final Act of CSCE: Article VII. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief The participating States will respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. They will promote and encourage the effective exercise of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and other rights and freedoms all of which derive from the inherent dignity of the human person and are essential for his free and full development. Within this framework the participating States will recognise and respect the freedom of the individual to profess and practise, alone or in community with others, religion or belief acting in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience. The participating States on whose territory national minorities exist will respect the right of persons belonging to such minorities to equality before the law, will afford them the full opportunity for the actual enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and will, in this manner, protect their legitimate interests in this sphere. The participating States recognise the universal significance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for which is an essential factor for the peace, justice and wellbeing necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations and cooperation among themselves as among all States. They will constantly respect these rights and freedoms in their mutual relations and will endeavour jointly and separately, including in cooperation with the United Nations, to promote universal and effective respect for them. They confirm the right of the individual to know and act upon his rights and duties in this field. In the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the participating States will act in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They will also fulfil their obligations as set forth in the international declarations and agreements in this field, including inter alia the International Covenants on Human Rights, by which they may be bound.","Charter 77 (Question No. 1894)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They have shown that the use of low voltage stimulation of beef carcasses prevents muscle shortening, the major cause of toughness in meat. The shock is directed into the carcass through electrodes a few minutes after slaughter. The voltage used in CSIRO experiments is within the safety limit specified by the State Electricity Authorities. The electrical stimulation speeds up rigor mortis whilst the carcass is still warm so that the softness of the natural muscle is largely preserved. Without an accelerated process of rigor mortis which normally takes 24 hours, the muscles can shorten and become set as tougher meat. Muscle shortening may be reduced by slow cooling of the carcass before rigor mortis but danger of spoilage would increase. The accelerated rigor mortis overcomes the present conflict between fast chilling to avoid spoiling and slow chilling to avoid toughness. CSIRO compared the toughness of meat from carcasses both with and without electrical stimulation and found that the stimulation treatment caused a marked increase in tenderness. The method is likely to be attractive to industry because it is effective, simple and safe, and CSIRO is currently carrying out an investigation at meat works level with a view to recommending the most practical procedures. CSIRO scientists are also studying methods of reforming chopped up tough cuts of meat into steaks with the tenderness characteristics of good quality more expensive cuts such as rump steak. There are also other currently available procedures to tenderise meat such as the use of enzymes, ageing and tenderstretching, all of which are in use commercially to some small extent.","Meat Tenderising (Question No. 2057)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[32]/answer[1]/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

September 1976 is the most recent month for which data are available for both employed and unemployed persons. To extract figures for all months in each year would involve more clerical labour than can be made available with current staffing levels in the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.

Unemployed in the Construction Industry are the numbers of unemployed persons registered for employment in the construction industry with the Commonwealth Employment Service. The occupational categories covered in this instance are skilled building and construction workers, building labourers, and other building and construction workers. The data from which these figures are extracted are available at the Central Office of my Department in Melbourne, but the work involved in extracting them on a monthly basis would be even greater than that required for the extraction of the required data from the employment series.

(b)The forecasting of significant changes and developments in the locust population. (c)The undertaking of control operations. (d)The development of improved control measures and strategies. (e)The monitoring of all actions and the effects of control operations. (f)The provision of assistance to individual States by means of advice on local Australian plague locust problems. The functions are directed at combating outbreaks or potential outbreaks of the Australian Plague Locust in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia considered likely to result in damage to rural industries in another State. (2)There are 19 positions attached to the Commission of which nine are occupied. The remainder are in the course of being filled. (3)As soon as staff appointments permitted, the Commission commenced surveys directed at determining the status of locust activity. During the recent outbreaks the Commission mounted 2 control campaigns; the first in the HillstonHay area of New South Wales from 518 November 1976 and the second in the Jerilderie district of New South Wales from 717 December 1976. Both campaigns complemented those conducted by the New South Wales Government. (4)At present Commission staff are involved primarily in survey work in New South Wales and Queensland aimed at monitoring locust activity. Further control operations by the Commission will depend on the evaluation of that activity, especially in regard to the threat it poses for rural industries in other States. As on earlier occasions the control operations would involve aerial spraying in relatively remote pastoral areas where land owner and State control activity is most likely to be minimal. The extent of spraying would, of course, be limited by resources available to the Commission.

In the first place there would be a risk of the list not being exhaustive, and secondly, of the possibility of a stigma being attached to those listed towns, or their doctors, in which only a small minority of the doctors are carrying out what I consider an unethical practice.  This matter is of continuing concern to the Government and I have offered the Minister for Health in New South Wales any help that I can give to try to resolve the problem and have appealed to the Australian Medical Association to campaign among its members for a cessation of this discriminatory practice which, I am glad to say, is restricted to a minority of its members.","Australian Plague Locust Commission (Question No. 2025)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[55]/answer[2]/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

(2)I am advised that the CSIRO has been undertaking research on these matters over a number of years. (3)I refer the honourable member to pages 2627 in my Departments submission to the Inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment into the Impact on the Australian Environment of the current Woodship Industry program. (4)I am advised that the fungus referred to in the articlePhytophthora cinnamomi and the dieback condition with which it can be associated are two entirely different things. The fungus is associated with some occurrences of dieback in some forest species and types. However, dieback can result from a number of causes, singly or in combination, which can include fungal pathogens, insect attack, fire, drought, prolonged flooding and nutritional disorders. Dieback associated with fungal attack of course is not new to the Australian scene, and Phytophthora cinnamomi has been recognised for some time as a serious threat to some of our more valuable eucalypt forests. There is no doubt that this pathogen has the potential for becoming a serious problem in all southern states; as such, I believe the problem deserves even wider recognition. The pathogen has been identified in every Australian state and, contrary to the impression given by the National Times article, the weight of scientific evidence supports a view that the disease is indigenous and not recently introduced to this country. Dieback has been a subject for research by many organisations in Australia, including all forest authorities, most agriculture departments, CSIRO and many universities. In addition there is considerable research being undertaken overseas. I am concerned about the environmental implications of widespread attack not only on our forests, but on other agricultural and horticultural crops susceptible to this disease. I believe that research expenditure on the problem must be intensified if we are to achieve any major breakthrough on control in the foreseeable future.","Dieback Fungus Disease (Question No. 2041)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[56]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
