and(b) noting also that persons under 21 years constituted 22.6 per cent of the Australian Public Service staff in 1966; falling to 12.2 per cent in 1974, and falling further to an all-time low of 6.7 per cent as at 31 December 1983,calls on the Federal Government to instruct the Public Service Board to take positive action to remedy the apparent structural bias in appointment procedures, which at present discriminate against youth.Senator Harradine: I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:That the Senate notes with concern that over the past two decades families have been subjected to increasing pressures from indirect taxation, as well as from direct taxation, and that moves to downgrade the spouse rebate and family allowances are a further example of this iniquitous trend of placing an inordinate taxation burden on families, particularly one-income families.Senator Harradine: I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:That the Senate notes- (a) that the United States Government has withheld funding from the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) because of that organisations involvement in abortion promotion and coercive family planning programs;

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator CHANEY","EF4","(Western Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)","18","—by leave-The Select Committee on Allegations Concerning a Judge was established in response to very serious problems which confronted the Senate following the tabling of the report of the first Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge. As the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, said:The issues concerning the Government and Senate arising out of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge are about as serious as could possibly be imagined.In short, the first Select Committee had received evidence from Mr Briese, the Chairman of the Bench of Stipendiary Magistrates in New South Wales, who made very serious allegations against a High Court judge, Mr Justice Murphy.The issue before the Senate, difficult and all as it was, was made more complex by two other factors: The first Senate Committee was divided about the conclusion to be drawn from Mr Brieses evidence before it and submissions had been made to the Committee by the senior counsel for the judge that the judge was entitled to be accorded treatment in accordance with the rules of natural justice. The first Senate Committee had not been able to accede to this submission, particularly the claim that the judges senior counsel should be entitled to cross-examine Mr Briese on his allegations, because of the existing Standing Orders of the Senate. All parties were agreed that, in the words of the then Attorney-General, Further action of some kind needs to be taken to clear the air, but the Senate was divided about the nature of that action.The Opposition and the Australian Democrats were of the view that an independent parliamentary commissioner should be appointed to conduct a hearing in accordance with the principles of natural justice and to make findings of fact which would be reported to the Senate for its further consideration of the problem. The Government, however, believed that the evidence before the first Senate Committee and other relevant material should be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether a prosecution should be launched. Furthermore, the Government refused to co-operate in the appointment of an independent commissioner which would have required legislation, and in the absence of such co-operation that particular option was not open.In the event, therefore, the Senate established the second Select Committee, which was given the power to appoint commissioners who would participate in the Committees deliberations and report their findings to the Committee. This was a novel procedure for the Senate to adopt and a further step in the development of the Senates powers and the committee system which has been such a notable feature of parliamentary life for more than a decade.Doubts were entertained in a number of quarters about the formation of a committee in this form, and indeed, the proponents of it readily conceded that it was a second best procedure. It was, however, the best procedure open to the Senate, given the lack of Government co-operation. The proceedings of the Committee, which heard evidence from a number of witnesses in public and accorded the highest principles of natural justice to all those concerned with its deliberations, not only dispelled those doubts but must now be accepted as a notable achievement by the Senate, regardless of what judgment may be made about its findings and recommendations.The Opposition accepts that, in view of the charges which have now been laid by the Director of Public Prosecutions against Mr Justice Murphy and the committal proceedings which are about to commence in respect of those charges, no comment should be made about the Committees findings at this stage and indeed while the judicial process is taking its course. Furthermore, the Opposition does not believe that it is an appropriate time to debate the subject at all and does not propose to do so at this time. Nevertheless, the Opposition has at all times maintained and continues to maintain that the ultimate question at issue in this matter-namely, whether a Federal judge has been guilty of proved misbehaviour justifying his removal from office-is one for Parliament and Parliament alone to decide. As Senator Durack put it, speaking on behalf of the Opposition in the Senate on 4 September 1984:. . . the responsibility for this issue rests with the Parliament. It does not rest with the courts. It certainly does not rest with the Executive. It rests with the Parliament.As a matter of comity between the Parliament and the courts and in the interest of according full justice to Mr Justice Murphy while his case is before a court, Parliament should desist from giving this matter any further consideration or seeking to discharge its responsibility. It is fundamental to our system of criminal justice that a person charged with an offence is entitled to a fair trial and should not have that right compromised.","N/A","SELECT COMMITTEE ON ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING A JUDGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

However, as the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Neil Brown, has said, the constitutional issue arising from the power and responsibility given to the Parliament under section 72 of the Constitution is quite different from the issue of Mr Justice Murphys trial on the offence with which he is charged. This responsibility of the Parliament, as the elected representative of the people, cannot be waived and will remain, irrespective of the outcome of the trial. When Mr Justice Murphys trial is concluded, the Opposition will consider what further parliamentary proceedings, if any, it should take.","N/A","SELECT COMMITTEE ON ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING A JUDGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator HAINES","1H4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A","20","—by leave-The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Chaney, has outlined the story which lies behind the report of the Senate Select Committee on Allegations Concerning a Judge. During the debate in the Senate prior to the establishment of the Committee I stressed, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, the Democrats determination to ensure that Mr Justice Murphy was granted every possible right in accordance with the principles of natural justice. At the same time we accepted that it was essential for the Parliament to fulfil the heavy responsibility placed on it under section 72 (ii) of the Constitution. The lengthy negotiations which took place and the variety of options which were considered by members of the Senate before the second Select Committee, with its commissioners and counsel, was appointed have already been covered. The result of that Committees hearings is printed in the report tabled in the Senate today.At this stage I do not want, nor do I think it is appropriate, to canvass the conclusions arrived at by the members of the Committee and the commissioners assisting the Committee. We had specific terms of reference, and we were asked to make findings on specific matters. We did so. In view of the fact that charges have now been laid against Mr Justice Murphy by Mr Temby, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and that the hearings are due to begin in a few weeks, I endorse the comments made earlier with regard to the need to avoid commenting on the issues at this stage. Nor do I believe it is appropriate or even fitting to canvass what might happen in the future with regard to this matter. Without for one moment resiling from the responsibility placed specifically on the two Houses of this Parliament in section 72 (ii) of the Constitution, I can only repeat what I said on behalf of the Australian Democrats last December:The matter is now in the hands of [the courts] and must be left to the due processes of the law. Any Parliamentary debate before the [determination of] the Judges innocence or guilt could well be prejudicial to a fair trial and no responsible House of Parliament or member of a House of Parliament should even contemplate it.","N/A","SELECT COMMITTEE ON ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING A JUDGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator BUTTON","4F4","(Victoria-","ALP","Leader of the Government in the Senate)","21","—I move:That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 11 January 1985, of the Rt Hon. Sir William John McKell, GCMG, AC, a former Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1947 to 1953 and Premier of New South Wales from 1941 to 1947; and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.Sir William McKell was born in New South Wales on 26 September 1891. He had a very full, long and productive life which encompassed all the formative years and the most momentous events of a modern epoch of Australian history. He left school at the age of 13 and became an apprentice boilermaker and formed, at a very early age, an apprentices union. He was subsequently a union official for some time and was then elected to the New South Wales Parliament in 1917. In his early days during his period in the New South Wales Parliament, which spanned 30 years, he studied law and was called to the Bar in 1925. He held several ministerial posts in Labor governments. He became Leader of the Opposition in 1939 and was Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales from May 1941 until his resignation in 1947. He was Governor-General of Australia from 1947 to 1953.Sir William McKell had a remarkable career of service to the Australian Labor Party, to the Parliament of New South Wales and to the people of Australia. His premiership of New South Wales embraced the entire period of the war in the Pacific, while his years as Governor-General covered the years of the post-war transition. After the burden of the war years and the two most difficult of the immediate post-war years, Sir William McKell proposed to retire into private life at the early age of 56. At that time he had no expectations that he would be appointed as the second Australian-born Governor-General. He could not have anticipated the wrath and hostility the appointment caused in certain quarters, a resentment almost incomprehensible to most of the present generation of Australians. It is a mark of a man that the tremendous personal integrity, natural dignity and strength of character McKell brought to his office as Governor-General converted all but his most ardent detractors into admirers. In the discharge of his office as Governor-General he adhered scrupulously to the fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy that the Governor-General acts on the advice of the elected government.The Australian Labor Party had a great servant in Bill McKell. He was a great party man, a great Australian and a great democrat. He was a patriot and he had great faith in the people and future of his country. He enjoyed that faith and belief in the future of this country and an active interest in public affairs until quite recently before his death. It was a remarkably long life, a remarkable career and a great contribution to this country. I am privileged to be able to move the motion which I have moved.","N/A","DEATH OF SIR WILLIAM McKELL","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Sir William McKell made a remarkable contribution to Australia over a very long life in a range of ways. I suppose that in an era when the position of Australian youth is under considerable scrutiny and when there is a lot of concern about the future of many young Australians, it is worth looking back on the life of Sir William McKell and seeing that in a way he represented what we would hope Australia would be for all its citizens. He was a man who had left school when he was 13, who took on an apprenticeship and different forms of studies and who was admitted to the Bar and became a Queens Counsel. He served in many different ways. He was a very great success in many different ways.He left a lot of political monuments. I understand that he established the State Housing Commission, the University of New South Wales and the Kosciusko National Park. I suppose they are all institutions which are likely to be with us for a very long time. As I understand it, it is quite true that his appointment as Governor-General in 1947 was attacked. It is perhaps also true that the attitude of his Labor colleagues was not quite as charitable in 1951 when he acceded to the request for a double dissolution which was made by the then Prime Minister. Perhaps that also is a useful reminder to us that the contentious matters of any particular year look less contentious in retrospect and perhaps there is some evening out in these matters.My only personal contact with the late Sir William McKell really was quite indirect; we shared a common car driver in Sydney-Mr Andrew Donaghey. He expressed the greatest devotion to Sir William McKell. I really feel I got to know Sir William quite well through Andrew Donaghey, including the various periods of illness Sir William had over the last few years. The affection that that man expressed for Sir William McKell is, I suspect, the sort of respect Sir William McKell would have wished to have from the Australians he served. The Opposition expresses to the family of Sir William McKell its respect for him and its wholehearted support for the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in this place.","N/A","DEATH OF SIR WILLIAM McKELL","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I came to know a remarkable man of very considerable, quiet dignity and strength, a man with a great vision for Australia, a vision which crossed party lines. In my view he was a person who saw many significant reforms. For example, in my own State of New South Wales he had an understanding of rural matters and in particular of the problems of the country people. He had a considerable desire to assist in that regard.I knew him in his later life. I was privileged to meet him on a number of occasions. He was a very interesting man and an interesting conversationalist. He retained until the very last a keen intellect and a great affection for Australia and for Australians. There may have been controversy in those days; that is in the past. Let us simply say that he proved that he could hold any office in this country with dignity and success. He has made for himself a niche in the history of Australia.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SIBRAA","EJ4","(New South Wales)","ALP","N/A","22","—As a senator from New South Wales I wish to associate myself with this motion of condolence for the late Sir William McKell, a remarkable Australian and one of the great Labor Premiers of New South Wales. Sir William McKell was born in 1891-the year in which the Australian Labor Party was formed. During his lifetime he saw the Labor Party emerge as the major political force in New South Wales. The Labor governments that he led clearly established a style and an agenda for all future New South Wales Labor governments. McKell was directly responsible for fashioning Labors 1941 electoral triumph, and subsequent electoral triumphs. For example, his selection of local identities such as Billy Sheahan, Jack Renshaw and Eddie Graham, to name but a few, to run for the Labor Party in rural seats proved enormously successful.The years of McKell Labor government were responsible for many lasting reforms. Chief amongst them included an expanded workers compensation Act, a new factories and shops Act, a lay-by sales reform Act, a hire purchase Act, a money-lenders Act and pensions for miners at the age of 60. The McKell governments were also responsible for performing massive civil airport and road construction works in New South Wales. In addition to those reforms McKell was a great conservationist. In 1943 McKell was directly responsible for claiming one and a quarter million acres of the Southern Alps for the Kosciusko National Park. Bob Carr, the New South Wales Minister for Planning and Environment, in a recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald, noted:It was the first great conservationist battle and McKell was the first significant environmentalist in politics.The McKell legacy is afforded special prominence by the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party through an annual lecture named in his honour. The inaugural speech was delivered by the Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, in the presence of Sir William in 1982. Unfortunately, ill-health prevented him from attending the 1984 lecture delivered by the noted Australian author, Thomas Keneally. However, the lecture will continue to highlight the memory of Sir William and his distinguished career for many years to come.In conclusion, I again refer to the words of Bob Carr, who said of Sir William:His career had demonstrated that in politics a single individual with good values could make a difference. Hike to the peak of Kosciusko and look across the Alps. What memorial could beat that.","N/A","DEATH OF SIR WILLIAM McKELL","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The death of Indira Gandhi was a tragic and wanton act of terrorism which was deplored and regretted by all Australians. Mrs Gandhi was one of the great leaders of our time. She was the head of the worlds largest democracy and she guided Indias progress, against huge odds, in the fields of agriculture, manufacturing and science. Today India has one of the 10 largest economies in the world, with a strong technological and manufacturing base and having achieved a notable degree of self-reliance in agriculture. India has become a major force in international affairs. Under Mrs Gandhi, India assumed the leadership of the non-aligned movement. Mrs Gandhi, at the time of her death, was Chairman of the Commonwealth.Indira Gandhi enjoyed the greatest admiration and respect. Her strength, courage and ability will be sorely missed by the people of India and the absence of those characteristics will be noted throughout the rest of the world. Shortly before Mrs Gandhis death, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) invited her to visit Australia. That was not to be. Perhaps the result of the recent election in India indicates something of the feelings of the Indian people. I do not wish to place interpretations on that result but perhaps it can be seen in some ways as a mark of respect to the life of Mrs Gandhi. The Government hopes that the new Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, will be able to take up the invitation to visit Australia extended to the late Mrs Gandhi. I know that all honourable senators will join me in expressing profound sympathy at Indias great loss.","N/A","DEATH OF MRS INDIRA GANDHI","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Like the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), the Opposition deplores the circumstances of her death. It is a matter of intense regret that the leader of one of the great democracies should meet her end in such a way. Mrs Gandhi had a long and distinguished career. It was a career which was sometimes controversial and a matter of some debate. It is significant to note that after what was perhaps the most controversial period of her reign she lost government. I suppose the best test of all of whether one operates in a democracy is that when one governs in a way which is unacceptable one is rejected by the people. Mrs Gandhi was out of office for only a short time and was re-elected and served as Prime Minister until her death. The Opposition joins with the Government in expressing sympathy and regret at the death of Indira Gandhi, and I agree with the sentiments which have been expressed by Senator Button.","N/A","DEATH OF MRS INDIRA GANDHI","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator PETER RAE","0P7","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A","24","—Major-General Robert Hurley Wordsworth was a senator from 1950 to 1959. Wordy, as he was known to many of those who knew him in his later years, earned two mentions in dispatches as well as a CB and a CBE during his long period of service in both the Australian Imperial Force and the Indian Army. He was born at Collarenebri in New South Wales in 1894 and died last year in November, a resident of Longford in Tasmania, at the age of 90. He is survived by his widow, a son and a daughter.It would be true to say that he had both a long and a distinguished career in Australia, as soldier, farmer, parliamentarian and civil administrator. He joined the AIF at the outbreak of war in August 1914 and embarked for the Middle East in September that year. He spent his twenty-first birthday at Gallipoli. In Egypt he served with the Light Horse and participated in the Battle of Beersheba, which saw the worlds last great mounted charge. He later transferred to the Indian Army and served in, among other places, Afghanistan. In the Second World War he served in the Middle East in Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Lebanon as a major-general in the Armoured Corps, and received significant acknowledgment of his services, having been mentioned twice in dispatches and having been awarded the CB and CBE. He retired to Tasmania in 1947 on the independence of India, and in 1949 was elected to this chamber as a representative of the State of Tasmania. Perhaps as would be expected with such a background, he became known in this place for his interest, expertise and contributions on foreign affairs and defence. He was notable for looking after the interests of returned servicemen, and in the sphere of international relations, especially in South and South East Asia, he was one of the first parliamentarians to warn of Soviet ambitions in South East Asia.Major-General Wordsworth was involved in and concerned with the development of the Colombo Plan. He laid great stress on the interdependence of the Wests defences against the Soviet Union, and it may be regarded as of some significance that he was a great supporter of the importance of ANZUS. He did not at any time forget that he was a representative of Tasmania and put that States economic interests well to the fore. He was a keen advocate of shipping and was aware of the problems of the timber industry. In 1959 he retired, again to farming, and in 1961 was elected President of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. He served in that capacity until appointed in 1962 as Administrator of Norfolk Island. Later he came home again to Tasmania and ultimately retired to Longford where he lived quietly, proudly watching his son David enter farming and, later, a political career in Western Australia, where he has been a Liberal MLC since 1971 and was a Minister from 1977 to 1982. David Wordsworth also served the party organisation in both Tasmania and Western Australia.Major-General Wordsworths widow, Mrs Wordsworth, still lives at Longford and I am sure that all honourable senators will join me in expressing our condolences to our former colleagues widow and to his daughter and son. I believe that Australia has every reason to be proud of the public service given by this very distinguished Australian citizen. A man of courage, a man of foresight, a man of determination, a man of public spirit, he left his mark on this country.","N/A","DEATH OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBERS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to speak, first of all, about former Senator Robert Herbert Lacey, universally known as Bert Lacey. Former Senator Lacey was a long time servant of the Labor movement of this country and the Australian Labor Party in particular. He was formerly an organiser in the Australian Workers Union, having worked in many occupations, particularly in rural areas, in construction work, in mining and in other activities of that type. He was an organiser in that union until 1947 when he became General Secretary of the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Labor Party. He remained General Secretary of my branch of the Party until he entered the Senate in 1965. He was for a short time a member of the House of Assembly in Tasmania, representing the seat of Denison. Those were the days when general secretaries of the Labor Party had a difficult time because of lack of resources and the lack of remuneration attached to the job. Bert Lacey kept that job from 1947 until 1965. It was a difficult and onerous job, and he did it well.Even to those who had differences with him, he was a forthright man of strong views. After he left that position, which was the time I first became active in the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party, he certainly had no hesitation in letting his views be known to those of us who were active in the Party, particularly those of us who became members of parliament. I used to say to him that he never lost his capacity to use the telephone, and he often gave his views very vigorously on the phone to me and, I am sure, to other members of the Party. Even when we differed with some of those views, we respected them very much. People on both sides of this House knew Bert Lacey. Like many others, I regret his passing at the age of 84. I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in giving condolences to his surviving relatives.In passing, I did know Major-General Wordsworth briefly. I met him after I had become a senator when he used to stay, and in fact for a short time lived, in the town of Legana in Tasmania where I lived. We first struck up an acquaintance because we were gardening and he quickly told me what I was doing wrong with my gardening, as he was likely to tell people about any subject that he had views about. He then discovered that the person he was talking to was actually a senator and he gave me his views on the Senate and senators he had known. When he found out which side of the Parliament I was on he told me exactly what he thought of my political views and of the views of my colleagues. He was a forthright man. As Senator Peter Rae said, he obviously served this country well and was respected throughout Tasmania during his years of service. I support the words of Senator Rae and join him in giving my condolences and, I am sure, the condolences of all honourable senators on this side to his relatives.","N/A","DEATH OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBERS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator PETER RAE","0P7","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A","25","—by leave -Although my Leader moved a motion in relation to both former senators, I wished Senator Grimes to speak first in relation to Robert Herbert Lacey, or Bert Lacey as he was known. He was a senator for Tasmania from 1965 to 1971 and he died in November last year at the age of 84. I had the pleasure of serving in this chamber with him for three years. As I knew him both here and generally in relation to politics in Tasmania, he was a quiet, gentle man but, as Senator Grimes has said, he was a very firm contributor both to his Party and to his constituents. He was a firm contributor to his union members when he was the Australian Workers Union organiser from 1938 to 1946 and General Secretary to the Australian Labor Party from 1947 to 1965, to the electors of Denison when he served as a member of the House of Assembly and later to the electors of Tasmania from 1965 to 1971.As I recall Bert Laceys interests in this chamber, he was particularly interested in the welfare of his fellow man. Social services and the care of Commonwealth prisoners were two of the things to which I recall his paying particular attention. He expressed his concern in relation to the Vietnam War, a matter of considerable concern to many people in the period during which he served in this chamber. He also, like former Senator Wordsworth, did not forget his duty to look after the economic interests of Tasmania. He was particularly concerned about shipping. He was a quiet man of dignity who served his fellow man throughout his long life. Opposition senators join in paying tribute to the lifetime of dedication to public welfare displayed by Bert Lacey and in expressing our condolences to his widow and his family.","N/A","DEATH OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBERS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I express my condolences to his relatives and to the relatives of Bert Lacey, whom I knew very well and who was a very close and personal friend of myself and my family. Bert Lacey was born on 12 January 1900 at Maryborough in Victoria. He had four sisters and a brother. Berts mother died giving birth to her sixth child and Bert became virtually an orphan. He was raised in extremely hard conditions and was provided with scarcely enough food to sustain him. He attended the Central Training School in Ballarat. He was so small and thin that the boys at the school nicknamed him Spider. His family recalls the story of one of his teachers, who would often ask Bert to deliver messages to the teachers home, knowing that his wife would reward Bert with a few slices of cake.By the time Bert was 12 years of age he was working after school on a dairy farm milking cows. Those who are best qualified to know say that Berts childhood included periods of deprivation, hunger and bullying, so much so that at the age of 16 he weighed only six stone. His older brother served in the First World War and Bert was very anxious to serve as well, but his guardian refused to give permission for Bert to enlist. In January 1918, on Berts eighteenth birthday, he joined the Army but the war was almost over so he did not serve overseas. After the war he returned to farm work in the Jamieson area in Victoria. The hours, of course, were long and hard.Bert then got a job at a gold mine at Woods Point, Victoria, working above ground. Here he became friendly with a couple of Italian miners who taught him how to box to defend himself. During the 1920s Bert went to Tasmania and worked at the Mathinna gold mine. He became engaged to Mary Emmeline Clark. The former mine manager from the Woods Point gold mine went to New Zealand and asked Bert Lacey to join him, so Bert and Mary were married in 1926 and went to New Zealand. Before too long the mine failed and Bert went to work in the timber industry and he and Mary lived in a logging camp. Two years later they returned to Tasmania for the birth of their first child.Bert Lacey worked at the Storeys Creek mine as a tool sharpener. However, during the Depression that mine closed and Bert was thrown out of work. It was then that his second child was born. He then went gold sluicing. About this time he became interested in politics and the trade union movement. When he found some miners were being underpaid he suggested that they join a union. The mine boss called Bert an agitator and threw a few punches at him. Berts training from the Italians proved very useful and the mine boss soon found Bert was more than able to defend himself. Some years later that man went to Bert for help over a compensation claim and Bert worked hard to get him his rightful dues. That was typical of the character of Bert Lacey.Berts mining experiences included open cut tin mining at Goshen and underground mining at Rosebery. It was on the west coast of Tasmania that Bert worked with Eric Reece and was appointed a union representative for the Australian Workers Union. When a union organiser was needed by the AWU on the north-west coast in 1938, Bert was appointed to that position. The west coast organiser at that time was Eric Reece and they both became active in the Australian Labor Party. While Bert was the AWU organiser on the north-west coast he was living in Ulverstone and his two youngest children were born there.In 1946 the ALP endorsed two AWU organisers for the Darwin electorate, which is now known as the Braddon electorate, for the House of Assembly election. Those two AWU organisers were Eric Reece and Bert Lacey. Bert lodged his nomination for the election at the electoral office in Devonport but, on his way back home to Ulverstone, was involved in a collision with a motor car. Bert was travelling by motorbike, which was the form of transport provided by the AWU at the time for its organisers. His injuries were very severe indeed and he spent five months in the local hospital unable to take part in the election campaign. When it was suggested in 1946 that his leg should be amputated, Bert was transferred to Hobart. However, doctors managed to save his leg. As a matter of fact, last year, a few months before his death, Bert had part of a leg removed. That election in 1946 saw the entry into the Tasmanian Parliament of Eric Reece, who went on to become the Premier of the State. No doubt Bert Lacey also would have won a seat on that occasion had it not been for the road accident.The leg injury meant the end of Berts work as a union organiser. In 1947 the Tasmanian branch of the ALP decided for the first time in its history to appoint a full time State secretary, and Bert was selected for that office. He held that position for 18 years-until 1965, which was the year he took his place in the Senate. A successor in that office was Kath Venn. One of my regrets is that Kath is not here to pay tribute to Bert.","N/A","DEATH OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBERS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

She is not here by reason of the fact that although she received the third highest primary vote of any Senate candidate at the election she was defeated because the State ALP registered its how to vote ticket to ensure that the preference votes of those who placed a number 1 in the ALP box went to a man whose vote helped bring down the Tasmanian Labor Government.During all the years in which Bert worked as General Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, the Labor Party was successfully returned to office in Tasmania on each occasion on which it faced election. That was so in most cases, of course, so far as his successor was concerned. Bert was a very loyal and conscientious servant of the Labor Party. As money was always in short supply, often he had to wait for his salary.Bert was a candidate in no fewer than eight parliamentary elections, but usually circumstances were against him. Following the 1946 House of Assembly election in Tasmania, Bert stood at two further House of Assembly elections. In 1956 he was a candidate for Denison but just missed out on winning one of the seats. In early 1959 a sitting member retired from the House of Assembly. As is the case under the Hare-Clark system, a recount was required to fill the vacancy. Bert Lacey was declared elected at the recount, but before he could take his seat in Parliament the Premier called a State election and Bert lost out again.In 1954 the ALP endorsed a candidate, Bill Hannon, for the Denison seat in the House of Representatives. About 30 minutes before nominations closed, Bert Lacey, as the General Secretary of the Labor Party, checked with the various electoral offices to make sure that the Labor Party candidates had lodged their nominations. He was informed that Bill Hannon had not done so. A frantic search took place to find Bill Hannon, who had apparently set out early that morning door-knocking in the electorate. When it seemed obvious that the endorsed candidate would not be found before the time for the closing of nominations Bert Lacey dashed into the electoral office and lodged a nomination for himself so that the Party would be represented at that election. Despite the lack of preparation for the campaign, Bert polled extremely well but failed to win the seat which was held by the redoubtable Athol Townley. Four years later the ALP was unable to find anyone willing to lodge an application for endorsement for the Denison seat so obligingly Bert contested the seat again. Once again he polled very well, but not well enough.In 1955 the Australian Labor Party endorsed three candidates for the Senate: Senator Nick McKenna, Bert Lacey and Bob Poke-in that order. This is an indication of the type of person Bert was. He was actually a member of the Australian Labor Party Executive at the time and he felt that perhaps he had been given second place by reason of that fact. Therefore, he told the Executive that, in fairness, because he was present when the vote was taken, he thought his name and that of Bob Poke should go in a hat and the name of the No. 3 candidate should be pulled out of the hat. Inevitably Berts name was drawn out of the hat and so at the Senate election Senator Nick McKenna held his seat and Bob Poke was elected. Bert Lacey missed out again.Finally, in 1964, Bert Lacey contested and won a seat in the Senate. He served his electors unstintingly for six years from the time he took his seat in July 1965 until 1971. In 1970 Bert Lacey was awarded life membership of the Labor Party. He was also a life member of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. During Berts time in both those organisations I knew him very well and worked closely with him. Many other people would understand his firm and gentle advice, which was always given directly and which was clear and concise. I always found it to be very worth while.Bert was a true family man, a devoted husband for 58 years. He raised a family of three daughters and one son and also raised two of his grandchildren. As has been said, he had a great interest in prisons and voluntarily worked for many years with the St Vincent de Paul Society visiting various prisons. Bert was generous and kind-hearted and would share his last dollar with anyone in need. He once bought himself a lottery ticket in the days when the first prize in Tatts was #12,000. He visited his mother-in-law and gave her the ticket. It won first prize and no one was more delighted than Bert Lacey. One of his great qualities was his ability to remain calm and unruffled and at peace in his own mind no matter how great the stress or strain in his personal life and no matter what provocation there was in his political life.Mr President, Bert Laceys simplicity, his honesty, his sense of loyalty, his courage, his unselfishness and his modesty marked him as a most remarkable man in political life, providing an example we could all do well to follow. He never entertained a mean thought or acted in any way vindictively. Bert Lacey was a Christian and a gentleman in the strongest and most refined sense.Mr President, Berts wife and his children, Margaret, Stephanie and John-Huia predeceased Bert some two or three years ago-very much appreciated your condolences and those of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other people in the Parliament upon Berts death. I simply would like to say that we have seen the passing on of a very great man who served this country long and well.","N/A","DEATH OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBERS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/speech[5]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer to Major-General Wordsworth, CBE. The late Senator Wordsworth, who passed away aged 90, had a very distinguished career in the service of his country. Few men have made such a great contribution to public life, in the Army and in the Parliament. He was a respected President of the Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party of Australia, President of the Launceston Club and Administrator of Norfolk Island.During the First World War he served at Gallipoli and in Egypt and in the Indian Cavalry. World War II dispatches bore witness to the bravery of this distinguished soldier in the Middle East. In 1944 he commanded the large Third Army in the occupation of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.Perhaps one of the greatest tributes a father can have is for his son to follow in his footsteps. His son David has chosen a political career and is now a member of the Legislative Council in the Western Australian Parliament. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere sympathy to the late senators wife, daughter and son.","N/A","DEATH OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBERS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I knew Senator Lacey not as well or for as long as some other Labor people in Tasmania, but I would like to pay a brief tribute to him. I will not repeat the details of his service but I will point out that, as well as the things already mentioned, he served in the Australian Labor Partys Federal Executive, was Federal Vice-President in 1962 and was a delegate to the Federal Conference for seven years. He remained loyal to the ALP throughout the traumas of the 1950s split despite extreme pressure. He will be remembered as a person who gave a lifetime commitment to the goals of the Labor movement, not just through his parliamentary service but through his willingness to serve the ALP and the union movement. He was made a life member of the Australian Labor Party.Despite differences of opinion that may have occurred from time to time, all people in the Party respected him. There was an indication of this when I attended his funeral. I noticed present, apart from a huge number of family and friends, a very wide range of Tasmanian Labor people including three former Premiers, the current parliamentary leader and many past and present ALP officials. I support the motion.Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBERS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A","28","—by leave-Dudley Erwin, who passed away on 29 October 1984 at the age of 67, served his country in several spheres over a period of more than 40 years. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record some of the achievements of Dudley Erwin during that period. I do so for a personal reason in that I was formerly-in 1975-elected to the seat of Ballarat in the other place in succession to Dudley Erwin who had been the member for Ballarat for 20 years.Dudley Erwin served Australia very well, as I have said, in several spheres, starting with his war service during the Second World War. He was one of the Australians to join the Services early. He joined the Royal Australian Air Force early at the beginning of 1940. He served as a navigator in the south-west Pacific and rose to the rank of flight lieutenant. In June 1943, as a member of the No. 31 Beaufighter Squadron, he took part in one of that squadrons most successful raids of the Second World War. He was subsequently appointed area navigation officer for the north-west Pacific area in 1944, a position he held until his demobilisation after the war. After the war he retained a great interest in ex-servicemen from all walks of life. He was a very strong, staunch and long-serving member of the Returned Services League and was accorded life membership of that organisation. Until his death he was very closely associated with the RSL.Dudley Erwin was first elected to Parliament for the Federal seat of Ballarat in 1955. He was re-elected on seven subsequent occasions prior to his retirement in 1975. I felt that a great honour was accorded to me when I was chosen to succeed him as the member for Ballarat. During his 20 years of parliamentary service he served on numerous parliamentary committees. He served on both House and joint committees. In particular, during the period 1962-64 he was the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Commonwealth Parliamentary and Government Publications. He was the Government Whip in the House of Representatives from 1967 until 1969 when he was appointed Minister for Air in the Gorton Government.Following his retirement from parliamentary life in 1975 Dudley Erwin became the foundation president of the Australian Association of Independent Businesses Ltd. In that capacity he devoted several years to furthering the interests of small business in Australia. So it was a very rounded and full life of public service. On behalf of the people of Ballarat, whom he represented so faithfully for so many years, on behalf of the people of Victoria and, in particular, on behalf of Senator Austin Lewis and my other Victorian colleagues, I would like to convey to his widow, Gwenda, and his three children our deep sympathy at his passing.","N/A","DEATH OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBERS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
