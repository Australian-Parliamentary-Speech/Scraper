The thing which the Leader of the Opposition is still smarting about is that more than 50 per cent of the people wanted us as the government; they did not want those opposite as the government. They knew that, if they had those opposite as the government, 70 per cent of Australian households would have been worse off under the kind of budget that they would have brought in at this time of the cycle.I have said many times that this budget does have some unpopular aspects to it. However, the important thing is that we are prepared to take the long view whilst the opposition is prepared to be squalid in its approach to these matters, turning its back on the real interests of Australia; that is, providing a stable basis on which investment can occur in Australia.What the people of Australia must understand about those opposite by now is that they stand for higher taxes, higher interest rates, higher inflation and higher deficits. What kind of a basis is that for creating investment in this country—something which the Australian people, I would have thought, to a man and woman, want and something which can provide the jobs? Those opposite, through their disruptive activities and through their unscrupulous approach to these matters, are creating the kind of uncertainty which is entirely non-conducive to creating an investment climate here in Australia.The Leader of the Opposition has to understand that sometimes in public life you have to take the national interest in the long term, do the things which you know are right and not simply run your policies on the basis of the occasional opinion poll.As far as I am concerned, we will continue doing the right things for this country, providing the right kind of environment for stable investment and lower deficits, leading to lower interest rates, lower inflation and, therefore, higher employment. These are the issues on which this government stands. I am happy to see this budget stand the test of time. When we see the economy growing more strongly, private investment up and more people in employment, we will look back to this period and see who was right about the long-term interests of this country and its economy.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr KEATING","NH4","BLAXLAND","ALP","N/A",947,"—In the last couple of days I have said a few things about the oppositions tactics in seeking to thwart the legitimate budget measures of the legitimate government of Australia in the House of Representatives—the government that beat it cold and by a mile just a few months ago. A couple of people in the press have woken up to the fact that for the last 10 years the government has not controlled the Senate but, because it had won in the House of Representatives, coalition senators and others passed the core of the money measures. I made the point in this House last year that Labor would pass the money measures of a coalition government, including the GST, in the Senate. A few other people talking about the same subject have noticed exactly the same point.It is not as if the revenue share in GDP were rocketing as a result of these measures and the real incidence of tax were rising. The revenue to GDP this year is a decimal point below that of last year—with the proposed tax increases. Over the next couple of years it will come back to be no higher than that of the last couple of years, nowhere like the early 1980s or the late 1980s. On that basis and without any defence, the opposition is trying in an opportunist way to knock over the governments budget measures in the Senate.I have been enjoined by the opposition to quote Gerard Henderson this morning. His column is headed `Senate opportunists cock a leg at governance. That is the best bit of subbing the Sydney Morning Herald has done in about three months. In the last paragraph, Mr Henderson says:In its current plight, with commodity prices at mid-1980s levels, Australia simply cannot afford post-Budget mayhem and long-term Senate paralysis.That is exactly right. It is a rational, sensible and decent statement. He also says:The alternative introduces American-type Senate paralysis into the Australian political process. It also has the unintended consequence of projecting minor parties and Independents into the very core of the governmental process.This is true. He also says:Yet another Coalition Opposition has denied the legitimacy of an elected Labor government. This is in part a reflection of the after-shock of losing the unlosable election.This is a serious but irresponsible stance taken by the opposition in the Senate to block the budget measures, to bring the budget deficit down. The Leader of the Opposition would have no trouble turning up at a business lunch or dinner and marketing himself as somebody who believes in good fiscal policy, when he is doing a job of vandalism on the Senate.What he succeeded in doing in the last election was marginalising the Liberal and National parties in the Senate. He has let the Australian Democrats find themselves a position in the budget process. In the last election it suited the Labor Party to have the sharpest ideological difference between the parties so that in the contest for ideas we marginalised the minor parties. As a consequence, the Labor primary vote shot up and only with that primary vote were we able to win the election. Were we relying on minor parties, the Democrats and others, that would not have been so. But the sheer brutality of the proposals put by the opposition at the time allowed the government to make that sharp distinction.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

In the last few days we have seen high profit reports by several companies—Woolworths, Coles Myer, News Ltd, Normandy Poseidon, amongst others. Company profits are just below their 1989 peak. The current level of the all ordinaries index is 1,964—as close as we have been to the post-1987 crash high of just over 2,300.The all ordinaries index is up 25 per cent since the beginning of this year. We are seeing all of these things starting to come through. The strength is coming through in profit; the strength is coming through in the economy. What the economy needs now like a hole in the head is shenanigans in the Senate, with senators trying to knock over a budget which will actually bring the budget deficit down in the middle of the 1990s—where we need it for national savings reasons—and for what legitimate reason proposed by the Leader of the Opposition? It is for no other reason than what Mr Henderson described as the Leader of the Oppositions:. . . rambling and retrospective address-in-reply to the Budget. Dr Hewson gave no indication of what kind of budget a GST-less Coalition would bring down. He contented himself with declaring unequivocal opposition to most of the Governments taxation measures.Does that not say it all—a rambling, retrospective address-in-reply which gave no indication of where the budget of a GST-less coalition would go, with the Leader of the Opposition contenting himself with just opposition.

This budget is about ensuring that those prospects are in fact achieved and not squandered, as would be the case if the Leader of the Opposition had his way and said, `To hell with the budget deficit; lets have it $3 billion higher than the government proposes four years from now.I was interested in the reference by the Leader of the Opposition to management and his reference, once again, to the exchange rate. The other day he entered into an argument with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The governor was making his views known about what it was that was affecting the fragility of the exchange rate. The governor said a couple of times that the financial communitys response to the budget and its contents was very favourable. What the financial markets have become disturbed about are the tactics of the opposition in not passing what they consider to be a good budget—a budget which is good for Australia.In response to the governors remarks, the Leader of the Opposition said, `Bernies making a judgment, and I am making a judgment. In other words, he was saying that we have to test the governors judgment against his judgment. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of his judgment in relation to who he thought would be good candidates for the governorship of the Reserve Bank. Remember his two prize candidates for governor of the Reserve Bank. One was Tim Marcus Clark, who ran the State Bank of South Australia; the other was Bill Moyle, who ran the State Bank of Victoria. The Leader of the Opposition says, `Lets put my judgment against that of Bernies. Let us go one step further. A few years ago the Leader of the Opposition was generally denigrating Australian management but trying to identify some of the stars in the management constellation in Australia, and in an article he said:Nevertheless, there are signs that things may be changing. They indicate that a managerial revolution is under way.This revolution has manifested itself in the emergence of a new breed of industrial managers. Names such as Skase, Bond, Elliott, Spalvins . . .He also said:The superior managerial skills of this new breed are readily apparent.He went on to say:Their attitudes are also different.Anyone who watched Four Corners last night might believe that Mr Skases attitudes are a bit different to what would be normally accepted as decent behaviour in Australia; yet he is one of the people the Leader of the Opposition wants to hold up as a paragon of managerial brilliance here in Australia.I am happy to put my judgment against that of the Leader of the Opposition on questions of how to run the economy. I am certainly prepared to put our management against his views of management on how this economy should be run as well.

Of course, we all recollect—we had a debate about it in this chamber—that we were subject to the blandishments of various Senate spokesmen on the box a couple of weeks ago when they were lecturing us on our dilatoriness, allegedly, in getting material to them in sufficient time for them to give it due consideration. They were supported, of course, in their shenanigans by the opposition in this chamber which joined in that thumping hypocrisy in the arguments that were presented here.Let us have a look at the progress made to date. There have been eight sitting days so far in this chamber. In this chamber, 11 bills have passed in that time, 16 bills have been introduced which are yet to be fully debated, and I am told that 10 bills are to be introduced this afternoon. That is not a bad record of passage for any government at any point of time, and at the beginning of a session it is not bad at all.Until midday yesterday, what did we have in the Senate? The Senate had sat for some 44 hours. The amount of time devoted to government legislation was 55 minutes. Those 55 minutes produced from the Senate a bill which had been introduced on 27 May. It was taken to the conclusion of the second reading when it was then departed from for consideration of other things that the Senate likes to have a chat about. Those other things included a report to the Senate from one of its committees which, after 2 1/2 hours debate, was sent back to the committee. That was something that the Senate felt was worth while doing. Then it decided it would have a bit of a look at a few other things; so it devoted 53 per cent of its time to general business and some five per cent of its time to MPIs.For example, this afternoon the Senate has got from this House a series of bills on excise and sales tax matters. One would think it would be an ample opportunity for it to debate those issues. But, rather than getting around to debating those issues, what did it do? It had a two-hour MPI on petrol excise. So, rather than actually getting around to discussing the governments legislation on petrol excise where one would think it would be able to make a point or two, if it felt it had a point or two to make on it, the Senate would rather rock on for a couple of hours with an MPI. What we have from the Senate here is further evidence of what the Prime Minister alluded to in his remarks when this issue was debated before.

So all that sort of hypocrisy we have had from the opposition in this area needs to be exposed for what it is: it is simply yet another aspect of the disruptive tactics that it has pursued, smarting from its electoral defeat earlier this year.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

But as they would have noticed, Mr Rose from the Attorney-Generals Department has provided an opinion to the Senate—the same in almost identical terms, as far as I know, as the one he provided to the government—in which he said that it was not unconstitutional to present taxation legislation in this way. I know that over the years there have been many cases where omnibus bills have included a number of taxation measures at the time.I think what the honourable member must reflect upon is why it is that the opposition finds this such an uncomfortable prospect. Why is it that the opposition finds it so difficult to deal with this collection of measures? The reason, of course, is that this is a package of measures which is about reducing the size of the deficit over the years, which delivers tax cuts particularly to those people who are in the lower and medium income bracket and which extends a new income tax rebate to lower income groups.Apparently the opposition wants to vote down these measures. The opposition does not want to support tax cuts for people who are on middle incomes. Therefore, the opposition wants to be able to take its pick of these particular measures.But, as far as the government is concerned and as far as the integrity of the governments deficit reduction strategy is concerned, all of these measures will be put to the Senate at one time and that is an entirely sensible thing for us to do. Indeed, the Prime Minister reminded us just the other day of how the Leader of the Opposition had intended to employ just such a strategy if he had won the election. He was proposing to put a package of measures to the Senate on a take it or leave it basis. The difficulty for the opposition is that this, similarly, is a package of measures. It is a package of measures designed to reduce the deficit. In that sense, it is an entirely responsible thing for us to be doing. In the end, the honourable member and his colleagues have to decide whether they will be responsible or simply continue with the irresponsibility which is being orchestrated by their leader.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

41,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr DAWKINS","9E4","FREMANTLE","ALP","N/A",952,"—I have, of course, noticed some of the arguments which have been put forward in the context of the governments decision to increase the sales tax on wine. While some of the arguments have flowed around the question of equity and the desirability of making more equal the treatment of wine versus other alcoholic drinks—rather than, say, wine versus lemonade; Grange Hermitage is now taxed at the same level as lemonade—there is a powerful argument to say that there ought to be a greater equity between wine and some of the other beverages with which it competes.On this question of exports, the arguments are particularly spurious. The wholesale sales tax is a tax on domestic wine; it is not imposed on wine sold overseas. Not $1 is imposed on exports of Australian wine. Indeed, overseas visitors wishing to take home Australian wine would not pay the wholesale sales tax on wine they bought in Australia.The industry appears to be saying—and it should be very wary about how it puts this argument—that there is only one case in which this could be true, as Mr Gittins pointed out in the newspaper the other day. Mr Gittins talks about the one possible way the wine lobbyists could sustain their argument that higher taxation of domestic sales will impair their wine exports. He goes on to say:If thats true, it means local wine drinkers are subsidising the industrys exports. It needs buoyant local sales to cover its fixed costs because it can only sell wine abroad at prices that are less than the average cost of producing the wine.This is a very dangerous argument for the wine industry to be putting about, because it is an argument which it cannot run here in Australia without some overseas competitors understanding the force of what the industry is actually saying. The industry runs the risk of exposing itself to anti-dumping action from foreign competitors because a case can be mounted where a goods export price is below its normal value—normal value being defined as a domestic price for an equivalent product under equivalent conditions of sale.So the industry, either consciously or unconsciously, is giving a weapon to its competitors in California and Europe to beat it around the head with if this is a true argument. I do not believe it is a true argument. I believe this is an entirely spurious argument, but if the industry keeps putting it then some people might believe it and some of those who believe it may well be its international competitors.In the budget speech I said that the government was committed to retaining the exclusion of wine from excise. That commitment to maintaining a taxation regime for wine which is concessional vis-a-vis taxation of beer and spirits was conditional on the WST on wine being increased from the previously highly concessional level. Those campaigning against the WST increase on wine should be aware that one consequence of their campaign, if it happened to be successful, would be the negation of the governments commitment to retaining the exclusion of wine from excise duty.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

45,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr FREE","HG4","LINDSAY","ALP","N/A",953,"—I thank the honourable member for her question. I can inform her that the government has a well-planned strategy in place to ensure that students understand that the options for job generating study after they leave school are much wider than just attending university.On the weekend, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced research by ANOP which showed that nearly 70 per cent of year 12 students want to go on to university. Whether it comes from watching too many episodes of LA Law or GP , it appears that too many kids assume that a university education in law or medicine is the only pathway to a good job.That is a belief that the government is anxious to correct. We need to convince the kids that TAFE and training are the best hope for the vast majority of them to build a basis for a career. The ANOP poll showed that 56 per cent of senior school students hoped to become white collar professionals, but this group only accounts for 14 per cent of the work force.The need to expand the TAFE system is obvious. The practical skills of TAFE teachers are directly linked to job generating economic growth. A structurally sound economy requires a balance between graduates from the universities and the TAFE system.To encourage young people to consider the options that TAFE and training can provide, the government is implementing a long-term campaign to demonstrate that there is more to post-school learning than universities. A national TV campaign will commence next week, targeted at encouraging school leavers to consider TAFE and training rather than just assuming that if they do not go on to university they will be on the scrap heap. The campaign has one simple but very important message: that in a tough employment market, training is the best way to get a foot in the door.The governments strategy to convince young people that good jobs depend on post-school training is already yielding dividends. New figures from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research show that the participation rate of young people in TAFE in 1992 grew by four per cent over the preceding year. That improvement is very gratifying. It demonstrates that we are beginning to see a cultural change which recognises that when it comes to young people choosing an education and career options it is a matter of horses for courses.However, we need to continue to encourage kids to use training to get their foot in the door and that crucial first job. We need to convince young people, their families and their teachers that the TAFE and training pathway is just as useful as university and that there is nothing intrinsically superior about having a degree.Australians have traditionally recognised the skills of men and women who are good at what they do for a living, regardless of where they learnt their crafts. It is a tradition that this government will do everything it can to foster because, whether someone is a graduate from Melbourne University or from Moorabbin TAFE, it is what they know, not where they learnt it, that really counts.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Let me assure him that in fact manufacturing exports from the automotive sector were up 20 per cent in the six months ending June 1993. As a component of that, there was a 48 per cent increase in completely built up units. That says something about which we as a nation ought to be very proud. Certainly the industry deserves credit for getting to that point. There were significant rises in two markets in our region. For example, there was a 29 per cent increase for Japan and a 134 per cent increase for Korea, and there are very strong prospects indeed for further diversification and growth in those areas.Additionally, 65 component manufacturers are exporting to markets throughout the world. I have been provided with a document by the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers. I will not go into the detail of that document, but it is compelling. I think that for anyone in this House who wants to gain some idea of the growth, the creativity and the drive of this sector of the Australian economy, it ought to be compulsory reading. Given that it has been provided on an in confidence basis, I intend to seek the permission of that organisation to doctor it, if you like, in order to remove the commercial-in-confidence or confidential aspects and to give honourable members an opportunity to see what is happening. As a rough thumbnail sketch, companies are exporting to almost every country in the world, and are exporting products at the leading edge of world technologies. There is growth in their markets and an increasing acceptance of the ability of Australians to not only meet but also beat the best in the world.Opposed to the governments policies we have the oppositions miserable policies of zero tariffs. I note that the honourable member for Forrest has in the recent past distanced himself in policy terms—if not in physical terms—from his colleague sitting next to him in the House who still ardently supports a zero tariff outcome. The honourable member for Mayo does not know whether he is Arthur or Martha on this one, but promises to put a view in the not too distant future. There are significant issues for the opposition to address in this area. I am waiting with bated breath and with some enthusiasm for them to put down some signpost to the future so that we can get a decent debate going once again in relation to this important sector of Australian industry.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

The fact is that not every hospital reports injuries to the National Injury Surveillance Unit, so the number of injuries could be much larger than that. So there has been a call from the New South Wales government for perhaps more stringent labelling and an education campaign.It seems to me that we may even have to look at banning this product, so I have asked for an urgent inquiry.

In yesterdays Notice Paper you would have observed that 38 questions still remain unanswered from the month of May—that is over two months ago. In the interests of fairness, to improve the opportunity for members to properly represent their constituents and to provide them with the opportunity to question the government on its administration—particularly on its spending of their tax money—do you agree that, because of the failure of ministers to answer questions on notice in a reasonable amount of time, the standing orders ought to be amended to provide for a time limit within which answers should be provided by ministers? Do you agree that, as one of the forms of this House, questions on notice ought to allow for reasonably swift responses from the ministers responsible for spending taxpayers money?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[16]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

85,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"Mr SPEAKER",10000,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—Order! Yesterday, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) asked me a question about seating on the floor of the House of Representatives for senators and distinguished visitors. His question followed the decision made by the Senate on 18 May 1993 to provide chairs on the floor of the Senate for visiting members of the House of Representatives and its request that the House of Representatives should provide similar seating in the House of Representatives chamber.The question of seating for senators and visitors on the floor of the House of Representatives chamber has received consideration on a number of occasions. In 1970 the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House argued strongly against any such seating on the floor of the chamber, citing the arrangements in London, Ottawa and Washington. The approved design for the chamber excluded such seating and a 1986 proposal to provide seating was rejected by the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House. The matter was raised again after occupation of the building and again rejected.Any seating provided at the back of the House of Representatives chamber would provide poor sightlines for much of the chamber, especially the table area. I also think the location would compare quite unfavourably with the seating provided for senators where there is easy access by way of the lifts outside the House of Representatives and Senate chambers and a Senate division-quorum light has been installed for the convenience of senators.Finally, events of 1991 involving a senator in the senators reserved seating area of the gallery have been ingrained indelibly in my mind and, in my view, militate against the proposal.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[1]/proctext/interject[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr WILLIS","ZJ4","(Gellibrand-","ALP","Minister for Finance)",960,"—I move:That the bill be now read a second time.The sale of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd represents another important step in the governments micro-economic reform program. The corporation was formed in 1970 to build and capitalise on the engineering expertise which had been acquired from all over the world during the construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme. At the same time, the formation of SMEC reduced the need to use foreign consultants in Australia and provided a source of income through opening of overseas markets for Australian consultants.On 1 July 1989 the corporation reached another important milestone when it was converted into a full public company. Since then SMEC has conducted itself in the same manner as any other private sector company. This has included the benefits of full operational autonomy and also taking on the responsibility for debts and liabilities associated with its operations. Throughout its distinguished history SMEC has `done us proud. It is highly regarded overseas and has built up an enviable reputation for engineering consulting through completing some 1,700 projects in 55 countries. It has now grown into a consulting organisation of international standing in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering.But everything has its time and place and while it once may have been appropriate for the Australian government to foster the development of engineering consulting skills through ownership of a consultancy company, this is now no longer the case. The rapid development of the Australian consulting engineering industry over the past 25 years and its internationally recognised capability has meant that there is now no reason to maintain SMEC in public ownership. Although for the first 10 years of operations SMEC enjoyed financial success, in the early 1980s it was severely affected by the downturn in the international engineering consulting industry. After five years of losses SMEC returned to profit in 1987 but its performance was at best still only marginal.In the year ending 30 June 1992, after significant restructuring and refocussing of its marketing efforts, it turned the corner and returned a pre-tax profit of more than $1 million before abnormals. Because of redundancies and other abnormals, SMECs consolidated after tax result was a profit of $314,000. In the year ending 30 June 1993 SMECs consolidated after tax result is expected to improve further to a healthy profit of more than $1 million. On behalf of the government I wish to extend my congratulations to the board, management and staff of SMEC for this excellent result.A pre-sale scoping study undertaken for the task force on asset sales by Arthur Andersen indicates that SMECs consultancy business is well placed to continue to prosper and return profits. As with any service organisation, SMECs resources are its skilled staff and the recent and future success of the organisation rests with those staff.The government has accordingly given first preference to staff to purchase the company. They made it what it is today, they built it up, they returned it to profit and the government believes that SMECs staff should be allowed to enjoy the fruits of its success. It is the governments intention to sell SMEC to Tinbury Ltd, a company formed by SMEC staff specifically for the purpose of purchasing SMEC, provided that Tinbury pays a fair price and demonstrates it has the wherewithal to give SMEC a sustainable and viable future.The government is ensuring that a sales agreement with Tinbury addresses issues relevant to the staff of SMEC; specifically, that: Tinbury Ltd will maintain the headquarters of SMEC in Cooma and not sell SMEC for a period of at least five years, and all SMEC staff will have a further opportunity to purchase shares in Tinbury Ltd before a sale is completed. Because the staff and key managers of SMEC have a much greater knowledge of the company than the Commonwealth as shareholder, the government is offering no warranties to Tinbury Ltd post-sale except as to matters of corporate structure, ownership, title and the power to transfer them.The government as shareholder has no legal liability for SMECs debts and this position is, of course, unchanged by the sale of the governments shareholding. Other than in respect of proper payment of pre-sale Australian taxation, there is and will be no government indemnity to SMEC of any kind post-sale.However, in recognition of the possible contingent liability in respect of a 1990 incident at the Dartmouth Dam power station, which is noted in SMECs annual report, the government is providing a limited money back guarantee to Tinbury. This means that in the unfortunate event that SMEC were to be forced into liquidation as a result of the Dartmouth litigation, Tinbury would get a refund of the money it had paid up-front to the Commonwealth from Tinburys share capital or borrowings as part of the sale.The bill now before the House contains the legislative changes that need to be made to enable the sale of SMEC to be finalised while taking into account a range of possible sale outcomes. This is to cover the possibility that an agreement with Tinbury which is acceptable to the government does not eventuate or a sale to Tinbury is not completed. Much of the bill is concerned with the removal of SMEC from the ambit of Commonwealth legislation so that, post-sale, SMEC will face the same treatment as any other engineering consulting organisation.During the period of SMECs financial downturn it accumulated taxation losses. These losses are of value to a potential purchaser because they could reduce tax paid to the Commonwealth on future SMEC profits. In order to reduce the initial cash cost of purchasing SMEC, should it be sold to staff, the bill contains a provision for the extinguishing of these losses. This means that future SMEC profits, for the financial year in which the sale occurs onwards, will be fully taxable as if no past losses had been made. These taxation provisions will be proclaimed only if forming an essential part of the purchase price agreed in a sale contract.The governments primary aim in the sale of its shares in SMEC is that employees continue to have secure and rewarding jobs and earn foreign exchange for Australia as SMEC increases its international success, particularly in the dynamic Asia-Pacific region. The government is also committed to the protection up to point of sale of SMEC employees entitlements which accrued during the period of government ownership, especially in cases where these entitlements accrued as a result of Commonwealth legislation.To this end the bill provides for a number of `saving provisions in respect of a variety of acts, such as the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. These provisions are similar to those in the Qantas Sale Act and will ensure that employees of SMEC do not lose the benefits that they will have accrued prior to sale. Rights under the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act will continue to apply to those employees who commence leave within 12 months of a sale or are on leave at the time of sale.Regulations will be separately introduced under the Superannuation Act 1976 to ensure that employees of SMEC who are currently members of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme do not lose the superannuation benefits that they will have accrued under this scheme prior to the sale. In general, other rights not conferred by Commonwealth legislation will not be affected by the sale as the government is selling its shares in SMEC and the SMEC award with its current conditions will continue post-sale.As soon as possible after a sales agreement is finalised, a date for sale completion will be set on which SMEC is to be freed from all legislative constraints which apply generally to Commonwealth business enterprises. The bill also contains a provision exempting the transaction from state and territory taxes as well as other saving and transitional provisions relating to other Commonwealth acts.This bill puts in place a sound legislative framework to enable the sale of SMEC to be completed once an acceptable sale agreement has been struck. It will free SMEC from Commonwealth constraints other than those of a normal company and allow SMEC to take charge of its own growth and destiny. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill.Debate (on motion by Mr Cobb ) adjourned.","N/A","SNOWY MOUNTAINS ENGINEERING CORPORATION LIMITED SALE BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The National Registration Authoritys operations in respect of the clearance of chemical products are to be open and transparent and seen to be such. Similar provisions will also be included in the package of registration bills to be introduced shortly and proposed to commence operation in July 1994.The publics involvement will be facilitated by the National Registration Authority releasing a summary of its evaluation of a chemical product before making a determination. Also, the NRA will be able to seek the advice of certain organisations or persons by releasing confidential commercial information to assist in its evaluation of applications. However, precautions will be taken to ensure that trade secrets and certain information subject to possible commercial exploitation are safeguarded.The National Registration Authority will be able to conduct public and private hearings for the purpose of obtaining comment on chemical products and will be required to notify the times and places for such hearings in daily newspapers throughout Australia. Directors and staff of the National Registration Authority are exempt from suit in respect of the granting or refusal of clearance of a chemical product. These amendments will extend that exemption to the National Registration Authority itself. The amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 will enable the National Registration Authority to issue receipts in a more efficient manner and will enable the NRA to determine progressively conditions of service for staff transferred from the Public Service.The government has a commitment to remove all forms of discrimination in the formulation and administration of government policies and programs. One part of that commitment is removing the 65-year age limit which was imposed in many areas of public activity. The amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 will remove the maximum age limits for members and executive directors of these bodies to ensure that the best available people can be appointed to positions in the corporations.The governments decisions on a national ecologically sustainable development strategy require the incorporation of ESD principles and priorities into the normal activities of government decision making and administration. Within the primary industries and energy portfolio, that incorporation process involves—the inclusion in enabling legislation of objectives focusing on ecologically sustainable development for research and development corporations;ensuring that expertise in ecosystems management and conservation, as well as economic and social factors, are taken into account when people are selected to serve on corporation boards; andrequiring these bodies to take ESD principles into account in determining priorities for allocation of funds; to report ESD related research, development and demonstration in annual reports and to report progress in achieving all of the corporations objectives, including the new ESD objectives.The Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 already makes provisions for the board to have expertise in environmental and social factors. The amendments in this bill implement the other components of the governments strategy for the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987, the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 will achieve these objectives.The amendment to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 will remove any uncertainty about the operation of the arrangements under which manufacturers of exported dairy products currently receive market support payments which are financed by a levy on all milk production. On behalf of the Commonwealth the Australian Dairy Corporation administers the market support scheme which includes what is known as an `import offset arrangement.Under the arrangement recipients of market support payments must declare purchases of imported dairy products. When these are `like products to a firms exports, the firm is liable to pay the corporation an amount equal to the market support payment on an equivalent volume of exports. In effect, payments are made on net exports rather than total exports. The purpose of the import offset arrangement is to prevent companies from receiving market support payments on exported product—which would otherwise have been sold on the domestic market—and then importing the same type of product for domestic sale. If the arrangement is not enforceable, the Australian Dairy Corporation would be required to make payments on the gap between net and total exports, that is, for the volume of imports, and in recent years the effectiveness of the market support scheme would have been reduced by between $1 million and $2 million each year.Because of uncertainty concerning the basis of the import offset arrangement the corporation has not applied the arrangement for the last two seasons. This legislation removes any uncertainty and allows the corporation to proceed to apply the arrangement for 1991-92, 1992-93 and the remainder of the life of the market support scheme.The International Dairy Federations world congress will provide Australian dairy producers with increased exposure to international technological developments, and allow them to develop closer working relationships with those at the forefront of the world dairy industry. Australian industry will have the opportunity to demonstrate that it is efficient and that there are positive effects from this governments policy of reducing both assistance and trade distortions.The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has agreed to allow the industry to use the dairy industry fund to underwrite the world congress. The fund is presently used for Australian contributions to the International Dairy Federation, the organisation under whose auspices the World Dairy Congress is held. This bill includes an amendment of the Dairy Produce Act 1986 to enable the use of the industry fund to underwrite the Australian hosting of the 1994 congress.There is a longstanding agreement between government and industry that $1 million would be made available to underwrite the congress. It is expected that significant income will be obtained from sponsorships and other sources and that expenditure from the dairy industry fund will eventually be reimbursed from congresss proceeds.The amendment to the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Amendments) Act 1991 extends the period during which part IVA of the Fisheries Act 1952 continues in force. Part IVA enables the Commonwealth to enter into arrangements with the states and Northern Territory to vary the jurisdictional arrangements for identified fisheries in accordance with the offshore constitutional settlement. These provisions are complemented by state and Northern Territory legislation. Similar powers have been included in the new Fisheries Management Act 1991 but these provisions cannot commence until state and territory legislation has been amended.Initial expectations were that these changes would be finalised by 3 February 1994. I regret to say that this timetable has not been achieved. The amendments will extend the operation of part IVA for an additional 12-month period to enable the necessary state and territory legislation to be put in place. Part IVA of the Fisheries Act 1952 will be repealed when all complementary state and territory legislation is in place.The amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 reflect the original intention that seasonal and other closures may be authorised under a management plan and provide greater flexibility in the type and number of fishing concessions a fisherman may hold.The Fisheries Management Act 1991 which commenced on 3 February 1992 provided the new Australian Fisheries Management Authority—AFMA—with a firm foundation to undertake the Commonwealths fisheries management responsibilities. In particular the act established a new system of statutory fishing rights and provided for the making of fishery management plans to be the primary instrument for managing Australias commercial fisheries.The act provides general powers for AFMA to make management plans and create and issue various types of fishing concessions. The success of this approach relies on the certainty that management plans, rights issued in accordance with those plans, and any other action taken under a plan are fully supported by the law.Recent legal advice indicates that the provisions of the act may not fully support the level of flexibility needed to implement some fishery management arrangements. Rather than leave the issue uncertain and open to different interpretations, these amendments put beyond doubt the matters that may be included in a plan.Statutory fishing rights were created to give greater security to fishermen. For fishermen to have confidence in the arrangements there must be unambiguous provisions to support the issue and holding of the widest range of statutory fishing rights that may be required under a plan. Provision is made for a fisherman to hold a number of statutory fishing rights as a discrete package of rights which authorises a particular fishing activity. Examples are combinations of quotas to take various species of fish or specified combinations of fishing gear or boat characteristics such as size or engine power. Provision is also made for the smooth transition to the new act of existing fishing rights in fisheries subject to management plans.The amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 are consequential to the establishment of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation and the related forest industries research levy and charge acts.The amendments reflect changed funding arrangements for the corporation of $1 Commonwealth for every $2 from industry rather than the $1 for $1 currently provided in the act. The basis of the changed funding arrangements for the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation arises from the structure of the industry—half the industry has a primary industry focus, while the other half has a manufacturing orientation. Commonwealth funding is intended to match the rural half of the industry contribution, consistent with arrangements for research and development in other rural industries.The amendments will also provide that revenue derived from charges under the Forest Industry Research Import Charge Act 1993 will be directed to research and development of relevance to the timber importing industry. The amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 will enable the forest industries levies and charges to be collected under the same arrangements which apply to the collection of other primary industries levies and charges.The bill also includes a minor amendment to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act 1949 to empower the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority to invest surplus funds in specified classes of securities without the need to obtain prior ministerial approval for each transaction. The amendment will avoid the delays which can occur while obtaining this approval and associated unnecessary losses. It furthers the governments objective of reducing controls over day-to-day operations as part of its wider government business enterprise reform to deliver best possible performance.The main amendment to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is to correct an anomaly in the act to ensure that it provides the necessary constitutional power for the states to confer functions on the Australian Wheat Board to allow it to conduct intrastate trade in grain and grain products. Changes are also being made to improve efficiencies in the operation of the Wheat Board.Doubts had been raised as to whether the Commonwealth act presently confers the necessary powers to enable the Wheat Board to conduct intrastate trade in any grains other than wheat even though state acts have purported to confer those powers since the commencement of the revised wheat marketing arrangements on 1 July 1989. In order to validate the Wheat Boards intrastate grain trading operations these amendments will be made retrospective to that date.The proposed amendments in other areas include provisions to allow the Wheat Board flexibility to make adjustments to pool return payments based on variety, quality, transport, storage and handling costs and other similar matters which are unable to be accurately specified in the delivery contract, so as to ensure that growers within a pool are treated fairly in respect of the wheat they deliver.This bill also corrects a number of minor operational deficiencies which have been identified by the Wheat Board as restricting its commercial and pooling operations. I commend the bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum.Debate (on motion by Mr Cobb ) adjourned.","N/A","PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

99,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LEE","MG4","(Dobell-","ALP","Minister for Resources and Minister for Tourism)",966,"—I move:That the bill be now read a second time.This bill forms part of a package of legislation to establish and fund a Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation in partnership with industry. The purpose of this bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on wood produced in Australia which is delivered to a mill for processing in order to fund the corporation. The corporation is to be established under the omnibus Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989.There are two other bills in this package which provide for: a charge on wood produced in Australia and exported from Australia as unprocessed wood; and a charge on unprocessed wood and certain classes of primary processed forest products imported into Australia. In addition, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Bill includes consequential amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989.The forest and wood products industry is of great significance to Australias economy, generating significant employment and economic activity. The industry employs around 40,000 people, mostly in regional communities of Australia where there are limited alternative employment opportunities.To date the focus of the Australian forest industry has largely been on the domestic market, where it has provided around two-thirds of our consumption needs. Exports of forest and timber products have largely been confined to lower value woodchips and wood products which have undergone minimal processing. On the other hand, Australia is a significant importer of higher value pulp and paper products. Imports totalled some $2,438 million in 1992-93, compared with exports of only some $775 million, resulting in a trade deficit of $1,663 million. This amounted to around 11 per cent of the current account deficit for last year.The government is strongly committed to building competitiveness and expanding productivity of Australian industry—particularly our primary industries, whose contribution to exports underpins the economy. The governments rural research policy is central to achieving this objective. The Commonwealth provides funding to encourage increased rural productivity and profitability through research and commercialisation of research findings.Already the Commonwealth provides significant support to forest industry research and development in several ways: through direct funding to CSIRO divisions of Forestry, Forest Products, and Wildlife and Ecology; to the cooperative research centres for temperate hardwood forestry and hardwood fibre and paper science; and through such programs as the national pulp mill research program and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporations agroforestry program. Research into forestry and forest products is also supported by the state governments and the forest industry. However, there is no doubt that there is a need for an improvement in our forest and wood products research and development effort. This need has long been recognised by the Australian Forestry Council and by the industry.In addition, all major reports on the forest industry, including the Resource Assessment Commissions 1992 forest and timber inquiry, the National Plantations Advisory Committee and the ESD working group on forest use, have echoed the urgent need for an enhanced, better coordinated and better focused research effort. This is essential if we are to increase productivity and value-adding processing in our forests and wood products industries and manage our forests in an ecologically sustainable manner.The message is clear. We need to increase the level of research and to ensure that the focus is on nationally important, strategic issues. This does not mean diverting current funding or duplicating existing work. We need to lift our game overall. The government has therefore agreed, as a key initiative under the national forest policy statement, to establish a Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation in partnership with industry. The corporation and its commissioned research will be funded from contributions from the Commonwealth and industry.Regulations have already been made establishing the corporation from 1 January 1994 under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. As with other rural research and development corporations, this corporation will have a high degree of industry involvement and accountability: it will not be just another arm of government. It will be set up as a body corporate with day-to-day autonomy and flexibility to operate in a manner similar to many commercial operations. Its purpose will be to provide national strategic leadership to industry research and development and act as a catalyst to stimulate research and development within industry.The corporation will identify national research priorities and assess research gaps. It will commission, administer and subsequently evaluate research into a broad range of areas relating to wood production, extraction, processing, economics and marketing. Its charter will also include the ecological and environmental impacts of disturbance resulting from wood production, silviculture and management of native forests and plantations. The corporation itself will not actually undertake any research. Organisations currently conducting forest industry research will be eligible to tender to carry out research on behalf of the corporation.Industry, through the National Association of Forest Industries, as the representative organisation, will be closely involved in the selection of a board of directors for the corporation. Procedures for selecting a board, which are established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, will ensure that the board includes a broad range of expertise enabling it to address the full range of issues included in the charter of the corporation. The corporation will be required to prepare five-year research and development plans in consultation with industry which will outline the objectives, strategies and policies it intends to pursue. It will also be required to prepare annual operating plans for each financial year, consistent with its five-year plan.The corporation will also be required to prepare annual reports which will be tabled in parliament and made available to industry for scrutiny. These will assess the corporations performance against the key elements identified in its strategic plans and contain sufficient information to enable industry to make a comprehensive assessment of the value of the research and development activities undertaken. The chairperson of the corporation will also be required to report directly to the executive of the National Association of Forest Industries on an annual basis and be prepared to be questioned on the activities of the corporation.I repeat that the Commonwealths intention in establishing the corporation is to supplement the existing research effort rather than to replace it. There is a firm expectation that the existing research effort by the industry, both by private companies and the public forest management agencies, will be maintained or enhanced.In order to raise sufficient funds to implement an effective research and development program under the corporation, the forest and wood products industry has asked the government to introduce a statutory levy on the domestic production of wood. The industry, including timber importers, has also requested a charge on imports of unprocessed wood and on certain classes of primary processed forest products, including sawn timber, wood based panels, medium density fibreboard and hardboard. I wish to emphasise that this is a charge on importers of wood and forest products, not on the exporters.The Australian Timber Importers Federation, an affiliate of the National Association of Forest Industries, has recently expressed strong support for such a charge, recognising that importers, who stand to benefit from the research, should also contribute. Of direct relevance to importers will be economic and marketing research, an area which will be specifically identified in the charter for the corporation. Importers will benefit directly from research and development into fields such as expanding the demand for wood products in Australia, new market and product developments, fire related codes and standards, and the use of timber in multiple storey construction.In order to ensure that imports are treated no less favourably than domestic production, the legislation provides that the charge on imports of unprocessed wood is to be set at the same rate as the levy on domestic production. The legislation also provides that a conversion factor between unprocessed wood and classes of processed wood, which has been agreed with industry, will be applied to the levy to determine a rate of charge for primary processed wood products imported into Australia. The conversion factors will ensure that equivalent rates apply between imports and domestic production. To ensure that importers benefit from the research activities undertaken by the corporation, the legislation provides explicitly that funds which have been raised from the charge on imports must be directed to research and development, which will be of relevance to the timber importing industry. I am assured that introduction of the levy is fully consistent with Australias obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Closer Economic Relations Agreement with New Zealand.The Commonwealth will provide $1 for every $2 provided from the domestic industry up to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of the gross value of production of the industry. The basis of the 1:2 funding arrangement arises from the structure of the forest related industry. Half of the industry has a primary industry focus on tree production and small rural sawmills, while the other half has a manufacturing orientation. Commonwealth funding is intended to match the rural half of the industry contribution, consistent with arrangements for research and development in other rural industries. This is also in recognition that the Commonwealth already provides significant support to the other sectors of industry through other research programs. However, the Commonwealth will not match funds raised from the import charge.Operative rates of the levy and charges to be contributed by industry will be set by regulation on the basis of advice from industry. Under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act (1989), before the Minister for Resources makes any recommendation to the Governor-General on the operative rate of levy or to the classes of leviable products or changes to these, the minister is required to take into consideration any relevant advice from any prescribed organisation. In this case, that is the National Association of Forest Industries.Industry is still consulting on the operative rate at which the levy and charges are to be introduced. The legislation sets a maximum rate for a class of wood of 0.5 per cent of its average value to ensure that no one sector of the forest industry bears a significantly greater responsibility for industry contributions than others and, indeed, that the industry overall is not levied excessively. I have been advised by the National Association of Forest Industries that it expects to recommend a rate lower than this for some sectors. For every 0.1 per cent the rate would be in the order of 4c and 6c per cubic metre of unprocessed wood.It will be up to industry to decide whether the revenue raised by the levy and charges, together with the Commonwealths contribution, is providing the corporation with the resources to increase the research effort to the appropriate level. The Commonwealth will, in a sense, be acting as the agent of industry to ensure that the levy and charges are applied in a comprehensive and equitable way. The levies and charges will be collected in accordance with the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. These, together with the Commonwealth contribution, will be paid into a separate account under the administration of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation.This particular bill relates to the imposition of a levy on unprocessed wood which is delivered to a mill. It will take effect from 1 January 1994. The bill provides that different levy rates may apply to different classes of wood. The levy will be payable by the operator of the mill to which the wood is delivered. Industry has requested that different rates of levy apply to four classes of wood—hardwood sawlogs, softwood sawlogs, hardwood pulplogs, and softwood pulplogs. These will be based on the average value for that class of wood. In the case of unprocessed wood, which is produced in Australia and exported, a charge at the same rates as the levies imposed by this bill will be imposed by the Forest Industries Research Export Charge Bill (1993) when the wood is exported. Industry has also requested that provision be made for flexibility of levy rates within the forest sectors. The bill provides for this.Contributions from the domestic industry are expected to raise around $180,000 in the last six months of 1993-94, rising to $700,000 in 1994-95. In providing funding for the corporation, the Commonwealth will outlay about $90,000 in 1993-94 and around $350,000 in 1994-95. The Commonwealth has committed a total of $4.25 million for the period up to 1995-96, after which a review will be held with industry on the effectiveness of the corporation.I am pleased to be able to bring these bills before the House. They mark an important new phase in forest industry research and development, which will enable existing research activities to be better focused and coordinated. The establishment of the corporation will be a sound investment in the future of the industry and should lead to significant advances in forest production and our ability to add value to our forest products. This, in turn, will help to build competitiveness both internationally as well as with other materials and to expand the productive capacity of our forest industries. At the same time, it will also provide a sound framework for achieving the objectives of the national forest policy statement for research and development. I commend the bill to honourable members, and I present the explanatory memorandum to the bills.Debate (on motion by Mr Cobb ) adjourned.","N/A","FOREST INDUSTRIES RESEARCH LEVY BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

105,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr FREE","HG4","(Lindsay-","ALP","Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training)",970,"—I move:That the bill be now read a second time.This bill makes some minor amendments to the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 to insert a new provision in relation to the transfer of certain programs from the Commonwealth to the authority and to correct an unrelated drafting oversight in the act. The Australian National Training Authority was established formally in December 1992 following an agreement between heads of government in July of that year. The planning and funding arrangements for the new national vocational education and training system, outlined in the agreement, come into full effect from the beginning of 1994.As part of the new arrangements, the authority will assume responsibility for administering certain Commonwealth programs, currently administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which `support training activities and services which are national in scope and purpose.The Commonwealth-state ministerial council which oversees the authority agreed, in April this year, on the programs to be transferred to the authority. These `national programs provide catalytic and ongoing support for implementation of key aspects of the national training reform agenda. They include measures to support the development of industry relevant, nationally consistent competency based training; to encourage involvement of the industry parties in the planning and provision of national vocational education and training; and to improve access and equity in our training system.The ministerial council also agreed that, as the transfer of programs will take place midway through the financial year, the authority should take over responsibility for current grants as well as uncommitted funds. To give effect to the councils decision it will be necessary to transfer to the authority responsibility for relevant agreements which the Commonwealth has entered into with grant recipients.This bill provides a simple mechanism for the transfer, which will result in minimum disruption to program clients. Under the new provision, the minister or his delegate may declare that a specified agreement is to become the responsibility of the authority. Once the declaration comes into effect, the authority replaces the Commonwealth as a party to the agreement. The declaration cannot take effect until a copy is given to the other party to the agreement.The financial impact of this bill is minor. There will be some administrative costs involved in processing declarations made under the new provision, and transferring relevant documentation from the department to the authority. However, the mechanism provided by the bill is expected to be more cost effective than the alternative of renegotiating or varying a large number of individual agreements.The bill also corrects a drafting oversight in the act by providing that the definition of `year in the act does not apply to section 27. The definition of `year as `a calendar year beginning on or after 1 January 1994 was clearly not intended to apply to this section, which provides for members of the authority to be appointed for a period of up to three years. The purpose of legislating to create the authority in late 1992 was to permit it to undertake the planning necessary for full implementation of the new arrangements in 1994. The members were, in fact, appointed shortly after the act received royal assent in December 1992.The amendments which I have outlined will allow for the Australian National Training Authority to assume responsibility for national programs and related agreements from 1 January 1994. The authority, with these and other important responsibilities, will play a key role in the development of a more effective national vocational education and training system for the benefit of all Australians.

Most of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. I will briefly outline the amendments. Sections 3 to 10, 13 to 17 and subsection 12(2) of this bill contain amendments which will remove from the principal act references to schedule 5. This schedule contains the legislative means to administer quota restrictions on imported goods. As quota restrictions on textiles, clothing and footwear were abolished on 1 March 1993 and the administration of cheese and curd quotas has been transferred to schedule 4 by this bill, there is no requirement for the subject legislation. These changes will operate on and from 14 days after this bill receives royal assent.The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, which will be introduced during these sittings, will amend the provisions governing the rules of origin for imported goods in the Customs Act 1901. Section 11 of this bill provides a consequential amendment to section 18 of the principal act to cater for the changes to the rules of origin. This amendment will operate from the day that the new provisions take effect.Subsection 12(1) and schedule 6 of this bill will operate on and from 1 July 1993. These changes give effect to the governments decision to reduce the coverage of the Australian system of tariff preferences, ASTP. This decision applies to chemicals, plastics, rubber and leather goods, sugar, textiles, clothing, footwear, fruit juice, canned food and dried fruit from countries listed in schedule 1 to the Customs Tariff Act, except forum island countries and 51 countries and places identified by the United Nations as being least developed.The list of countries affected by the change is shown in section 12(1) of this bill. The developing country rates of duty for these goods have been fixed at the pre-1 July 1993 level until the general rate falls to that level. Thereafter the general rate of duty will apply.Schedule 1 of this bill is operative on and from 1 January 1988 and provides a free rate of duty for needlecraft kits of heading 6308. Schedule 3 was operative between 13 October 1992 and 28 February 1993. It provided for the continued duty free importation of certain handkerchiefs under a concessional item in schedule 4 to the principal act. This provision was a short term measure, bridging similar concessions accorded by the tariff concession system prior to 13 October 1992 and the customs by-law system after 1 March 1993.Schedule 4 of this bill is operative on and from 1 March 1993. The Canadian margin of preference on certain carpets is being phased out following agreement between the Australian and Canadian governments. The Canadian rates of duty for these goods have been frozen at the pre-1 March 1993 level until the general rate falls to that level. Thereafter the general rate will apply.Also, this schedule contains amendments to implement changes to the concessional arrangements for textiles, clothing and footwear in schedule 4 to the principal act. This follows an inquiry into the efficacy of the customs by-law system in relation to TCF goods.Schedule 5 contains amendments to recognise the newly created independent countries of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. These changes accord the benefits of the Australian system of tariff preferences to the new countries and have effect from 10 March 1993.Schedule 6 is operative on and from 1 July 1993. The 1991 industry statement contained initiatives to assist local manufacturers of passenger motor vehicle components. These government initiatives exclude certain goods of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles and which had a rate of duty of 15 per cent on 1 July 1992, from the general phase down of tariff rates. The changes in this schedule implement that decision in relation to those goods imported from Canada.The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 contained a rationalisation, operative from 1 July 1993, of tariff subheadings covering certain spirits and spirituous liquors of chapter 22. The amendments in this schedule apply the February 1993 consumer price index adjustments to the newly rationalised subheadings.The schedule also contains a reduction of 3.103c per litre in the customs duty on aviation gasoline. This portion of the duty collected on aviation gasoline was attributed to aviation authorities to perform services on behalf of the aviation industry. The reduction is a reflection of lower Commonwealth costs due to the transfer of aerodromes to local ownership and the direct levying of charges for services previously provided by Commonwealth agencies on aviation industry users.Item 53 in schedule 4 to the principal act was created to provide a phasing regime for certain goods which were not components for passenger motor vehicles but were encompassed by the passenger motor vehicle components initiatives. Under these initiatives the goods would have had a duty rate of 15 per cent. The present amendment to split item 53 provides appropriate phasing rates of duty for these goods, some of which are subject to the governments decision to reduce the coverage of the Australian system of tariff preferences.Schedule 7 of this bill is operative on and from 5 July 1993 and amends the table to item 53A to redefine those tariff subheadings excluded from claiming the concessions accorded by this item. This bill also contains a number of other minor technical and administrative changes. Summaries of the amendments contained in this bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.Debate (on motion by Mr Cobb ) adjourned.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Currently the act provides for appropriation to the Civil Aviation Authority of duty on aviation gasoline. The purpose of the amendment is to enable duty on aviation turbine fuel—aviation kerosene—to also be appropriated to the CAA as part of the aviation safety regulation cost recovery regime.Government DecisionIn the 1992 Budget it was announced that the cost of aviation safety standard setting and surveillance would be jointly met by the government and the aviation industry. The government will meet 50 per cent of the costs up to a limit of $22.8 million in real terms. Cost recovery of the industrys portion of these costs is being phased in over two years from 1993-94. Cost recovery arrangements for 1993-94 involve a slight increase in duty on both aviation gasoline and aviation turbine fuel. The required increase, which applies from 1 September 1993, is 0.264 cents per litre.Because fuel used by Australian airlines on international services is exempt from duty, the CAA will introduce a fee for safety regulation in relation to these international operations. In implementing these cost recovery arrangements for 1993-94, the government has carefully noted the views expressed by the aviation industry.Post 1993-94 ArrangementsThe CAA is developing a long-term funding strategy for aviation safety regulation to apply from 1994-95. The development of the strategy will involve an examination of the economic and safety implications and impacts of possible mixes of charges and taxes on the aviation industry. The process will also involve extensive consultation with the aviation industry.Financial ImpactThe industrys contribution to aviation safety standard setting and surveillance for 1993-94 will reduce government outlays by $4.5 million. Users of aviation gasoline recently benefited from a 3c per litre reduction in duty and the CAA is currently exploring the prospect for a further reduction following the introduction of new airspace management arrangements in November this year.Given the very low rate of duty, therefore, the 1993-94 arrangements are not expected to result in any significant adverse financial impact on any particular aviation industry sector.

The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen.Part 2 of the bill amends Part II of the Disability Services Act 1986 and, although of a minor nature, will improve the professional administration of the disability services program. It will do so in two ways. Firstly, the amendment to section 14J of the Disability Services Act 1986 will make it clear that a statement which the minister is permitted to make under the section regarding funded organisations breaches of prescribed standards under the act will not become the subject of a defamation action, nor will any person who fairly reports or summarises the statement be liable for defamation. This amendment restates the common law. The provisions should save litigation costs.Secondly, where an organisations assets are to be transferred to another person, transferees will be asked under section 16 of the Disability Services Act 1986, as a condition of approval, to sign agreements acknowledging the extent of any Commonwealth equity in the transferred land, buildings and equipment. This will place transferees in the same situation as the original grantee with respect to the protection of Commonwealth equity.Part 3 of the bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973. The amendments in this part correct anomalies arising from the passage of the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991. In general, these amendments are of a minor technical and administrative nature and do not have any substantive effect.Clause 23DK extends the duty of responsibility for the keeping of relevant records to approved pathology authorities who were the employers of an approved pathology practitioner at the time the service was rendered and the approved pathology practitioner is no longer employed by the approved pathology authority. It is impractical to require the approved pathology practitioner to continue to carry the responsibility for the retention of records, created at a time when he or she was in the employ of the approved pathology authority, after that employment has ceased.Clause 23DNAA extends the exclusion of public authorities to include joint ventures between public authorities and private persons or corporations. Public authorities are funded through other arrangements. Without this amendment these joint ventures would be entitled to claim additional Medicare benefits as a private provider of pathology services. This is inconsistent with the intent of the Health Insurance Act 1973.Clause 23DNC provides for a review of determinations made with respect to the allocation of specimen collection licences in special circumstances. Under the existing provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973, determinations made under this section are not subject to review and may remain in force at the discretion of the licensee. This amendment is to implement measures to ensure that determinations made for the granting of specimen collection licences in special circumstances remains for as long as those special circumstances continue to exist.Part 4 of the bill makes three amendments to the Hearing Services Act 1991. The first of these is to extend the definition of eligible persons to include holders of a dependent treatment entitlement card. This will ensure that widows of veterans are adequately covered under this act. The second and third amendments provide for the official symbol of Australian Hearing Services to be included within the protected symbol provisions of the act and so prevent unauthorised use of the authoritys symbol.Part 5 of the bill amends the National Health Act 1953. The amendment provides that a pharmacist who wishes to relocate a pharmacy must obtain approval in respect of the new premises and that the Commonwealth cannot pay for pharmaceutical benefits which have been supplied from unapproved premises.These provisions have been in the NHA for many years. However, prior to the passage of the pharmacy restructuring legislation in December 1990 they were not rigorously enforced, particularly in the case of comparatively short distance relocations. In any case, approval of relocations was virtually automatic provided that the requirements of state law were met. As a result, it is suspected that a number of pharmacists have relocated their businesses without obtaining the necessary approval.Since the advent of the pharmacy restructuring, it has become necessary to enforce these provisions. The pharmacy restructuring guidelines provide for different rules to apply depending on the distance of a relocation, and also the distance to the nearest pharmacy is a consideration in granting an approval of a pharmacist or the payment of an essential pharmacy allowance.Some eight cases where a pharmacist had relocated without approval came to light during 1991-92. In these cases, act of grace payments and/or waivers of recovery were approved by the Minister for Finance.The Health Insurance Commission now wishes to conduct a survey to establish with certainty the location of each approved pharmacists premises. To ensure compliance with the survey by approved pharmacists, it wishes to assure them that they will not be penalised for unapproved relocations which occurred prior to the commencement of the pharmacy restructuring legislation.The Department of Finance considers it inappropriate to continue to use the act of grace and waiver powers to deal with what could be a large number of unapproved relocations. Thus to prevent an injustice in either seeking to recover moneys or to put a pharmacist out of business, we are seeking to amend the NHA to deem as approved at its new premises those approved pharmacists who relocated without obtaining approval prior to 18 December 1990—the date of effect of legislation establishing the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority.","N/A","HEALTH AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Part 7 of the bill repeals subsection 25(2) and section 38 of the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act 1986. These unproclaimed provisions relate to the regulation of government nursing homes under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974. With the transfer of responsibility for the regulation of nursing homes to the National Health Act 1953, the provisions are no longer needed.Part 8 of the Bill introduces a number of changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Clauses 29(h), 30, 31 and 32 will amend the principal act to facilitate the introduction of complementary state and territory legislation that will support the regulatory framework set up under the Commonwealths therapeutic goods legislation. Amendments to the objects of the Therapeutic Goods Act have been included to clarify the respective roles of the Commonwealth and the states and territories in establishing a uniform national system of controls over therapeutic goods.Uniform regulation over the quality, efficacy and safety of therapeutic goods manufactured for supply and use in Australia cannot be achieved without the establishment of corresponding state and territory laws that will adopt the Commonwealths regulatory requirements in respect of appropriate standards, including manufacturing and advertising standards, for therapeutic goods. The states and territories have agreed to set up complementary legislation to complement the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. It is anticipated that state complementary legislation will be in place by as early as 1994. When this occurs, the amendments to the principal act dealing with complementary legislation will be activated by proclamation.On 25 January 1993 Australia acceded to the convention for the mutual recognition of inspections in respect of the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. This convention allows for the mutual exchange of information on the manufacturing standards of manufacturers in the 18 signatory nations. This will allow regulatory authorities in those countries to establish the acceptability of manufacturing standards and procedures used in the manufacture of imported pharmaceutical products without the need for overseas inspections to be undertaken by the importing country. Under this scheme the export of Australian manufactured pharmaceutical products will be greatly enhanced. The inclusion of clauses 29(i), 37(b), 38(b), 47 and 50(d) will give effect to the convention.Changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act are necessary to clarify the application of the act to goods such as first aid kits and other packs containing mixed products. Such kits fall within the definitions of `therapeutic goods and `therapeutic use already existing in the Act. These amendments make provision for the inclusion in the register of kits, as a single entity, where the individual therapeutic goods contained in each kit have already been registered or listed in the register. Provision is also made to enable a number of kits to be grouped together, as a `gazetted kits group, so that each kit may share a common listing number and sponsors of groups of kits need only pay one set of annual charges for maintaining listings of grouped kits in the register.The proposals have been discussed with companies supplying kits and the industry associations and have their agreement. Entry of kits on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods is necessary to enable complete traceability of therapeutic goods which are supplied either separately or in the kits. Other amendments included in part 8 of this bill seek to clarify the meaning and operation of the Therapeutic Goods Act and to address problems that have surfaced since the act came into operation 2 1/2 years ago.The powers of the secretary to declare goods exempt from the operation of the act when labelled in a particular way is to be changed to close a potential loophole. Many goods may not qualify as therapeutic goods but for the way they are presented for supply. Therefore, the secretary may declare goods to be therapeutic goods where their presentation suggests any therapeutic use. At present, sponsors could label their goods in a certain manner to avoid regulation, yet subsequently advertise or present their products as therapeutic goods. The amendment will preclude this from happening.The definition of an `authorised person is to be amended to make appropriately experienced members of the Australian Federal Police authorised persons for the purposes of part 6 of the principal act. This will simplify administrative procedures when such officers are called upon to assist the therapeutic goods administration with its investigations into breaches of the principal act.The definition of `manufacturing premises is to be amended to remove the restriction that such premises are to be confined to buildings on sites. This will allow manufacturing activities to be undertaken in places other than buildings, including mobile vans used for collecting blood plasma. Such places usually present no increased hazard to the products being manufactured, and should be permitted.An amendment is required to enable an application fee to be charged for every application to add a new product into the register, even though the new product comes within a gazetted therapeutic goods group. At present, sponsors of goods that fall within the description of a gazetted therapeutic goods group only pay one application fee to include all such products in the register over a period of time. Agreement has been reached with industry on how the fee will apply and the levels of fee to apply.An amendment is required to introduce a penalty for a sponsor who fails to provide information or who provides false or misleading information. This amendment addresses problems experienced by the therapeutic goods administration in getting sponsors to provide information about the quality, safety or efficacy of therapeutic goods where there may be a concern over a product that has already been included in the register.At present, the act provides that in the event of entry and search of premises, evidence of the commission of offences may only be held for 60 days before commencement of prosecution. Experience in the first 2 1/2 years of operation of the act is showing this time frame to be too restrictive to allow for analysis or testing of goods, compiling of briefs, and laying of charges. This amendment will permit the therapeutic goods administration to make application to a magistrate for an extension to this 60-day period. A related amendment will extend the 12-month period in which prosecutions for certain offences may be brought under the act to two years.Amendments to section 66 of the principal act will clarify the position that goods included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods under the transitional arrangements, following the commencement of the principal act, may not necessarily have been evaluated or assessed. The transitional arrangements provided for a period of grace during which eligible sponsors of therapeutic goods could continue to supply unregistered and unlisted goods without committing an offence, whilst their goods were being included in the register by the therapeutic goods administration. Goods included in the register as a result of transitional arrangements may nevertheless still be evaluated or assessed at a later date, to establish whether or not such goods should remain in the register. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.Debate (on motion by Mr MacKellar ) adjourned.","N/A","HEALTH AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

The Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989—the principal act—imposes annual charges on the registration and listing of therapeutic goods, and on the licensing of manufacturers of therapeutic goods.This bill makes amendments to the principal act that complement simultaneous changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 that are introduced in part 8 of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992.Part 8 of that amendment bill introduces a number of changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to facilitate the introduction of complementary state and territory legislation that will support the regulatory framework set up under the Commonwealths therapeutic goods legislation. Details of these changes are contained in the second reading speech for that bill, and the associated explanatory memorandum. The amendments to the principal act that I am now introducing address the remaining administrative implications of these changes.The principal act will be amended to enable the Commonwealth to collect annual charges for maintaining registrations and listings of therapeutic goods, and for maintaining manufacturing licences, where such registrations, listings and licences have been effected on behalf of the states and territories under complementary therapeutic goods legislation. Charges to be collected by the Commonwealth for the performance of functions on behalf of the states or territories will be commensurate with the level of charges currently collected for the same activities performed in relation to therapeutic goods that are regulated under the Commonwealths jurisdiction.These amendments are subject to the establishment of corresponding state and territory laws that will adopt the Commonwealths regulatory requirements. It is anticipated that the first state and territory complementary legislation will be in place by as early as 1994.

The amendments to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill are as a result of the government acceding to the requests of the parliamentary Australian Labor Party caucus in particular. There have been certain changes to the treatment of shares, an initiative of this government in the 1992 budget context. These amendments will now stop the effect of the measure legislated for in December last year which was to come into effect in September of this year. In effect the amendments will take retrospectivity out of the measure, in that all pensioners who purchased shares prior to the date of the 1992 budget, 18 August 1992, will be exempted from this measure. Approximately 94,000 pensioners—of 104,000 estimated who would have been affected—have now been relieved of that measure. The government believes that any pensioners who now wish to buy shares and at the same time access the social security system do so with their eyes open, and would have done so with their eyes open since 18 August 1992.The other measure simply relates to partners with spouses in gaol. The date of application of that provision is changed.

Quite frankly, it is because the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs that deliberated on this matter—and it had members from both sides of the Senate—said in its report that at the very least the government should postpone the implementation of these provisions until next June. So the government walked back from what some of its own members were saying was a compromise position in that Senate report.Secondly, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) at the outset had the audacity to say that this satisfied caucus. The honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) came in here and said that we ought to exempt all people who hold shares and who are in nursing homes. She came into this parliament and said that all people who had share portfolios worth under $35,000 ought to be exempt. The fact is that the government has left in the net those categories of people who are not affected by the retrospectivity provisions. The fact is that all of the shortcomings that have been identified by all of the governments critics remain in place, but for a smaller number of people.The government wants us to applaud the fact that it has reduced the number of people affected by this iniquitous proposal; but it has not cured the defect. Also, the way in which this matter has been handled by the parliamentary secretary—and this was a matter that was contested on the last occasion on which we were in here—has led to a situation where people have acted to their detriment due to the way in which the government has reacted in relation to this matter.I know that the parliamentary secretary was of a resolute purpose so far as this matter is concerned. He wanted to see it through, we are to believe. Even when his advisers talked to the press they indicated he had been press-ganged in relation to this matter—that he would have been happier taking people off their benefits and forcing them to spend their own savings and their own resources beyond a certain level to survive before they made a claim on welfare. He went out into the byways and alleyways, and onto radio stations and elsewhere, to tell people that this was his objective. Of course, some people believed him. Those people who believed him sold their shares before the government announced that it was intending to have this change implemented—that is, a change to the effect that all people who owned shares before 18 August 1992 would be exempt from these provisions.The fact is that those people who have sold cannot go back and buy their shares; they would now be caught by these provisions. Some people who went out and sold shares on the ministers advice are in the situation where they have been caught not only by not being able to take advantage of this moderation but also by having to pay capital gains tax on shares on which—if they had not sold them, if they were unrealised—no capital gains tax would have been payable until perhaps they passed on. So people have been caught by that measure. People reacted reasonably in relation to that matter when one looks at some of the comments that were made by the parliamentary secretary. I do not want to go through all of the programs in which he appeared, but he was reported in the Canberra Times and he was on radio with Matthew Abraham on 2CN in Canberra in which he made some other comments. He was with Derryn Hinch. He wrote to some of his constituents. We have seen that. He was also on the Money show. On that show I think he put his intention most clearly. The interviewer said to him:But we are talking here about a notional profit. Now, all you can buy with a notional profit is notional groceries.The parliamentary secretary said:But not if you sell it.I underline those words: `not if you sell it. The interviewer said:Yes, but you cant even. . .Mr Sciacca: Yes, but not if you sell it.He had the audacity on the last occasion to make a personal explanation in this place in which he was saying he did not advise people that they should be selling their shares or assets. That was his personal explanation. But on the Money show he was saying that if people have had problems buying their groceries with a notional profit—in other words, buying notional groceries—they could overcome that by selling their assets, their shares, and they would have the money to live on.In case everybody believes that the department was all clear in relation to these matters, if we go back through some of the transcripts before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, it is quite clear that departmental officers when they were being approached on this matter were giving people much the same advice. When the committee sat in Adelaide it had some discussions with a Mrs Campeanu. She was one lady given that advice. Another person was a Mr Nicks. He had been before the Department of Social Security. The transcript reads:Senator FERGUSON —So he advised you to sell?Mr Nicks —He just said, `You will just have to sell. Then he came back a little later on and said, `You might go around to some credit union and they may be able to set you up with a superannuation. I said, I do not want to be in that. I do not want it to get any more complicated than it is now. Let it just lie as it is and wait for the outcome.Those are the sorts of discussions that were going on with financial advisers. I know they are well intentioned and presumably instructed not to give advice of this sort, but people in this situation were led to believe that selling their shares was the correct course to adopt. The difficulty they now face is that they have been disadvantaged.The one way that the government can fix that matter up and at least mitigate their damages is to repeal these provisions in their entirety—not to exempt those who would have been retrospectively affected. That affects only one particular aspect of the defects that were clear in this matter.I make it very clear to the minister that my reading of most of the comments is that, while most of the people have welcomed the fact that the government has gone this small step, they are of the view that it ought to go the whole way and review the operations of these provisions generally as they affect managed investments, as they affect shares, and that the government ought to repeal these provisions now as they affect shares in their entirety. People are of the view that there ought to be a full inquiry. I alert the chamber to the fact that we will be moving in another place that there be such a full inquiry. My colleague Senator Patterson has given notice of her intention to move that way.Finally, I am quite disappointed at the way in which the Australian Democrats have behaved in this matter. Having been so vigorous in their condemnation, to have walked away from this issue at the last moment as part of a shabby deal with the government to get its budget through is disgraceful. I am sure in the elderly community around Australia the Democrats will not be forgiven for the way they have walked away from this particular issue. The fact is that they had no guts to see it through and to hold the government to account on this matter as they have been demanding all the way through the discussions that we should be held to account in this matter.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
143,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr SCIACCA","6J4","(Bowman-","ALP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security)",982,"—I really cannot believe my ears. I see the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) opposite with other opposition members lined up behind him who have come in here to take credit for this move. They have berated the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and the Australian Democrats. Let me make it very clear to the honourable member for Berowra and everybody else on the other side that their hypocrisy on this whole issue has been shown up. The fact is, as everybody knows—it is legend now—that those opposite voted for it last year; their hypocrisy has been shown on this issue. They are trying now to get out of it by saying that they did it for certain reasons. However, this morning in the Senate they moved a number of amendments to repeal this legislation, knowing full well that the government would not accept the amendments even if they were passed; knowing full well that this was law as and from December of last year; and knowing full well that if the Senate had gone ahead and agreed to their amendments 94,000 people, who by the government amendments will not be affected on 23 September as a result of this measure, would have been affected.Therefore, the public of Australia, particularly the pensioner public with shares—those who had shares prior to 18 August 1992—have nothing to thank those opposite for. They know that, if those opposite had got their way this morning, on 23 September—because it was law—they would have been affected. Quite clearly, the public of Australia—those who will be affected by this, the 94,000 out of the 104,000 that are now not going to be affected—can thank the federal parliamentary Labour Party caucus and in particular the honourable member for Lowe and many other members who gave us their concerns and, to some degree, the Democrats whom those opposite are deriding in this place. At least the Democrats were prepared to allow this to go through.I know that my friend the honourable member for Berowra said previously that he would not berate us for changing, but I want to read what he said in this House on Monday, 30 August:There are only a few days left for the government to relent on this matter. I want to give the minister this assurance: I will not accuse the government of capitulation. I will not accuse the government of surrendering, of giving way, of giving ground or backing down. I will not try to make that point. I would be happy just to see the pensioner community relieved of the anxieties that they are genuinely suffering. At the moment, as the government is looking at backing down, capitulating, surrendering and giving way on the budget, it is getting a lot of flak. It could just add this matter in quietly. Right now, while the budget is under review, under retreat, there is a great challenge for the government to look at this matter again.That is exactly what we did, as a result of which 94,000 pensioners with shares will now not be affected; yet today in the other place the friends of the honourable member for Berowra tried to stop this measure. They did not care whether on 23 September these people would be affected. I ask the honourable member for Berowra to do the honourable thing and say, `Yes, I did listen—even take a little bit of the credit for himself if he wants—and at least have the gumption to admit that we did change it and that 90 per cent plus of the people involved in this measure have now been able to do it.There is another matter which I think is extremely important. On a number of occasions I have been accused in this House by the honourable member and others of giving incorrect advice on the question of shares. Let me make it clear that I have at all times behaved very honourably and correctly in this matter. The fact is that the law is the law. Every time that I have made statements I have always stated the position at that time—it was law. In case those opposite do not remember, it was law as and from December 1992.Whenever I have had the opportunity in a radio interview or whatever, I have made it clear that people should seek financial advice before deciding what to do. If pensioners had taken the advice of those opposite, I could well understand them turning around and accusing me and members of my department of misleading people. The reality is that that is not the case. The reality is that a lot of people would have gone out and sold their shares because they were worried about the effects of the legislation and because they were being told by members of the opposition to sell their shares.On Monday night, 30 August 1993, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) said:In recent days I have spoken to many pensioners in my electorate who have small share holdings and my advice to them, both as a member of parliament and as an accountant, is that they really have no option but to sell their shares. That was the advice the parliamentary secretary gave when he interjected on me in a previous debate. My advice, without exception, to those to whom I have spoken who are looking at their financial circumstances is that they ought to sell those shares.Later in that same debate on Monday of last week—this is evidence of what I have consistently been saying, although members of the opposition have taken my remarks out of context—I said:With the greatest respect to the honourable member for McPherson, he should know better than to make people concerned about something that does not apply. I have had the guts to admit that I am not a financial planner. The honourable member for McPherson is not a financial planner and, if he is an accountant, he does not know much about financial planning. So many financial planners in the community are publicly saying to pensioners who have got shares, `Dont necessarily go out and sell all your shares. Have a look at it.I then went on to say:But the honourable member for McPherson is making it sound as if everybody should run out and sell their shares. That is not only bad advice, but it is wrong advice, and he should not be saying that.Even as late as Monday of last week, I made my position very clear. The honourable member for Berowra mentioned a television program on which I appeared, the Money program, which I might add took some three-quarters of an hour to an hour to record. It was quite a long interview from which, as usual, they took out the nicest sorts of things from which they could get some dramatics. The point which was put to me, and which was addressed to the honourable member for Berowra and Senator Patterson in the other place, was that one cannot eat share scrip; it is notional profits, notional savings. That is true. The answer I gave was, `What you do is sell some of the shares. I have said that in other interviews.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The government on this matter, as in other budget matters, has been in such total chaos that it has led people around Australia, and certainly those in my electorate, to be confused. These are people who in the later years of their life have saved and made some wise investments in an attempt to plan for their old age. They were always brought up to believe the man from the government. Some of these people believed the man from the government and they sold their shares.I am delighted to say that there have been some phone calls to my office this week while I have been over here. One telephone call was from an 80-year-old man from Enfield in the northern end of my electorate. He was in tears of gratitude. He had been advised by departmental officers to sell his shares. He got some financial advice to sell his shares and I advised him not to, so he was ringing to express his great thanks.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

153,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Ms WORTH","8V5","(Adelaide)","LP","N/A",983,"—He took my advice. So that rather kills off this argument that we have been causing the chaos which has been leading people to sell their shares. Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) told me in Adelaide that the government would be definitely going ahead with this. On 11 August, the parliamentary secretary participated in an interview with Matthew Abraham on ABC Radio. In response to the question, `So, youre saying to pay for the groceries, you sell your shares?, amongst other things, the parliamentary secretary said:Resource whats available to you first before you come to the Australian taxpayer for assistance.Further on, he said:Now, the point is with shares, you can go and realise a share—its like a liquid investment on a twenty-four hour basis.Then he said:. . . a cheque, which is supposed to be liquid version of cash, is not as liquid as a share.If that is not giving a clear message to pensioners who own shares that that is the thing to do, then I am sadly mistaken. It has been widely commented upon by people other than those on my side of politics that pensioners have been led astray. I note that in the Australian Financial Review of 3 September, Barrie Dunstan wrote:The really grubby part of the past 12 months since the announcement is the insidious effect it has had on many pensioners, some of whom have lacked expert advice on how to respond.Mr Baldwin and his Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Con Sciacca, who did a media blitz a few weeks ago, are not necessarily immune from legal action from those pensioners who sold their shares before the test, unnecessarily as it turns out. But how many pensioners, short of a class action, would try to sue?Several of the Senate committee hearings heard evidence that officers of the Department of Social Security, officially or unofficially, advised pensioners to sell their shares. Mr Sciacca, in particular, reinforced this in media interviews last month.Those comments are not from anyone on my side of politics. They are reported in a national paper. But it is the people in my electorate that I represent about whom I am most concerned. I am particularly pleased that they heeded my urging—most of them stood and fought. They turned out in droves in Adelaide when the public inquiry was held. They stood up and fought back with petitions to the Senate. Many of them, of course, are feeling very pleased.The government can claim some credit for backing down so that only 10,000 pensioners are left affected. But it is the principle that is important. The principle is that we should be encouraging Australians, even if they are elderly and do not have great financial backing, to invest in sound Australian companies. If that principle was good enough for most of those pensioners, it should have been good enough for the other 10,000 pensioners who are affected.Even at this late stage, I would urge the government to see the error of its ways and ensure that this Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill is further amended, as everything else seems to be, so that these pensioners in particular will not be disadvantaged. Otherwise it would seem that there is a potential for some legal action to be taken on behalf of those pensioners who have found themselves affected. Not only have they had their nest egg changed into hard cash—liquid cash, as the parliamentary secretary suggested—but also some of them have had to pay capital gains tax. Those pensioners cannot now buy back into that market because of the changing rules. These are people who are of an age when they do not appreciate changing rules. They live by the rules; that is the way they see it. I urge the government to rethink its strategy.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
154,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr GIBSON","ST4","(Moreton)","ALP","N/A",984,"—The situation that we have before us today is the result of extreme oppositionist politics on the part of those sitting opposite. We have a situation where the opposition is opposing any measure that the government introduces regardless of what that measure might be. The total hypocrisy of the opposition in this regard is mind-boggling. I could not believe that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock)—normally a reasonable and intelligent person—could stoop to such absolute hypocrisy and oppositionist politics.The opposition has been shown up for what it is. It is not prepared to look at each question on its merits—to sit back and look at the legislation and decide what the merits of that legislation might be. All it will do is oppose, oppose, oppose, regardless of what benefits there might be for the people of Australia. For the last 10 months we have had an amazing record of hypocrisy on the part of the opposition. It has now taken that hypocrisy to new depths.In effect, we are now debating the fact that the government has listened to the community and to government backbenchers and has responded by amending a measure in order to remove the retrospectivity provision relating to share portfolios. That amendment does not change the equity principle contained in the measure. And this is an equitable measure. That is what the opposition cannot understand: this is an equitable measure to treat shares the same way as other managed investments.What was unfair, what was having an impact on my constituents, and what I was prepared to raise with the government in my discussions with the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) was the fact that it was having a negative impact on those pensioners who bought shares a few years ago at high prices. For those pensioners whose share prices have fallen, the retrospective introduction of this measure from 23 September last year was going to have a negative impact.The government has responded to that issue of fairness and has decided that all shares purchased prior to the date of the 1992 budget will not be affected by this measure, but that shares purchased after that date will be. The reason is that pensioners who purchased shares after that date did so knowing full well that any capital gains made on those shares would be treated as income and would affect their pension.That is a fair measure. Treatment of the growth in value of shares as a source of income is an equitable means of measuring peoples assets, income, and capacity to fend for themselves and provide for their own needs. It brings shares into line with other forms of investment, particularly managed investments.With the amendment we are debating, the government has removed the retrospective element of the legislation, treating the shares issue in the same way as it has treated superannuation, for example. It has said that shares purchased since the date of the announcement of the new measure will be assessed as income, while shares purchased prior to that date will not. That is a fair amendment. That is an example of a government acting in response to its community and its backbench—listening to us as members of the parliament. It has listened to me. I have always found the parliamentary secretary and the minister to be very responsive. I appreciate the fact that they have listened to the community, responded to the pensioners concerned, and are making this change.We have heard the argument that, because some pensioners are selling their shares and somehow losing out, it is all our fault. We did not advise people to sell their shares; that advice came from those opposite. The parliamentary secretary quoted the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) telling us that he has advised his constituents to sell their shares. That was his responsibility. Apparently, other members of the opposition have been doing the same thing.For that reason they should not come to us now crying crocodile tears. They were advising pensioners to sell their shares. Now that those same pensioners have sold them they find that they should not have sold them because the government has amended the measure in such a way that shares purchased prior to the budget last year will not be affected. Honourable members opposite are the ones who should carry the can for that.The honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) told us that pensioners are threatening legal action against the government and that she will be encouraging them to do that. That is a scandalous thing for any honourable member to be suggesting. It will result in pensioners losing money by wasting it on legal action. Those opposite must know that such legal action would fail. It would simply be a waste of their money.The opposition talks about its concern for pensioners losing money, yet it encourages them to lose it by going to solicitors and taking legal action against the government. If it were truly concerned about pensioners incomes it would not be advising them to take such a stupid course.The opposition has opposed this measure because it thinks we are trying to hurt pensioners by ripping them off and affecting their income. In fact, only three per cent of pensioners would have been affected by this measure. I am not sure of the exact proportion of the originally estimated 10,000 that will still be affected, but it is only around 0.2 per cent of pensioners.I wonder what the opposition would have done if it were on this side of the chamber? The measure we are introducing was designed to save $80 million. That $80 million was to be used to provide fringe benefits to all part-pensioners. That was going to cost $120 million.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

156,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr GIBSON","ST4","(Moreton)","ALP","N/A",984,"—What was the opposition going to do if it were on this side of the chamber? It was going to rip off $10 billion from the social welfare budget. Yet those opposite have the hide to cry crocodile tears about what we might be doing to a few pensioners who have shares and are earning income.They were the ones who were going to destroy the fabric of our social welfare system. They were going to rip the heart out of social welfare. They were going to destroy the nature of the safety net and the system we have to support people who do not have a very strong income. They should not dare to come in here, crying their crocodile tears, espousing this hypocritical argument that they are looking after pensioners and we are the evil, nasty ones. I have never heard such poppycock in all my life.People in this country know who it is that will look after pensioners and support pensioners—the Labor Party. The Liberal and National parties have never had any sort of commitment to the social welfare system in this country. They have never had any commitment to the care of the aged. We have had to fight against them every step of the way in order to introduce decent social welfare programs. They are the ones who want to rip the heart out of the social fabric of this society. They have no right at all to come in here and claim that they are the protectors of the aged because they certainly are not.The aged community knows full well that they are hypocrites. They should not come in here with their oppositionist style of politics and oppose this measure when they know that it is a fair and equitable measure and that the vast majority of pensioners do not own any shares. They were subsidising those who own a few shares, who were able to gain some income through them. We were bringing equity back into the system. The small savings that we were going to make were to be expended on the provision of other support for thousands and tens of thousands of other part-pensioners by extending fringe benefits.That is how we operate. We operate an equitable system of social welfare payments, not like the opposition which would rip the heart out of the social welfare system. I believe that the opposition amendment must be vigorously opposed. I support the government and congratulate the parliament secretary for his work in drafting this amendment which will make for a more equitable measure.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
157,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CAMERON","6V5","(Stirling)","LP","N/A",986,"—In the months that I have been in this place I have heard some amazing things coming from the government benches, but todays offerings just about take the cake. For the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) to mention `fairness in the same breath as this legislation is so bizarre as to be incomprehensible. His suggestion that we were telling people to sell their shares was simply unbelievable.I extend an invitation to the honourable member for Moreton to come to Western Australia and visit me in my electorate office. He would be made most welcome. If he wishes, we could hire protection for him. He could then explain this legislation to my many constituents who are terrified out of their brains because of the performance that this mob has put on.Just the fact that the government has done a partial backflip on this legislation does not mean that it is any more right. This was completely wrong three weeks ago; it was wrong last week; it is still wrong this week. The fact is that the government has disenfranchised so many people as to now put a prohibition on the elderly to the extent that they cannot buy shares—how utterly ridiculous!In my own family, my parents, who had the grand total of $20,000 worth of shares which they had scraped together through a life of hard work and trying to look after themselves in their retirement, said to me, `Should we sell these shares because of what the government is going to do to us?. I said to them, `Look, bizarre as this government may be, and as much as it may have lied its way through an election, surely not even this government would go through with this little lot. Dont sell your shares. My father did not take my advice. He sold his shares and now, of course, finds that I was correct in telling him not to sell those shares. He now has joined many other Australians, since this big scare began, and gone straight onto the government tit in the form of an old age pension. That is probably what government members wanted in the first place because they love to have people dependent upon them.It is a disgrace that the government puts this extra burden on the Australian taxpayers. My parents were not just one of a couple of people; very many Australian pensioners sold their shares. It is regrettable that the governments grandstanding and sticking its head in the sand have forced many pensioners into this situation.One particular pensioner in my electorate of Stirling, Reg Manus, has had his pension cut by 80 per cent. Why is he still being punished? He was told by the Department of Social Security that there was no change at all for him. How many extra people have been employed by the Department of Social Security to try to patch up this awful mess? Will pensioners who bought shares before last years budget, who have entitlements to rights issues and bonus shares after the budget, have their pension cut? This has not yet been answered.The legislation, in principle, is still the same. It should be repealed lock, stock and barrel. How many pensioners will now buy shares? Zilch, because they would be crazy to. Why should a certain section of Australias population have a prohibition on them from looking after themselves in their old age? It is still not income, it is still unrealised. Pensioners who buy shares which rise in value will still have their pensions cut despite not having one extra cent to buy those notional groceries. It is therefore still unfair, mean spirited, stupid and totally wrong, and the government should repeal it entirely.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
158,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr SCIACCA","6J4","(Bowman-","ALP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security)",987,"—I put it clearly on the record that those approximately 94,000 people that are going to escape this measure on 23 September have a number of people to thank. Certainly they should not be thanking the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron), the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) or the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock)—or anybody on the other side. They should instead be thanking those members of the federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus that got up and said that this measure should not go ahead. I am talking of the honourable member for Lowe (Ms Easson), the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) and a number of others; they are the ones such people should thank. In fact, the true position is that, if those in the Liberal and the National parties had got up in the other place this morning, those same 94,000 people would be blaming them, properly, because on 23 September they would have been affected by this measure.On this occasion I want to thank the Democrats; at least they have been honourable and consistent, and have been for a long time. They voted against this measure last year, and they voted against it again this year. When the chips were down, they knew that they wanted to help these 94,000 people. What they did was vote to allow those 94,000 people to be helped. There is no credit at all due to members of the opposition. I notice they have all come into the chamber and lined up because they all want to be able to go to their electorates and tell their electors that it was because of them that this measure has been changed. The reality is that they voted for the measure themselves last year, and this morning they wanted to make sure that the over 90 per cent of people who would have been affected by this measure on 23 September did not get any advantage.In conclusion, the government is now saying that, if a pensioner is in receipt of moneys from the social security system and wants to buy some shares, that pensioner does so with his or her eyes open and on the basis of the intrinsic value of those shares as an investment, not because he or she might want to access any part of the social security system. The fact is that approximately 10,000 people have purchased shares since the announcement of this measure in the budget of 1992. Under those circumstances, the government believes that it is only fair that those people who would have known about this measure—or should have known if they had even a half good financial adviser or stockbroker—should still be covered.The integrity of the social security system is still intact. The fact is that the needs based social security system is still intact. As the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said before, the fact is that the opposition wanted to take hundreds of millions of dollars—I think it was closer to $1 billion—off the social security budget. Yet it comes to us and wants to stop us from doing exactly the same.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[7]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The delegation presented an interim report in January 1993 and, after further examination of the data and information collected on this trip, is now in a position to present its final report.The report contains a large number of recommendations to the government and the parliament on our relations with the countries of the Middle East, especially countries which the delegation visited. Those countries were Iran, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and the Occupied Territories. During our visit an important role of the delegation was to encourage the Middle East peace process. We were able to bring that message to all the very important people we met—and we were very well received by all the countries we visited.We saw, amongst other people, the speakers of each of the parliaments of the four countries. We met with a number of prime ministers, foreign ministers and other senior ministers, as well as a range of parliamentarians. We also met with senior representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Jordan, Egypt and Israel.There is no doubt that the overall impression of the delegation was of bringing a message from both the main parties in the Australian parliament of our great desire that everything be done to achieve peace in the Middle East, and that concessions should be made by all sides.The key recommendation of the report is that the government should substantially increase its involvement in the Middle East peace process. Firstly, it should recognise that the Palestinian people have a right to a homeland in the Middle East. The report states:. . . in the event of Israel and the Palestinians reaching an agreement, Australia should encourage moderate Palestinian representatives by granting them increased diplomatic recognition.Secondly, it should offer its participation in other multilateral negotiations, such as those dealing with economics, water issues, the environment and refugees. Thirdly, it should actively use its goodwill among the various countries of the Middle East and make its full diplomatic facilities available to assist in clearing any bottlenecks which arise in the bilateral negotiations and slow down the achievement of a solution.The delegation concluded its visit with some optimism because of the increasing flexibility it detected in Jordan and amongst the Palestinians in Jordan, Egypt and Israel. The delegations meetings with Palestinian leaders in Jordan, Egypt and the West Bank had reinforced the view that many of the leaders of the PLO are now seeking peace through a formula which would exchange land occupied since 1967 in return for full recognition of the existence of Israel, including the establishment of links between the West Bank Palestinians and Israel.I am pleased with, and strongly support, the approach of both the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Rabin, and the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr Shimon Peres, who have accepted the need for Israel to make concessions to achieve peace. I know from discussions with Mr Peres that the Rabin government is not concerned merely with electoral timetables but with achieving the goals of the historic mandate it has been given to achieve peace.In the interim report of January 1993, the delegation noted that the PLO already had made a major concession in recognising Israels right to exist with a statement made by the PLO chairman, Mr Yasser Arafat, and other Palestinian leaders in 1988. In addition, the Palestinians had accepted that they cannot move to a fully independent state at once, but that an interim period is necessary to establish goodwill between the Palestinian and Israeli people.The delegation also noted that there had been some Palestinian and Arab acceptance of the existence of a state of Israel within secure boundaries but it called for an even stronger affirmation of that recognition, especially in the charter of the Palestinian National Council. The delegation also noted at the time that resolution of the Palestinian dispute could be achieved by the early introduction of meaningful interim self-governing arrangements for Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, with provision for such arrangements to be followed within three to five years by an act of genuine self-determination by the Palestinian people.In the last three weeks the PLO and Israel have made concessions to each other along these lines. A major breakthrough now seems imminent in the next round of talks. Such a breakthrough would be a confirmation of the goodwill which the delegation discovered amongst moderate people on all sides in the region.However, we should not underestimate the fact that extremist and fundamentalist elements remain a main obstacle to peace. The delegation was most concerned at the rise of fundamentalist and extremist movements throughout the Middle East. It made a special effort to find out as much as it could about the role, beliefs and actions of the various fundamentalist groups. One of the most dramatic meetings of the trip was in Egypt where the delegation met the fundamentalist leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mr MaMoun El-Hodeiby, and his supporters.The delegation was one of the first Western parliamentary groups to visit Iran and was pleased to discover a number of positive developments. Nevertheless, there are tensions within that society, as westward-looking pragmatists jostle with all those who support maintenance of a strict application of fundamentalist principles in all walks of Iranian life in determining the clear direction of the country. We will be following those developments closely.The report makes a number of recommendations directed towards strengthening Australias relations with the region. These include: firstly, taking the opportunity to significantly expand trade relations with all four countries; secondly, increasing the people-to-people contact through cultural and educational exchanges; thirdly, increasing parliamentary exchanges and encouraging the formation of parliamentary friendship groups; and, fourthly, establishing and upgrading air links between Australia and the four countries. The delegation also made specific observations and recommendations on issues affecting each of the four countries, and they are included in the report.I thank all members of the delegation for their close cooperation and work. In particular, I thank former Senator Austin Lewis, the deputy leader; you, Mr Deputy Speaker; the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris); the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) and Mr Russell Broadbent, the former member for Corinella. Mr Trevor Rowe, the secretary to the delegation, was of great assistance, as were the Australian ambassadors in the four countries and the Department of Foreign Affairs officials who assisted in making the mission a great success. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) wrote to me after the interim report was produced, saying:I must thank you and your delegation for this most interesting Report, which I note covers a wide range of issues of concern to Australia, including the Middle East peace process. I congratulate the delegation for the diligence it has applied in the preparation of the Report and for the contribution it has made to Australias relations with the countries of this important region.I have noted the recommendations of the Report. You will appreciate that, at this stage, it will be a matter for the incoming government to consider how it may wish to respond.That was on 8 March. Since then the election has been held and, with the presentation of this report, we now await the governments response to the recommendations of the report. Once again, I thank all my colleagues for their assistance in the preparation of the report and on the delegation.","N/A","DELEGATION REPORTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
166,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mrs GALLUS","CU4","(Hindmarsh)","LP","N/A",993,"—by leave—Mr Deputy Speaker, it is appropriate that you are in the chair at this time, as a member of the Parliamentary Delegation to the Middle East. I endorse all the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). For me it was an extremely educative and interesting trip.What stands out in my memory very much is what we learnt from the society in Iran. Stemming not so much from Iran, where Islamic fundamentalism is already established, but later from the Middle East was, as the honourable member for Calwell has mentioned, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the Middle East. This appears to be somewhat underestimated back in Australia. The statistics given to us here do not show exactly the extent of the rise of the Islamic movement throughout the Middle East.It is particularly concerning to me, as a woman, for, despite the rhetoric of those who speak about Islamic fundamentalism, there is no doubt that women in that culture are second-class citizens. The people from the Muslim Brotherhood said to us that women are equal but different, but I do not think that in their hearts they believed it. When they spoke of a separate education system for men and women, we knew that the education system that women were going to receive under that type of fundamentalist government was going to be second-class.The key to the whole trip was probably the chance to view the peace process, if not at first-hand then almost at first-hand. It was being part of history to talk to the people whom we had the opportunity to talk to. They included the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres; representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation; the then Prime Minister of Jordan; and the current Jordanian Prime Minister, Dr Majali, then Jordans chief Middle East peace negotiator.Conversations with these people gave us a sense of what was happening in the Middle East and also convinced us of their very real commitment to peace in the Middle East. I think that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would join with me in saying that, if anything came out of that, it was the real conviction that in every country we visited which had a part in the peace process there was a deep and genuine commitment to that process.Of course, since then enormous things have happened in the world and there is now a draft agreement paving the way for possible autonomy for the Gaza Strip and Jericho. This is momentous, as I think the press has made very clear in recent days. However, we are aware, as I think everybody would be—especially as a result of our trip to the Middle East—that this peace will not be achieved easily. There are already problems with what has been arranged. The Israeli settlers are virulently opposed to such an agreement. Even without their opposition, there would always be the question: what happens in the future to those Israeli settlers?The Likud, the opposition party in the Israeli government, is opposed to the agreement. We must remember that the Labour Party has only a slim majority and is dependent on five or six groups to govern. While we were there, the difficulty the government has in controlling those votes was brought home to us. It is a major problem for that government.On the Arab side, there is the problem of the radicals within the PLO. The question that everybody has asked is how long Arafat can remain safe when there are people in his own organisation who do not want this agreement. There is the Hamas. It is imperative that Arafat control the Hamas, because this is what the Israeli government will expect of him. Whether or not he can control them is another question. Arafat must also answer the rhetoric from the Palestinians in Syria.Above all these problems, there is the remaining problem of East Jerusalem. I remember that we put this question to the PLO during our visit. The answer we received at that time was that that is the difficult question and will be the last question answered. It is obvious that there must now be trust in the Middle East. The pragmatists and the moderates must contain the radicals and we must get the peace which the whole world is waiting for.In conclusion, I applaud the excellent leadership of the delegation by the honourable member for Calwell and the assistance given to it by its secretary, Trevor Rowe.","N/A","DELEGATION REPORTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I support the words of the honourable member for Calwell when he referred to the delegations recommendations. I think we often underestimate the implications of Australias position in the world, particularly in the Middle East.One of the great rewards of this delegation was the understanding of how well Australia was regarded. For that, I think we owe a great debt to our ambassadors and our embassy staff in the four countries that we visited. The fact that we are playing an active role in the peace process was not so much a surprise, but in fact a reassurance to us that as a country we are well perceived and well respected. Minister Peress request that we play an increased role in the bilateral negotiations I think was well meant and well intentioned.Subsequent to the delegations visit to the area, there has been a visit to Australia by the Jordanian minister of trade and also the Iranian Minister of Mines and Metal. I am sure both of those delegations were made more successful because of the contacts that had been made through our efforts.In a sense, delegations open up a dialogue. These ones extended a dialogue that had gone on previously, but not at the parliamentary level. There is no doubt that in the weeks ahead people coming to the IPU will be those that we spoke to from the delegations. I am sure their visit will give them a more positive view of Australia.In closing, I pay my respects to the leader of the delegation for his excellent work and particularly to Mr Trevor Rowe for his arduous efforts. I think we were fortunate to have a young, agile and quite strong secretary. The documentation to be moved around the delegation required a degree of energy and Trevor Rowe did a superb job.I particularly thank all those people from foreign affairs and from our embassies who assisted us both before and during the delegation. I commend the report to members of the House and I trust that most honourable members will take the trouble of reading it.","N/A","DELEGATION REPORTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

171,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ROCHER","ZI4","(Curtin)","LP","N/A",995,"—The Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill amends the Commonwealth Bank Act 1959 to reduce the federal governments equity in the Commonwealth Bank from the current 70 per cent to a minimum of 50.1 per cent. The bill also provides for a one-off capital injection, plus an ongoing subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank to expand its lending activities to small businesses. The charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank is also amended to allow it to meet the full credit requirements of its small business borrowers, instead of being confined to the role of provider of supplementary finance, as it is at present.The bill comes before us as a result of the governments decision to delay the sale of 75 per cent of Qantas until 1994-95. The aborted sale of Qantas potentially left a huge hole in the federal governments finances, which had to be filled if the deficit was not to blow out beyond the already horrendous $16 billion or more that we have been saddled with during this financial year. As a result, the sale of the Commonwealth Bank has been brought forward to fill the gap that would otherwise have been left by the failure to sell Qantas.The government anticipates that at current share prices the sale of a further 19 per cent of the Commonwealths equity in the Commonwealth Bank will raise some $1.5 billion. This $1.5 billion is a large part of the funds the government expects to raise through asset sales over the next two years. The sale of more of the governments equity in the Commonwealth Bank is part of some $2.4 billion in projected asset sales this financial year. The government also anticipates making further asset sales in 1994-95 of $2.1 billion.These figures represent a considerable increase over asset sales that were realised in the previous financial year, which is indicative of the ongoing failure of this governments privatisation program. Last year the government budgeted for a total of $1.6 billion in asset sales. Like so many of its forecasts, however, this figure proved to be wildly optimistic. Unfortunately for the budget, only $800 million in asset sales were made in the last financial year. In other words, the government only achieved half of what it set out to do by way of privatisation in the last financial year.So Labor clearly has a lot of catching up to do to get its privatisation program back on track—if indeed it was ever on track to begin with. Since the 1988-89 budget, this government has consistently failed year after year to realise its privatisation targets, and last years budget was no exception. It remains to be seen what the government will or will not achieve this year but, if past experience is anything to go by, then we do not have much reason to be hopeful.The problem with this Labor government is that it has always been a reluctant privatiser. It originally, vehemently opposed privatisation, and once enjoyed making political mileage out of the coalitions support for privatisation, despite the obvious benefits that privatisation had to offer everyone concerned—not least the taxpayers of Australia.But, over the unnaturally long life of this government, it has found itself increasingly strapped for cash, and so it began the process of selling off some peripheral Commonwealth assets in an attempt to balance the books from about 1987. Asset sales became a substantial contributor to the governments all too few and all too brief budget surpluses of the late 1980s, and the government has since become less and less reluctant to privatise the Commonwealths assets. Labor has certainly come a long way from its initial opposition to privatising anything.Unfortunately, the governments embrace of privatisation has been motivated by all the wrong reasons, which accounts for the general failure of its efforts to date. The government has been primarily concerned with using asset sales to raise extra cash, which has then been largely allocated to increased government consumption expenditure by the Commonwealth. This is the worst thing that one can do with the proceeds of privatisation, since it reduces the amount of fiscal discipline on the government of the day, which is exactly what has happened under Labor.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

173,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ROCHER","ZI4","(Curtin)","LP","N/A",995,"—Yes, indeed, and I will make that point at some length. The proceeds from privatisation should be used to retrench government debt, which serves to balance the books in a genuine sense rather than the superficial sense that shows up in the budget papers each year. The budget papers treat asset sales as negative outlays—what a strange term—which gives the appearance of a reduced budget deficit in consequence.However, if the government adhered to the accounting conventions that prevail in the private sector, then the proceeds from asset sales would have no such effect, since they would appear as an extraordinary one-off item. Government accounting conventions are utilised to abuse the privatisation process for this governments own short-term fiscally expedient ends. Labor has no sense of the contribution that privatisation can make to greater economic activity, reduced government debt and public debt interest payments. It is because the government has no real understanding of what privatisation should be all about that it makes such a mess of its privatisation program.The sale of the governments equity in the Commonwealth Bank is a case in point. For many years the government opposed the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, despite the clear anachronism of a government being involved in the provision of retail banking services. A consequence is that the performance of the Commonwealth Bank has suffered, and continues to suffer, from its inadequate level of capitalisation.Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall, that the State Bank of Victoria then went belly-up—courtesy of the Labor government in Victoria—and Labor in Canberra saw an opportunity to expand the Commonwealth Banks equity base through a public float that would allow it to fund the purchase of that stricken financial institution. The government has maintained that this did not entail a reduction in the public ownership of the bank, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has tried to argue—somewhat farcically—that this did not entail the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank.Now the government that once opposed privatisation in general, and privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank in particular, will be reducing its equity in the Commonwealth Bank by 19 per cent—from 70 per cent to 51 per cent. The Commonwealth will thereby retain majority ownership in the bank. In a sense, this decision by this government is to be welcomed as a step in the right direction, but it does beg the question as to why the government does not proceed with the complete sale of the bank, as has been proposed for some time now by the coalition.There is simply no point in the Commonwealth retaining majority ownership of the Commonwealth Bank, any more than it makes sense to own a bare majority of the various other government business enterprises that the government lacks the sense and will to privatise. It is bad for the bank, and it is bad for the governments continuing interest in the sale of the bank. But Labor persists with majority ownership because it is still carrying some of the discredited ideological baggage of its attempted nationalisation of the Australian economy in the immediate postwar years.On behalf of the coalition, I propose to move an amendment to point the way in which the government should be going—although, given what Labor will do with the proceeds of such a sale, perhaps it is not a bad thing that it will probably oppose our amendment. It should be noted that there is a wave of privatisation sweeping the world at the present time. According to the Economist magazine, there were $US69 billion worth of privatisations last year in over 50 countries. Since 1985, over $US328 billion in state owned assets have been sold worldwide. Clearly this is not a phenomenon limited to Thatchers Britain, as some honourable members opposite like to kid themselves into believing. Every significant country in the world, no matter what its political complexion, has been engaged in the systematic privatisation of state assets since the 1980s, and the phenomenon is set to continue into the 1990s. Some estimates put the value of asset sales in western Europe alone by 1998 as high as $US150 billion.Not all these governments are privatising for the right reasons, just as this Labor government here in Australia is not, but at least they are privatising to an extent that puts Labor and its meagre efforts to shame. A global revolution is taking place that is shifting more and more ownership into the hands of the private sector where it belongs. But Australia, it would seem, is missing the privatisation boat. There are quasi-socialist regimes in Third World countries that are more committed to privatisation than is this government. Of course, the Third World leaders are getting pay television, so it is hardly surprising that they would be whipping us in the privatisation stakes as well.The governments handling of this further sale of equity in the Commonwealth Bank has been botched from the outset. The government has done an appalling job in providing the market with appropriate information on the structure of the sale which has led to underinformed, if not misinformed, trading in CBA shares. So little information was provided by this government that the Australian Stock Exchange took the unusual step of requesting from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) further details of the structure of the proposed sale so that the market could be reasonably informed. In particular, there was the issue of what rights existing shareholders would have to the new share issue, which obviously has an impact on the price of existing shares in the marketplace. The response from the Minister for Finance was to advise that the proposed offer structure had not yet been determined and the government would advise the Stock Exchange of its structure in due course.Labors inability to supply these and other details led to the market for CBA shares being driven by speculation and inadequate information. This served to put the directors of the Commonwealth Bank in a difficult situation since they are contractually obliged to immediately disclose any information that is necessary to ensure an informed market in the CBA shares. Unfortunately for the directors, they were not in a position to discharge their obligations since they were reliant on a government to supply them with the necessary information. Of course, Labor had no such contractual obligations to worry about, and so had no qualms about leaving the directors of the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian Stock Exchange in the lurch while it made up its mind as to exactly what it was proposing to do.In a similar vein the government has been careful to avoid assuming any personal liability under the prospectus provisions of the Corporations Law for its handling of the sale of the additional 19 per cent of the banks equity. Labor is quite unprepared to assume for itself and its own the same obligations that it requires of everyone else under Corporations Law. Instead, it has been concerned to ensure that any such liability rests squarely with the Commonwealth Banks directors, despite the limitations on their role in determining the relevant details of the proposed sell off. By its actions, the government has shown itself to be quite ignorant of the realities of the marketplace and poorly equipped to handle the further privatisation of the bank.Many of these problems could have been avoided if Labor had undertaken to sell 100 per cent of the bank into private ownership, which would have resulted in a more definite offer structure. But, so long as it persists in retaining majority ownership, the government will have to confront the problems that face anyone determined to be only a little pregnant in the privatisation game.The bill also provides for a one-off capital injection of $30 million into the Commonwealth Development Bank in 1993-94. As well, provision is made for a continuing subsidy to be made to the Commonwealth Bank of $20 million per year, beginning in 1993-94. Capital injections take the form of Commonwealth Development Bank shares being issued to the Commonwealth, which will allow the government to receive dividend payments from the bank.The stated purpose of this capital injection and ongoing subsidy is to expand the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank in its lending activities to small business. To this end, the charter of the CDB is also amended to enable it to cater to the full credit requirements of its borrowers instead of just being a provider of supplementary finance additional to that provided by other lenders.The Commonwealth Development Bank has been a relatively successful institution, unlike other government owned financial intermediaries. It has certainly been more successful than comparable bodies such as the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The CDB has developed considerable expertise in lending to the small business sector, particularly in providing risk capital to undercapitalised small businesses on a longer term basis.The CDB is a subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank, and the Commonwealth Bank often makes use of the CDBs skills in assessing potential borrowers, and that is an added benefit to the parent company. Generally, the CDBs loans have been referred from the Commonwealth Bank, although the CDB in recent years has increasingly approved loans for the clients of other banks, and that is also a welcome development.The liabilities of the Commonwealth Development Bank are guaranteed by the Commonwealth under the act that the bill before us today seeks to amend. The Commonwealth Development Bank generally experiences lower returns on its equity compared with other banks, which is to be expected I suppose, given that the nature of its business is determined by its existing charter. The changes to the CDBs charter in this bill, to allow the bank to meet the full credit needs of its borrowers, will hopefully increase the return on its equity to the benefit of the Commonwealth as a shareholder. Whether this will provide an adequate return on the Commonwealths increased equity and ongoing subsidy as provided for in this bill, only time will tell.Until now, the CDB has operated without budgetary assistance from the Commonwealth, so this bill represents a substantial increase in the cost of the bank to the taxpayer. This increase in the taxpayers stake in the bank gives us reason to hope that the changes to the CDBs charter contained in this bill will enable it to increase its return on its equity. Nevertheless, we have some misgivings and seek some assurances, and that is why one part of the amendment which I shall move before concluding is there.The changes to the CDBs charter contained in this bill raise questions about the future role of the bank and, in particular, whether the Commonwealth Development Bank continues to have a legitimate role to play in the wake of financial deregulation, to which we hear our spaced-out Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and our stressed-out Prime Minister make reference on so many occasions. The CDB has always been justified on the basis that it fills a gap in the market supply of capital that was not being met by other credit providers. The CDB has built its relatively successful operations around that gap.The changes to the charter of the bank contained in this bill will, we are told, enable the CDB to expand its activities beyond its traditional role as a supplementary credit provider. Up until now, the CDB has only considered loans that had been rejected previously by the applicants private bank. The bank will still specialise in providing risk capital to small business, but it will now seek to meet the full credit requirements of its borrowers and not just their top-up finance needs.It is arguable whether this is a necessary or desirable move in the wake of financial deregulation. Since deregulation, as the Industry Commission has noted, trading banks have increasingly been able to supply credit to higher risk small businesses, since they are no longer subject to the lending controls over their small business loans which caused them to ration their small business finance in the past. Indeed, it is well known that during the 1980s many trading banks lent too much money to riskier businesses, both large and small, and have been trying to scale back some of that lending in the period since.The result has been that the Commonwealth Development Bank has moved increasingly to the riskier end of the lending spectrum as the trading banks have encroached on some of the CDBs traditional territory. The bank rejects, nevertheless, most of the lending proposals that it receives, and the rejection rate has been increasing in recent years. It is not surprising then that the government should want the Commonwealth Development Bank to be able to expand the range of its lending activities. But this has highlighted that in the wake of financial deregulation there is less and less need for government to be directing capital into particular areas through government owned financial intermediaries such as the Commonwealth Development Bank. This is true, no matter how good the CDB might be at its lending activities. This has implications for the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank that need to be given serious consideration in the context of selling off the Commonwealth Bank—the parent company. The Industry Commission has observed:To the extent that the Australian Government may wish the CDB to provide services beyond the point at which they can be commercially provided, the CDB may not sit comfortably as a subsidiary of a partly privatised Commonwealth Bank.This is even more true of a fully privatised Commonwealth Bank as proposed by the coalition. So, to the extent that the CDBs lending activities can be put on a commercial footing, there is less and less need for a government funded, specialised lending body to carry out activities that can be undertaken by the commercial trading banks, of which the Commonwealth Bank is one. The Industry Commission also had this to say:The extensive deregulatory changes of the 1980s have meant that there are few barriers to entry to any segment of the finance sector. The result is an extensive, sophisticated and competitive capital market containing a range of intermediaries providing a diverse range of services. In this new environment, the Commission can see no need on economic grounds for government provision of financial services.Obviously, this conclusion applies equally to the Commonwealth Bank and supports the coalition position that the Commonwealth Bank should be sold off in total. There is also reason to question the Commonwealth governments continuing to guarantee liabilities. As a subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Development Bank should have no difficulty raising funds on the same terms as the other major trading banks. The benefits to the CDB of this guarantee are not substantial enough to justify the Commonwealths assumed liability. It is indicative of the governments lack of seriousness towards further privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank that it has not addressed these issues in the context of this bill.Indeed, the bill would seem to some extent to be at cross-purposes since it seeks to reduce the governments stake in the Commonwealth Bank while, at the same time, seeking to expand the Commonwealths involvement in its subsidiary, the Commonwealth Development Bank. This illustrates, I believe, the point I made earlier, that the government is a very reluctant privatiser.The government remains committed to majority ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. But we all know what has happened to the governments commitments on privatisation in the past. Eventually, the government will have to succumb to the inevitable and fully privatise the Commonwealth Bank. It will then have to work out what to do with the Commonwealth Development Bank since it seems unlikely that it would want to go on subsidising a subsidiary of a private bank. So this bill encapsulates many of the governments continuing privatisation dilemmas.As in so many cases, this government resorts to ad hockery. Its approach to the sale of shares in the Commonwealth Bank is but the latest example. Labor straddles the barbed wire fence because it cannot bring itself to come down on one side of the fence or the other. It could not bring itself down on the side of retaining public ownership, and it cannot bring itself down to completely privatise the bank. We can imagine the discomfort felt by ministers straddling that barbed wire fence merely because some among them cannot bring themselves to make the only sensible decision and sell the Commonwealths entire remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank to Australian investors. Straddling a barbed wire fence is an uncomfortable position to be in, I imagine, whether the straddler is an individual or a government.One likely outcome is that serious damage can occur to vital parts, as you can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker. Privatisation could take on a whole new meaning in some outcomes I can imagine. So long as the government continues to straddle the barbed wire fence on privatisation, its privatisation efforts will fall well short of the expectations and the interests of the Australian people. I move:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:(1)calls on the Government to proceed immediately to full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank; and(2)calls on the Government to ensure that the proposed changes to the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank will not lead to the Bank moving away from its current role as a lender of last resort.Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Fitzgibbon) —Is the amendment seconded?","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

175,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr JOHNS","JH4","(Petrie-","ALP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer)",1000,"—I am going to speak in favour of the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill and against the amendment which has just been moved by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). We understand already from the honourable member that the bill is about a further sale of Commonwealth Bank shares. I need to declare at the outset that I was a purchaser of a very small number of shares in the original share float of the Commonwealth Bank. In this instance the government has decided to sell down the Commonwealths shareholding of the bank to 50.1 per cent. The honourable member for Curtin made the allegation that the government is a reluctant privatiser. I think it is far more accurate to say it is a careful privatiser but it does not have an ideological position that is either for privatisation or against it.Certainly the government had an ideological position until recent years that it was against privatisation. It was a view in the Labor Party for many years that whatever enterprises the government owned it should hold on to them. We have certainly shifted our view on that. Now we have moved to a position which says, `Justify the governments role in running an enterprise. If you can justify it, hold on to it. So for us it is a position of choice rather than a position that one must privatise in all circumstances. We prefer a position which says, `Let us look at the circumstances of a particular industry or market and see whether there is a role for a public sector entity, whether fully owned, majority owned or part owned.I might return to an original reason for the Commonwealth Bank, which was established in 1911. The Commonwealth decided to establish a bank because there was very little order in the market, in the banking sector, at that time, and we felt that there ought to be a player who could act as an anchor to the commercial banking sector. Of course, the entire banking system has matured—I will come back to an illustration of that a little later in my remarks—and because the market for banking has changed and matured, it is reasonable then for the government to think again about the Commonwealth Banks own role in that new market for banking.There is a reason why we want to sell further shares in the Commonwealth Bank. It is not just because we think privatisation is a good or a bad thing. We are a cautious privatiser and we believe that there ought to be a decent rationale for any privatisation. The second reading amendment of the honourable member for Curtin states, in part:calls on the Government to proceed immediately to full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. . .The government is comfortable with a sell-down to 50.1 per cent where we maintain an interest in the Commonwealth Bank. We are grateful for the returns on those shares because they help us with whittling away our deficit over the next couple of years. We see no reason whatsoever to remove our role entirely in the Commonwealth Bank. The second reading amendment continues:calls on the Government to ensure that the proposed changes to the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank will not lead to the Bank moving away from its current role as a lender of last resort.We assure the honourable member for Curtin that these changes will not interfere with the development of the banks role as a lender of last resort. As he said in his speech, the government is injecting further funds into the Commonwealth Development Bank, so that small business and farmers, for instance, who cannot obtain loans from any other bank, can come to the development bank not just for a part of the loan, which they might have picked up in the commercial sector, but for the whole of the loan which could not be covered in the commercial sector. So it is true that we have strengthened the arm of the development bank and have now made it far more attractive to the business sector—small business and farmers—which often finds it difficult to get finance. I think I have more than adequately covered the honourable members amendment. The government cannot support it.In more general terms, just to explain the bill, on the basis of current share prices, the government expects to raise $1 1/2 billion from the sale of these shares, which will be a major contribution to the $2.4 billion which will help fund our deficit reduction strategy. However, it is important that there is an orderly strategy for privatisation. I remember that during the last federal election the opposition was very keen to sell the lot as quickly as possible. That would be a very stupid thing to do because if there is not going to be a decent return on the entity about to be sold, it is foolish to sell all at once. So the government is in no hurry to sell any shares of any particular Commonwealth entity until there is, firstly, a reason to sell and, secondly, a decent price for it.Once it has been decided that it is in the interests of the government and the people to sell some Commonwealth Bank shares, then comes the question of timing. Timing should be controlled by two factors: whether there is a good price for the shares and whether it is a good time to gain some money for the governments deficit reduction program. In our view this is a good time, so we brought forward this element of privatisation because it suits our interests at the time. We do not have an ideological view about either the timing or the number of sales. We have a practical view about what is in it for the Australian taxpayer. That has determined why these sales should go ahead at the moment.We do not have a view that says small government is good government, and that government ought to get out of all trading enterprises. We simply have a view that, if there is a mature market which does not require a government player, then the government can exit. But one has to make sure that there is a mature market, and we have done a great deal to the retail banking sector in the last couple of years to ensure that there is sufficient competition, decent dealings, and so on. Perhaps we are not there 100 per cent yet. We believe in efficient government rather than a particular size of government which, I would suggest, is a far more intelligent view of government to take.I predict—the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has said similar things—a very positive response to the first share float, the subsequent performance of which will prove to be very popular. At present the stock market is very high and very positive, as I noticed from my own shares in the Commonwealth Banks first sale of shares. The recent Woolworths float is indicative of the confidence investors are showing in well performing companies and in blue chip investments.I say to my own Labor Party members that they may need some review of why they have had such great regard for the Commonwealth Bank. Many Labor people saw it as the peoples bank. I do not think I ever saw it as such. I guess I had a more practical view of its purpose. But, certainly, the role of the Commonwealth Bank has changed over time. If it ever were a peoples bank, I do not think it performs that role at this time.The fact that there was a mythology surrounding the Commonwealth Bank means that some people in the community, especially in the Australian Labor Party, have had some difficulty coming to grips with the notion of the float of the Commonwealth Bank. Let me address the mythology and some of the misconceptions about the bank. Firstly, many people have seen the Commonwealth Bank as a necessity for injecting competition into the banking sector. While that is essential, there are other players in the banking sector—major Australian banks and the foreign banks operating in Australia—which, in addition to a strengthening financial sector such as building societies, credit unions and what are now called regional banks such as Metway, St George and the Bank of Queensland operating mainly in Queensland where my electorate is, means that we have a far more mature and competitive banking sector. So the Commonwealths role in that is less important than it was in 1924. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Bank will continue to play an important role in providing competition in the banking sector, but it will be able to play this role regardless of the level of public ownership. That does not affect the ability of the Commonwealth Bank to play a competitive role in the banking sector.Secondly, the Commonwealth Bank has been seen as the provider of lending for small business and home owners. It has to be appreciated that from about 1987 we have really let home mortgage interest rates float, as they do for any other form of loan. So the special rationale for the Commonwealth Bank has not existed for quite some time. But we do give a special tax exempt status to capital gains tax on the private home. So home loan lending is well looked after in that regard and there is no need for a special place for home mortgage lending.It should be kept in mind that the intense competition between the banks for home loan mortgages in the last few years has beaten the price of buying a mortgage down. Again, the market is maturing and it works reasonably well. That second rationale, if you like, is much less now than it once was.As to the small business community, we agree that there is a role for the banks and other financial communities in assisting the small business community, and that the Commonwealth Bank should not be called upon to lend on any more favourable terms than other financial institutions, other than for the remarks we have already made about the Commonwealth Development Bank. This is not to say that we do not keep an eagle eye open to the lending practices of commercial banks as they affect the small business sector. The Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) has addressed that issue a number of times. We have always said that we would like to see the small business sector get as good a bite at the cherry, at the finances, as any other business sector. But here the Commonwealth Bank need not play any special role; it once did, but it does not need to do anything special outside the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank.Sitting suspended from 6.31 to 8.00 p.m.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"
176,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr JOHNS","JH4","(Petrie-","ALP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer)",1000,"—Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I made the point that the honourable member for Curtin had accused the government of being a reluctant privatiser. As a cautious privatiser, we take the view that if the governments sale of a private enterprise is a reasonable thing to do in order to improve the operation of the market we will do it. If it is not a sensible thing to do to improve the operation of the market, then we will not do it.In this case, our view is that the Commonwealth would like to retain an interest—a powerful interest—in the Commonwealth Bank but not to completely sell down its shares in it. The reason for that is that, while we have a mature banking market, it is not totally as we would like it at this stage.I also made the point that there are people on our political side of life who regard the Commonwealth Bank as having had a special role, especially in assisting small business. Our view is that, apart from allowing the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank to continue—a section of the bank which we debated earlier tonight—if there is a need to give special assistance to the small business sector, then we should do it, and we should do it in a transparent and obvious manner.There are programs included in this budget such as the industry innovation program, the National Industry Extension Service and export service programs which are specifically targeted at that sector of the business community. They are practical, open and transparent. Their work does not need to be done through some other institution.I was explaining earlier that there was a particular rationale to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank but that things have since progressed. In its early period, the Commonwealth Bank played the role of an anchor for our banking system, with a central banking role being undertaken after 1924. At that time the Australian banking system was immature. There were very few national rules governing banking in the Australian banking market and it was sensible for the government to have a major player in the system at that time.The rationale for the Commonwealth Bank increased in the period leading up to World War II. During the Depression we saw the Commonwealth Bank given a major boost to its functions because at that time it was felt that the Commonwealth could use this mechanism in order to improve the Australian economy—that is, the Commonwealth Bank arm. We would not seek to do that today because we have so many other levers by which we seek to change the nature of the economy.In 1941 the Commonwealth Bank was given sweeping powers under the national security regulations. Again, there was a reason at that time for wanting to use the Commonwealth Bank in a particular way. However, things certainly began to change in the postwar period.In 1953 there was a push for the Commonwealth Bank to have its commercial operations split from its central banking role. Eventually, in 1957, legislation was presented that would have split the central role and the commercial arm of the Commonwealth Bank. The Labor Party at that time opposed the legislation. The legislation was re-presented in 1958 and was eventually passed in 1959, with the result that the Commonwealth Bank lost its central banking function and the Reserve Bank was created.It is only relatively recently that it has become clear that there are certain Reserve Bank functions on which the Commonwealth government relies for the control of monetary policy. We no longer rely on the Commonwealth Bank for other than its role as another player in the commercial lending market.To those who yearn for a 100 per cent government owned Commonwealth Bank, I would say that the rationale for that has long since passed. The government wishes to maintain a strong interest in the bank, but right now the time is right, and it suits the governments purposes, to sell down further shares in the bank and use some of that money as part of the deficit reduction program over the next four years.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
177,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr REID","VT4","(Bendigo)","LP","N/A",1003,"—The purpose of the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993 is to allow for reduction in the Commonwealth shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia from a minimum of 70 per cent to a minimum of 50.1 per cent; to allow for exemption from state and territory stamp duty and taxes the transfers and transactions related to the sale of Commonwealth shares in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia; and to allow the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to direct the Commonwealth Development Bank to issue the Commonwealth a specified number of shares in its capital in return for a payment and to provide for financial assistance grants to the Commonwealth Development Bank.By way of background to this bill, I inform the House that in February 1993, in its Investing in the nation statement, the federal government announced that it would sell down its shares in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to a minimum of 50.1 per cent while continuing to guarantee its liabilities, and that the sale would take place as a float to the general public in 1994-95. The Keating federal government expected to raise approximately $1.5 billion from the sale of the shares. However, in July 1993, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) announced that the sale would be brought forward to this financial year to offset the federal governments decision to postpone the Qantas float.In relation to the sale of Commonwealth equity in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the position of the coalition parties prior to the 1993 election was that once we were elected to govern we would legislate to allow 100 per cent private ownership of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The reasons we gave for advocating that 100 per cent private ownership included the fact that public flotation of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia would be more egalitarian and give the option for shares to all Australians. People who are familiar with the float of the first portion of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia would recognise that many Australians wanted to invest but were unable to take out the shareholdings that they desired to purchase.The coalition also believes that private ownership and having 100 per cent participation would improve the efficiency of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. It would lower costs to the community. It would improve services and competition. It would also provide the Commonwealth Bank of Australia with access to capital.With this legislation we are really revisiting the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill of 1990. In fact, the legislation before the House at the moment really served its incubation period in that bill. I recall contributing to the debate on that bill in this parliament in November 1990, going over some of the important issues at that time. Of course, at that time one of the most important issues was the Commonwealths decision to consolidate the State Bank of Victoria with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and I will come back to that point later.I want particularly to refer to the way this bill has been structured and the way the government has handled this matter. The government received plenty of advice from a large number of people in the community that it should go further than the initial share issue that it set out upon. It is not too far along the track now. In fact, in less than three years, we now have the government arriving at the same conclusion as that reached in the advice it received back in 1990, when people were advocating a greater private shareholding and public equity in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The government was particularly reluctant to take that step and it has now linked such a move with its deficit reduction strategy. But had the government moved at that time to a greater proportion of private ownership of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, it would have encouraged a great number of investors into the Commonwealth Bank who would have been able to give the Commonwealth Bank a much needed boost of funds, a rise in interest in the bank and a greater customer base than it perhaps presently has.In order to reflect on the governments lethargy in moving to a greater proportion of private investment in the Commonwealth Bank, it is necessary to understand the way the Australian Labor Partys philosophy differs from that of the Liberal-National coalition. For many years we have advocated that a greater number of Australians should be able to purchase shares in the Commonwealth Bank and spread that investment over the widest possible base in Australia so that everyone who was willing to buy shares had the opportunity to invest in what I believe is a very dynamic bank and one which the Australian community would want to take shares in.What happened to the State Bank of Victoria, and the pressure that was exerted on the State Bank of Victoria by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who was then the Treasurer of this nation, was tragic. He really forced the Cain-Kirner government into accepting what I believe was a very undervalued price for the assets of the State Bank of Victoria. During that period, the State Bank had 4 1/2 million account customers. It also had huge property assets—land and buildings—throughout the state. In fact, it touched every corner of the state of Victoria. Victoria was forced into that sale by the then Treasurer, and was forced to take what I believe was a very low figure of $1.6 billion.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

At the end of it all, Victoria was still left with much of the State Banks outstanding debt. I do not want to dwell on that, but I believe that it is important in considering the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank that people recognise that the Commonwealth Bank obtained the assets of the State Bank of Victoria at a very low price. Of course, that has enhanced the value of the Commonwealth Bank and its shares.I would also particularly like to mention the Commonwealth Development Bank, which is very important in providing finance for small business and particularly for rural pursuits. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and provides finance to small business where it would not otherwise be available on reasonable terms and conditions; in other words, it is a lender of last resort. I would trust that the government continue that role as laid out quite clearly in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. At clause 72, the first and primary objective of the development bank is stated as:(a) to provide finance for the purpose of establishing, acquiring or carrying on businesses (including businesses related to primary production), in particular small businesses, in cases where, in the opinion of the Development Bank, the provision of finance is desirable and the finance would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions;This is a very important aspect of the Commonwealth Development Bank for people from within my electorate, particularly in the rural sector and in small business, where they have recourse to the Commonwealth Development Bank for finance as a lender of last resort. Subclause 72(b) of the Commonwealth Banks Act further outlines the functions of the Development Bank:(b) in accordance with policies approved by the Treasurer, to participate in businesses of a kind referred to in paragraph (a) in cases where, in the opinion of the Development Bank, participation is desirable and other persons would not be prepared to participate on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions;That is where the Commonwealth Development Bank can be of great assistance to the rural community. The rural community, throughout my electorate, has had an extremely difficult time in the last three years. It has been subjected to adverse weather conditions and commodity prices have been low. Without continuing access to the funds of the Commonwealth Development Bank, it would be an even more difficult task for them. I ask the parliamentary secretary to take note of this because it is an important issue in rural areas.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

181,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr REID","VT4","(Bendigo)","LP","N/A",1003,"—I am pleased that the parliamentary secretary does agree with that because I was just a bit concerned with some of the comments that he made that there were other ways in which assistance could be provided to small business. I do not argue with him that there are many ways in which a government can assist small business and the rural community, but I would not like the government to minimise the importance of the Commonwealth Development Bank as a lender of last resort to small business and the rural community throughout Australia. Also under the functions of the Commonwealth Development Bank subclause 72(c) of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 states:(c) to provide advice and assistance with a view to promoting the efficient organization and conduct of businesses of a kind referred to in paragraph (a).It is in that area where Commonwealth Development Bank officers can be of great assistance to the rural community and also to small business by providing a wealth of information and knowledge not only of their own type of business activity, but also of comparable businesses throughout the state or even nationally. Officers of the Commonwealth Development Bank have been of tremendous assistance to members of the farming community by giving them financial advice, steering them in the correct direction and seeking to assist them in obtaining finance under the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank. Losing that assistance would be very detrimental to the rural community. I am certainly pleased to have the assurance from the parliamentary secretary that that is the governments intention. Needless to say, there are a number of other avenues, under small business affairs, in which the government can assist without removing the provision of that function from the Commonwealth Development Bank.I believe that under the bill there will be changes to the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank which will increase its capacity. There will still be a subsidy of $20 million per annum made available to the Commonwealth Development Bank, plus a capital injection of $30 million which will be provided by the government. I know that the government has set out to broaden the base of the Commonwealth Development Bank by enabling it to pick up the total borrowings of a client. Rather than have the borrowings by a client located at a number of financial institutions, the Commonwealth Development Bank sees some merit in having all the borrowings under one umbrella which it controls.This may well be the case, but I would not wish to see farmers or small business people treated detrimentally by this provision. I would still want them to have the flexibility, if they so chose, to have a range of people supplying them with their requirements in terms of loans and, perhaps, have it staggered over a period of years, rather than being forced to have all of their borrowing capacity under the one roof of the Commonwealth Development Bank. I presume that it is not the intention to try to force people to come under that umbrella purely and simply to obtain money from a lender of last resort such as the Commonwealth Development Bank. I hope that the government does not use muscle on people to try to force them all under the one umbrella. I hope that the government will enable people to still have a choice and enable them to choose exactly where they will obtain that finance. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has made notes about the comments that I have made. I would appreciate some response from him later in this debate.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
182,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CUNNINGHAM","0G4","(McMillan)","ALP","N/A",1006,"—It gives me pleasure to rise tonight in support of this legislation before the parliament as part of the budget process, and also as part of the economic strategy of the government. The Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill firstly facilitates a further sale of Commonwealth shares in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and secondly allows an expansion of the operations of the Commonwealth Development Bank. As part of the governments announcements in the Investing in the nation statement of 9 February 1993, the government said that it would be selling down its shareholding in the CBA from its present level of 70 per cent to 51 per cent. Prior to that time the CBA had been wholly owned by the Commonwealth.In that year the CBA was converted from a statutory authority into a publicly listed company. This is part of the overall strategy that the government has been developing over a considerable period in taking Australias financial structures into the world economy through a very modern and vibrant economic base. Since the Investing in the nation statement, the government has decided to bring forward the timing of the sale from 1994-95 to 1993-94. This decision certainly reflects the governments confidence that investors would welcome the opportunity to take up the CBA share issue. It also affects the governments decisions in relation to the budgetary impact of the postponement of the Qantas sale.In the overall structure that the government has been developing since 1983 for the nation of Australia, all of these decisions need to be taken in their context. The CBA is a very important national institution—one that has been in place for many years, and one that is very dear to the hearts of true believers of the Labor Party. We are certainly moving to new times. For the CBA to be efficient, these measures have been put in place to allow what was known as the governments bank to lead the way—not to follow—in relation to the restructuring of Australia. It is a very important decision, and one which will allow the CBA to have a much freer opportunity to compete with the other banks and show them the way in many cases as to how banks should operate in the new environment.On the current share prices the sale is expected to raise approximately $1.5 billion in revenue for the government. Hence, it is a very important part of the overall economic strategy. The government does expect strong demands for the shares, reflecting the current strengths of the stock market and favourable market judgments about the CBAs performance and prospects. We must also say that the markets are showing very favourable judgments in relation to the total package of this budget—an issue that has been raised at question time in the parliament today and one which will continue to be raised, I am sure, over the next couple of months.It is a tragedy in one way to see that, whilst for the last 10 years now this restructuring of Australias economy has been taking place, it appears that our opponents on the conservative side of parliament do not move with the times at all. They are not in a position to give an opinion in relation to this issue. They have filibustered in this House for the last two weeks since the budget was brought down, and having no control, or in collusion with their colleagues in the Senate, they are attempting to stall this budget in such a way that is doing enormous damage to Australias total future. It is also causing some concern out in the money market area in that normally we would expect a budget such as the one that we have produced to go through the House, and also through the Senate.As we have heard today on many occasions, particularly at question time, opposition members have ruled themselves out of this issue and they have raised the spectre of the minor parties in the Senate taking the running in relation to the economic issues. That is a real tragedy as far as Australia is concerned, and it is probably a great tragedy to the Liberal and National parties. It certainly would be of great concern to some of their supporters who must be cringing out in the community at the moment just watching what opposition members are doing in relation to the budget and to some of these measures.The area that I wish to concentrate some of my remarks on is the expanded role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. The Commonwealth Development Bank is a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of the CBA, and it is a very important economic factor in the business world of Australia. I did have the privilege many years ago before coming into parliament to have extensive dealings with the Commonwealth Development Bank—back in the days when the Whitlam government first proposed that the Commonwealth Development Bank should participate in the restructure of the rural sector in Australia, just after the United Kingdom virtually abandoned a lot of the Australian producers and said that it was turning its eyes to the EEC and we would have to find other markets. As one, at that stage prior to my parliamentary career, who had taken some economic decisions in relation to buying and developing a property, it was rather a shock to find that producers had been dumped by traditional buyers of our product and to find that we were at rock-bottom prices trying to survive and develop new markets for our produce. It was the Commonwealth Development Bank that came to the assistance of many people in the rural sector at that stage. Not only did it come to our assistance; it gave guidance and support in a way that was very instrumental in the restructure of much of the rural sector of Australia.Today we are seeing a similar situation where the Commonwealth Development Bank will play a very important role in the redevelopment of much of the small business sector of Australia. We have regional areas of Australia—and case after case is coming across my desk, as the chairman of the caucus subcommittee on regional development—where the banks still appear to be very reluctant to lend on business plans, on the ability of producers, on the ability of small business, and people are turning to the Commonwealth Development Bank. The measures that have been outlined by the government in the charter for this bank to provide finance and equity to small business will be very welcome, particularly when people are unable to obtain funding from other sources. Small and medium businesses in Australia and businesses which are large enough to be involved with the Commonwealth Banks charter will certainly welcome this piece of legislation.The CDB will be employing staff with specialist skills to assess the viability of small businesses and their prospects for success in their borrowing proposals. In order to be assisted by this new measure, they will need to put the business plans forward and to mount a solid case. The present bill permits a one-off $30 million capital injection to the CDB which will strengthen it so as to allow it to do the job expected by the government. The bill also permits a continuing subsidy of $20 million per annum to the bank and it amends the CDBs charter.These measures will allow the bank to assist the very strong move in many of the business areas of Australia to finally realise that the large number of imports into the country are now prime targets. The market established by those imports is still there. With the movements, the structures and the parameters now set in place within the financial structure of Australia, many businesses now recognise that they have an opportunity to push those exports back offshore again.In my electorate in the last 12 months there have been cases where business plans have been developed. Businesses have realised that the market opportunities are great—there has been enormous growth in some of those markets—provided that they can structure their business, redevelop their business and go after those markets. In order to do that they need development finance, which is where the Commonwealth Development Bank will play a very important role. This is why this government sees the Commonwealth Development Bank playing that important role in helping to restructure business and industry in Australia.When I listen to debates in this parliament and read some of the newspapers at times I get rather disappointed at the very negative approach that has been taken by so many of the people who were elected to this parliament. They are elected to lead. It is not only the Prime Minister who is out in front; it is all members of the parliament of Australia. I would expect that people on the conservative side of this parliament would at some stage start to take a lead and develop the confidence that Australia requires in order to take advantage of the opportunities that are offered. Those opportunities are not small; they are large and they are serious.In the budget debate last week I said that the parameters of Australias economy are such that we have never had a better opportunity in Australias history to have 20- and 30-year investment plans. The investors of the world are looking to this nation as one of the great stable areas where they can develop long-term plans for large investments in the markets of the future. I am sure that in that climate the Commonwealth Development Bank will play a major role.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

184,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CUNNINGHAM","0G4","(McMillan)","ALP","N/A",1006,"—The honourable member mentions the dollar. He can perhaps explain to the parliament why a dollar at 64c or 65c would be detrimental to our exporters. If he knows anything about economics he would know that there has never been a better chance for people to invest in Australia because we are more competitive now than we have ever been.In 1983-84 we were talking about 200 yen to the dollar. Today we are talking about 70 yen to the dollar. We had no chance in the early 1980s of competing against Japanese imports regardless of how efficient the Australian workers were. The workers of Australia used to be blamed as being overpaid. But it was impossible for us to compete with the rest of the world because our exchange rate at that stage was so out of kilter.The Japanese people today must be saying to themselves, `If I want to make an investment for the next 20 or 30 years, why would I build a new factory in an area that cannot compete against Australia? They are looking to Australia to develop their new factories of the future because this country has the basis for stable economy and stable government. This country has the basis for future investment.I would be very interested to hear the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) who interjected previously tell me why the present structures are not suitable for investment and why people who are in the position of competing with imports cannot do so. We have had a movement in the dollar of something like 30 per cent during this period of great debate about tariff reductions.Tariffs are nowhere near as good a support to the Australian economy as is the present valuation of our dollar on the world market. We are now very competitive—and we are in a position to take advantage of that. All this country needs now is the confidence, the ability and the training to go and do it. I am positive that we are putting the training programs in place to do that.I have been back in the parliament since March and, having spoken to members of the community, it is apparent that we need to concentrate more on some real training for managerial skills. Some of these industries can develop their industry plans in such a way that they can approach organisations such as the Commonwealth Development Bank in confidence. It is important that they do stipulate where their future is, where their market is, who the overseas competitor is that they intend to push out of that market, and explain their business plan in such a way that they can approach organisations such as the Commonwealth Development Bank.This government recognises this and has for a considerable time. I would call upon the members of the opposition also to start to recognise the reality of the situation and to show a little bit of confidence in the future of Australia so that when they speak on Commonwealth Bank bills, the budget bills and other matters in relation to the future of Australia they talk with a positive element.We can always look to the past and remember what happened. But Australia now must look forward. If we do not look forward, the opportunities might pass us by. It requires leadership, and not just from the government side. It is time that our conservative opponents recognised that those industries that have restructured and taken the lead are doing very well indeed.In my electorate I know for a fact that those rural sector people who have borrowed previously from the Commonwealth Bank and have built their new $50,000 rotary dairies today are walking around with the biggest smiles and driving the very latest four-wheel drives. Their economy is up and going and so are their communities. We need this to spread right through the community and for this to happen the community needs confidence. But above all, the business people need the opportunity and the management skills to recognise what they need to do to source the finance that the Commonwealth Development Bank will be able to provide to them. Opportunity knocks only once—and for Australia it knocked in the late 1950s and 1960s. We did develop, but we developed behind tariff walls. Today those tariff walls are gone. We are in a world economy and we have the opportunity to invest and develop again.I have one final plea to the opposition and that is for it to realise that it is part of Australia; it is part of the leadership of Australia for the people in the electorates, and it is time it faced up to reality. It lost the last election a few months ago. In three years time the people will judge the opposition on whether it participated in the redevelopment of Australia and they will penalise it severely if it continues down the path of its negative approach. Every day it continues with this negative approach, a former business supporter of the opposition will move to this side of the House, and that will continue.Those businesses in my electorate that have restructured and are doing very well appreciate what has happened. We need to restructure the more traditional older areas of the 1950s and 1960s in regional Australia and we need the support of organisations such as the Commonwealth Development Bank to take the lead. Business does want to get into it; business knows what it wants.The thing that comes through to me more than anything else is the absolute despair of so many businesses today with the banking system. No matter how hard they plead, they cannot break the banks away—having made lots of mistakes in the 1980s—from being so conservative that they will not lend even on what is considered to be a reasonable proposition based on skill, business planning and market opportunities. The Commonwealth Development Bank will show the way. This legislation will help. When we drag our opponents from the conservative side along with us, I am positive that in three years time we will not find the sorts of remarks coming from our opponents that we are hearing today. Even their supporters are saying, `Fellows we need leadership; we do not need to be dragged down. I strongly support the legislation.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

It has not dropped nearly as much as it will. The ultimate judgment on the government in Queensland was that we had a growth rate four times that of any other state in Australia. People voted with their feet when we were in government in Queensland—although they are not doing that now. The ultimate judgment by the world economy on a government is the value put on the currency. This currency dropped almost clean in half, from US95c, nearly a dollar—and, heaven only knows, it is falling.The honourable member was quite right in saying that there were 200 yen to the Australian dollar when his party was elected to parliament. Now that is down to about 65 yen. That gives some idea of how the value of our dollar has plummeted. He has congratulated himself and has said that this is a wonderful thing for Australia. That is a judgment on his country by the people of the world. That is their judgment on the Australian nation and its future.The dollar has not fallen—I certainly hope it has not fallen—nearly as far as it should have fallen. When it was allowed to free-fall it dropped like a stone from 95c to 59c. Then it was propped up by the Reserve Bank buying it and by artificially high interest rates. I will come back to interest rates in a moment. That was the judgment of the world on our economy. Enormously high interest rates were able to prop up the dollar, artificially hold it up, much to the detriment of the rural sector and export industries.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

189,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr KATTER","HX4","(Kennedy)","NP","N/A",1009,"—The Leader of the National Party is nodding his head. He continually makes this point well, and I congratulate him on it. Propping up the dollar was thieving from the people of the Kennedy electorate and cheating those people out of about $350 million a year. When the dollar was allowed to free-fall and it went to 59c our debt was about $40,000 million. The debt now is $200,000 million. So I leave it to the mathematics of honourable members to tell me to where it should fall, if it went to 59c when the debt was only $40,000 million and we had six per cent unemployment. We now have about 11 per cent unemployment and we are $200,000 million in debt. Obviously the dollar should be below 50c. The reason that it is not below 50c is that the Reserve Bank and the artificially high interest rates have been propping it up. That translates into a theft from the people of Kennedy—I am sorry, I made a mistake—of some $400 million per year.A cattleman in my electorate recently, having shot 200 of his young calves, shot himself. If people are committing suicide, being bankrupted and forced off their stations, falling over and losing everything they have worked for all their lives—two of my neighbours and I recently sold under those sorts of pressures—the problem can be placed fairly and squarely at the feet of the people sitting opposite. In a desperate panic, they propped up this dollar and in an attempt to look after I do not know who—but I suspect I know—they introduced an interest rate regimen of 20 per cent to 25 per cent. A lot of people went onto overdraft rates, onto figures of around 25 per cent, and then had a penalty of 2 1/2 per cent placed on them.There was no relief, consideration, help or assistance. They were left to fall over. In the whole of Australia last year it was reported that the RAS got around $54 million. The Queensland government gave that to the sugar industry in one year alone. So it is quite ridiculous to talk about RAS assistance; it does not exist.The QIDC was formulated by my government. When the head of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation did not do his job according to its charter we sacked him. But, unfortunately, we lost government soon after and the QIDC is now not available to the people of Queensland to rescue them from the terrible fate imposed on them by honourable members opposite.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

194,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr KATTER","HX4","(Kennedy)","NP","N/A",1009,"—Mr Speaker, I am sure that you realise that I am talking about an interest rate regimen of 25 per cent. The problem is a banking problem. That is exactly the same problem that occurred in 1930 when Ted Theodore, a very great Queenslander, was utterly destroyed and annihilated not only by his own party, the Labor Party, but also—I regret to say—by the people of Australia. The issue then was banking. He said that nobody was loaning to the production sector of the economy. He advocated a fiduciary issue in a desperate attempt to try to provide finance to all the people in Australia who were falling over. In sharp contrast, his Labor Party annihilated him and proceeded on a policy of restricting money supply in a most violent manner which produced the worst depression in the entire world.We had a 30 per cent unemployment rate, which was far higher than any other country. Britain hit only a 16 or 17 per cent unemployment rate and America went as high as 20 per cent but only for around one year or so during the Depression. We were at nearly 30 per cent for nearly five years. That was because of the stupidity and the towering ignorance of this party in government. In 1993 we have a bill that is doing exactly the same thing that occurred then.It was interesting to hear the honourable member for McMillan referring to the crash of the Australian dollar. We heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talking this morning about how he has controlled inflation. Yes, he has brought inflation down. There is no precedent for the drop in inflation in this country in the last two or three years, with the exception of 1929 and 1930. The opposite of inflation is depression. Just as Mr Theodore was able to grasp that fact and was destroyed by the intellectual pygmies around him in the Labor Party at the time, we see a replica of the conditions, attitudes, policies and intellectual capacity of the Labor Party being repeated and inflicted on this nation.I turn to the banking bill that is before us. In the year the much maligned McEwen policies ceased to exist and when we lost government to the ALP in the Whitlam period there were a little over 2,000 bankruptcies in Australia. When the Labor Party took government in this country in 1983 there were a little over 4,000 bankruptcies. Last year there were 16,800. That had grown hugely from the year before when there were about 13,400 bankruptcies, if my memory serves me correctly. There were 30,000 bankruptcies in two years.Very few people take technical bankruptcies. It is said that for every bankruptcy between 15 and 25 businesses go broke. I leave to your imagination, Mr Speaker, how many businesses in Australia have fallen over in the last four or five years. More than any other factor, that regimen of interest rates persecuted those people without mercy and without precedent in Australian history. Those people were destroyed by those interest rates. I will bet that if every person in my electorate who has gone broke over the last six years were to limit it to a single factor they would say that they went broke as a result of those interest rates.We had three possibilities for assistance in Queensland. We sacked the head of the QIDC bank in our state. The charter of that bank was to help those people and to try to move away from interest rates of 25 per cent. Unfortunately, we lost government soon afterwards. QIDC immediately went to commercial lending rates and commercial policies. So it was cut off completely as a form of assistance to the small business and farming sectors of Queensland. We had RAS. As I said, the subsidies payable and the RAS amount allocated to Queensland would not subsidise the interest rates—I actually worked the figures out—payable to the shires of Richmond, Hughenden and Julia Creek, just three out of some 20 or 30 shires in my electorate. So it is a very bad joke.Left to us was the Commonwealth Development Bank. A lot of people on my side of the House, and it appears everyone on that side of the House, think that the way we are moving here by selling off the Commonwealth Development Bank is terrible.

Lang and Ted Theodore would turn in their graves—they would be sick—at what is happening here today.One great mechanism that the government of Australia had to control the economy of Australia—the Commonwealth Bank—is being privatised, commercialised and gotten rid of. The mechanism that we need to be able to operate and influence the economy of Australia has been restricted yet again. We gave away the value and control of the dollar. Maybe that was a good thing; I do not know. I could put up an argument that it is a good thing. But what is happening here today runs counter to the history and the philosophy of so many of the great leaders of the Labor Party. Every single one of them was martyred by the Labor Party itself. I do not know how many martyrs have been cast aside to bring this piece of rubbish into the House this evening.The privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank not only restricts the access of our small businesses that are falling over, our developmental businesses that so desperately need the finance, but also restricts the farming sector that is in such a desperate plight through absolutely no fault of its own. It is a great tragedy in Australia today that a dozen or two dozen speculators were allowed to run rampant by this so-called government. By the time the dust had settled, $70,000 million, according to a Bulletin article, had been lost from the Australian economy, and the $70,000 million had been spent by those people for no better purpose than to play monopoly with each other. The people responsible for that are those in the government of Australia—those people sitting over there. They cost this nation and allowed these people to get away with $70,000 million.What do we do now? The banks are in desperate trouble. They loaned all this money to these great, wise and wonderful people—the commercial priorities which have worked so magnificently well! We have turned these banks over to them and they have run them so marvellously well! What did we do? We had to put the whips to the backs of the galley slaves, to the farming and small business sector. We had to jack the interest rates up to 20 per cent to make up for the Mr Holmes a Courts, the Mr Alan Bonds and all of the other high flying speculators that took this country to the cleaners. We had to put the whips to the backs of the galley slaves. Many of those galley slaves are broken men today. When you lose your business it is not like losing your job. If you lose your job, you still have an income and can hold on to your house and car. When you lose your business you are left owing money; so your car and house go and you are left with a debt and no life at all. Every single thing that you have worked for all your life is taken from you and you are thrown out onto the scrap heap in such a way that you will never be able to recover.Thirty thousand Australian families went technically bankrupt. I do not think anyone in this House would question the fact that more than 10 businesses go broke for everyone that goes bankrupt. We are talking about 300,000 Australian families in the last three years. These are not my figures but figures put out by the government sitting opposite us this evening.The Commonwealth Development Bank has the only money available in Queensland. I cannot speak with authority for the other states of Australia. There is no doubt in my mind that tonight we are seeing a push towards the commercialisation of not only the Commonwealth Bank itself but also the Commonwealth Development Bank. There is no doubt that the ramifications of the way in which we are proceeding this evening—no matter what assurances we are given and no matter what is written into the charter, because all of those things were written into the charter of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation—are that we will be starved of that money in exactly the same way as the people of Australia were starved of that money. When that great Australian—I do not hesitate to call him a great Australian—Ted Theodore sacrificed himself and his political life to try to give to those people the finance they needed to survive, he was destroyed, the finance was not given to them and the worst tragedy of any country in the whole world was occasioned upon the Australian people. Exactly the same thing is occurring today.Average farm incomes dropped from $27,860 in 1980 down to $9,133 in 1991. Those figures were made available to me by the Parliamentary Library. So those people are living very high on the hog on $9,000 income. I will not go sideways and talk tonight about the destruction of the wool industry, which is exclusively the result of the Prime Minister of Australia—the Treasurer as he was then. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind—I am quite happy to argue on any platform anywhere any time—that that can be laid at the feet of the then Treasurer of Australia.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

He has robbed and deprived the Australian fighters, battlers and risk takers—the people who have had the guts to get out there and have a go—of the finances to stay alive. He has wrecked the lives of 300,000 of them just in the last two years alone.

197,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr PRICE","QI4","(Chifley)","ALP","N/A",1013,"—I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you and I and a couple of other members have been privileged to witness one of the most amazing speeches that I have certainly listened to in about nine years. I would like to take up some of the issues raised by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), but I think we ought to remind ourselves of what is happening to the Commonwealth Development Bank.The honourable member for Kennedy said that this is a pernicious bill that is going to privatise the Commonwealth Development Bank, and that Theodore would turn over in his grave. I want to compliment the honourable member for Kennedy for his kind remarks about Red Ted Theodore; I agree with them. I seem to recall from history that it was opposition coalition members who were screaming for the royal commission that was the ultimate undoing of Red Ted Theodore. Be that as it may, I certainly agree that he was a great Australian.It is most dishonest, mischievous and misleading for the honourable member for Kennedy to suggest to this parliament that the purpose of this bill is to privatise the Commonwealth Development Bank. Instead, the bill is increasing the ability—admittedly limited—of the Commonwealth Development Bank to respond in its role as lender of last resort to small business and to farmers. It is getting a capital injection of $30 million. Not once did the honourable member for Kennedy mention that. The Commonwealth Development Bank is getting a subsidy of $20 million so that it can take greater risks as a lender of last resort to those small businesses. Why did the honourable member for Kennedy not have the integrity and honesty to say that to the parliament? Why is he attempting to mislead the people of Australia in such a deliberate way?I was amazed by a lot of the things said by the honourable member for Kennedy. He said that high interest rates caused bankruptcies. There is no doubt about the fact that when interest rates went up to 20 per cent, 21 per cent and 22 per cent it put enormous pressure on businesses and farmers. But those are not the current interest rates. It is not appropriate, it is not accurate, it is not honest to suggest that bankruptcies today are being caused by an interest regime of yesterday. In fact, if the honourable member for Kennedy talks to his small and medium businesses, he will find that they are able to renegotiate their loans at much more reasonable rates of interest. That makes a big difference to those firms and organisations.The honourable member for Kennedy spoke with pride about his government—the failed National Party government—in Queensland. I should remind the House that the Fitzgerald royal commission—not Labor members on this side of the House, and not Labor members of the Queensland parliament—found the Queensland National Party government to be the most corrupt of any State government in Australia.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

203,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr PRICE","QI4","(Chifley)","ALP","N/A",1013,"—No-one can question the probity of the Commonwealth Bank. One of the reasons we are bringing this bill forward is that the Commonwealth Bank has absorbed the State Bank of Victoria. I would have thought that members opposite would welcome the fact that the State Bank of Victoria is not going to go out of existence; that, notwithstanding the Tricontinental episode—and I will join with honourable members opposite in saying that it was an unfortunate event in history—that bank did not collapse. The depositors did not lose any money. The Commonwealth Bank has taken it over and I think that is a good thing. For that reason, we have sold down our equity in the Commonwealth Bank, but we will still have a 50 per cent interest—as we should—in the Commonwealth Bank.I could keep going on about the provocative remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy. Perhaps he would be pleased to know that I would like to move on. Some remarks made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) call for a response. He suggested that the introduction of this bill represented a failure by the government; that, because we have brought forward this sell down and delayed the sale of Qantas-Australian, this was a colossal failure by the government. Members opposite, and particularly the honourable member for Curtin, get very sanctimonious about taxpayers money; how we should be careful with it and how we are not taking enough care. But it appears from his remarks that he is quite happy to sell Qantas-Australian in a depressed aviation market. The honourable member for Curtin cares not one fig that the Commonwealth—and because it is the Commonwealth, the taxpayers of Australia—would literally be losing millions of dollars of value.I thought the government took a very sensible and brave decision in merging Australian Airlines with Qantas Airways. We do not have to have very much understanding of business to appreciate that in any merger situation it takes some time before the organisation is settled down, and different operating systems, inventory systems, et cetera are worked out. It is a weak aviation market. Why would we want to give away the airline? I suppose the answer is that those opposite are ideologues, and they will not hesitate to privatise anything—whether they preserve the Commonwealths money in the taxpayers interest, or whether they throw it away, as indeed they do.I will give another example of the oppositions irresponsible approach. At the last election it wanted to completely privatise Telecom-AOTC—a $20 billion organisation. We must remember that the marketplace had only ever raised $9 billion a year in new raisings, and yet the opposition was going to throw $20 billion onto the marketplace.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe that one of the difficulties for governments—whether they be Liberal, conservative or Labor—is the fact that we are sometimes not the most prudent shareholders. We sometimes do not make sure that capital adequacy is appropriate, or even comparable by other standards. I think that is what is so offensive about the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy. This capital raising deals with this problem for the Commonwealth Bank as a whole, and especially for the Commonwealth Development Bank, which is having a capital injection of some $30 million. It is also receiving an interest rate subsidy of $20 million a year. This will help the very people that the honourable member for Kennedy is talking about. We ought to object to the suggestion by the honourable member for Kennedy that all small rural business or all farmers are always going to need subsidised assistance.I do not think that is the case. I would agree with the honourable member for Kennedy, and those on my side of the House as well as on the other, who suggest that the farming community is amongst the most efficient in the world. I am not trying to suggest that this bill enables it, but I would love to speak on a bill that looked at the way in which we can get rural enterprises going to get farmers up and running in a much healthier way to stop some of that population drift from rural and regional Australia. I happen to think that is a very important issue.I return to the bill. The Commonwealth Development Bank has a charter to operate as a lender of last resort. So once someone has been to all the other banks or financial institutions and been knocked back, he or she can present a proposal to the Commonwealth Development Bank—","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start[6]/para","N/A","N/A"

I point out that it was not my intention to do so. I want to get back to the bill as it is an important one. A lot of Australians are rightly proud of, and take a great deal of interest in, the Commonwealth Bank and they will be interested to know exactly what is happening with their shareholding.When this government actually put the shares on the market it rewrote the rules in terms of attracting the mums and dads of Australia as shareholders. In fact, many people became shareholders for the first time. If one were to reflect on the first float of shares, I think a reasonable argument could be mounted that we underestimated the response quite dramatically. Hopefully, in this further pull-down of Commonwealth shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank there will be greater opportunities for ordinary citizens to make a purchase of shares.We on this side of the House do not have a manic approach to privatisation, nor even to competition or deregulation. We try to treat each case as it arises. In this case, I am personally pleased that we are retaining a majority shareholding. Some of us on this side, and maybe some honourable members on the other side, would like to see a more interventionist role given that major shareholding; but the facts are that we appoint boards of directors with a fiduciary duty to operate the bank. As honourable members have said in the past, it should not be run on commercial lines.I want to finish on this note: I do not really think we have solved all the financing problems for business, particularly small business. As I have said before, it is true that interest rates have come down quite significantly. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicates, I still think we are not looking sufficiently at cash flow as an element of lending policy. I welcome any move by the major banks towards a more sympathetic approach to lending, particularly to small and medium business, because on this side at least we think that is the challenge in terms of firing up the economy even more.When I talk with banks about their lending policies, they are the first ones to admit that they get presented with quite a number of good proposals which their corporate lending policies require them to knock back. I would be naive if I thought the Commonwealth Development Bank could pick up each and every one of them, but I sincerely hope that in the future we will be able to see some change as far as the major banks lending policies are concerned. I fully support this measure.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start[11]/para","N/A","N/A"
219,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr GEAR","QG4","(Canning-","ALP","Assistant Treasurer)",1016,"—I would like to thank everybody who took part in the debate today on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill. Unfortunately, I did not have the privilege of listening to all of them—although I did catch the tail end of the speech by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and I will come back to part of his contribution later. I am told that the debate has been wide ranging and that many of the points raised by opposition members have been more than adequately answered by members of the government.One point I think needs a bit of clarification. It was said that partial privatisation may put directors in a difficult position and that is bad for the bank. The government does not interfere with the day-to-day running of the bank, as was stated clearly in the 1991 prospectus for the CBA float.The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has moved an amendment to this bill, firstly calling on the government to proceed immediately to full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. The simple fact is that the government firmly believes that having at least 50 per cent of one of Australias major banks in public hands does raise the standard of prudential control and customer service. We have no intention of further selling down our shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank.The second part of the amendment calls on the government to ensure that the proposed changes to the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank will not lead to the bank moving away from its current role as a lender of last resort. That will not happen. The simple fact is that we are injecting another $30 million worth of capital into this Commonwealth Development Bank, and we will give it an extra $20 million subsidy in recognition that the bank will face higher risk. This will help it expand its lending base to small business and the rural sector.As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, I heard evidence quite often around Australia about the fact that small business and the rural sector were quite concerned about the banks lending for those sectors. The step we are taking tonight in terms of the Commonwealth Development Bank will go some way towards allaying those fears and concerns raised before the committee. In fact, the CDBs charter is not being expanded beyond its current role as a lender of last resort, but the amended charter will enable the CDB to continue to provide funds to businesses which would not otherwise be able to obtain funds from other sources. More importantly, it will allow the CDB to lend the full amount rather than the partial amount as in the past.As I said earlier, I came in when the honourable member for Kennedy was speaking. Had he taken the time to actually read the bill, he would have understood that we are not selling off the CDB, as I believe he indicated in parts of his speech; we are retaining it in government control. As I said before, we are injecting it with $30 million worth of capital and a $20 million subsidy to recognise the higher risks it may face in terms of its lending into the future. Once again, I would like to thank all honourable members who participated in the debate on this bill. I fully support it.Question put:That the words proposed to be omitted ( Mr Rochers amendment) stand part of the questionOriginal question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BANKS AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

240,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ANDREWS","HK5","(Menzies)","LP","N/A",1020,"—This is a budget of which Lewis Carroll would have been proud. It takes us into a looking glass world where everything is not what it seems. Honourable members should cast their minds back to the conversation between Alice and Humpty Dumpty in Through the Looking Glass . Humpty, who is a bad-tempered egg, begins, `Theres glory for you!. `I dont know what you mean by glory, Alice said. Humpty said, `I meant theres a nice knockdown argument for you. `But glory doesnt mean a nice knockdown argument, Alice objected. `When I use a word, Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, `it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.`When I use a word, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is telling us in this budget, `it means exactly what I choose it to mean. So a deficit reduction strategy is one which actually increases the deficit; a budget about jobs actually predicts higher unemployment; a `fair budget makes the poorer people in the community pay more to tank up their old cars while slashing the price of luxury vehicles; and a `decent budget slugs the unemployed and the elderly with a raft of indirect taxes while giving high income earners non-income tested child-care cash rebates.`Words mean what I choose them to mean, says the Treasurer, our Humpty Dumpty Dawkins. I note that the Treasurer entitled his budget `Prudence. He could have easily called it Molly, Maude or Mandy. It would have been equally meaningless. But the title `Prudence reminds me of the essay, `Prudence, by Emmerson, who wrote:Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar, but is a stab at the heart of human society.Australia has received a stab in its vital organs from this incompetent and tired government. It has just missed the carotid artery but the nation is surely bleeding. This country cries out for solutions to unemployment, our huge overseas debt, our inability to save and our failure to invest, but all we get are tricks with mirrors.The Australian people have been tricked. It was instructive that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) after his election told the Australian people that he would tell the truth and not gild the lily. Given his performance since then I can only assume that the only lilies around Parliament House are of the plastic variety. It struck me as remarkable that the Prime Minister of this country should feel the need to promise to tell the truth in his first remarks to the people of Australia. One might imply from this an acknowledgment that he had not always done so in the past. The public might be forgiven for reading into this an admission that truth has not always been one of the hallmarks of the Prime Minister to an extent that is breathtaking even in politics.Our Prime Minister is, in more than one way, a renaissance man, and I am not talking about his antique clock collection or his reported knowledge of classical music. He epitomises the princes of power that Machiavelli, now a by-word for political trickery, described and advised in his famous booklet, The Prince , written in 1513. Machiavelli wrote in a section headed, `How princes should keep their word, the following:How praiseworthy it is for a prince to keep his word and live with integrity rather than by craftiness, everyone understands; yet we see from recent experience that those princes have accomplished most who paid little heed to keeping their promises, but who knew how craftily to manipulate the minds of men. In the end, they won out over those who tried to act honestly.The Prime Minister told us on election night that he would take the unemployed with him. He did not, however, say where. He must have had the Pied Piper in mind. If honourable members recall, all the children of Hamlin followed the piper into the sea along with the rats. This budget gave no hope to the unemployed. Nor did it give any hope to anyone else.I know our Prime Minister likes to use the broad brushstroke. This is all very well if one is talking about Fred Williams or Arthur Streeton but not when one is talking about government. I suspect the Prime Minister is a Fauve at heart. I, as a lawyer, prefer to examine the fine print. One finds all the tricks hidden in the fine print. So let us just examine the fine print in this Labor budget.This was supposed to be a budget about getting our big international bankcard debt down. That is surely something even the press gang on the governments back benches can understand. The incredible shrinking deficit is estimated by the Treasurer in his budget address to be $13.4 billion for 1992-93. But when it is adjusted for windfalls, such as asset sales and dividends, we find that the deficit will be more than $20 billion. So the Treasurer has painted out of the budget almost $7 billion of deficit. It is a nice exercise in creative accounting but it does not do a thing for actually reducing the deficit of this country.This budget has sheeted home to the public and to its own caucus the hollowness of the governments beliefs in social equity. At the last election the Prime Minister fulminated against the goods and services tax because it was supposed to be regressive. The GST would have raised $2 billion in indirect taxes. But with these latest measures in this budget, the Labor Prime Minister will have raised indirect taxes to $3 billion. Let us consider that for a moment—ordinary Australians will be paying $3 billion in indirect taxes a year. The coalition tried to warn the public of the way in which the Labor government has over the past 10 years increased its wholesale sales tax net without any of the compensations that were written into our package.Of course, the Prime Minister continually bleats that we are one of the lowest—according to him, soon to be the lowest—taxing countries in the OECD. The man and woman in the street know that this is simply not the case. According to the National Tax Agents Association, Australias average taxpayer on $27,000 per annum pays 50 to 59 per cent of earnings in direct and indirect taxes. The association says that Australias indirect taxes are `a fraud of monumental proportions.The model used by the Tax Agents Association has been supported by the Taxation Institute of Australia. Other analysts put the figure closer to 50 per cent but, even so, this is abundant proof that we are not the low taxing country in the world the government would like to convince us that we are, contrary to the evidence of our own wallets.These hidden taxes are in our gas bills, telephone bills and mortgages, because companies, utilities, banks and other services pass on these taxes to us, the consumers. The Tax Institute says that an average 32c in every dollar is spent on hidden taxes.The total cost to taxpayers of taxes at the federal, state and local government level is $122 million. That represents a cost of $15,844 for each of Australias 7.7 million taxpayers. With true looking glass logic, the Treasurer taxes the socks off us while declaring that we are hardly taxed at all.Average Australians are now paying in indirect taxes almost what only the very wealthy paid in direct taxes under the Fraser government—that is, 60 per cent. For example, a single working mother earning $31,744, including child support, pays $6,524 in direct tax and some $6,750 in indirect tax. An apprentice earning $12,000 a year pays only $1,652 in direct tax but some $2,456 in indirect taxes.The wealthy have done tremendously well under this government at the expense of ordinary Australians. But beware. Whenever Labors left and the ACTU call for taxes on the wealthy, they are really talking about middle Australia. It is one nation for the rich and another for the poor and middling. According to the Tax Institute of Australia, wage earners on $20,700 per annum will be $92 a week worse off, while those on $50,000 will be $616 in the black. The governments child-care cash rebates announced in the budget will benefit the well-to-do dual income families because they are not income tested.Single income families and single parents have been the biggest losers in the distribution of income during the 1980s. In the past four years, there has been a near doubling in the number of married couple families, including those in de facto partnerships, where one or both partners are now unemployed. The number of those families rose from 154,000 to 327,500 in June this year. That is 327,000 families where neither of the partners are employed.Meanwhile, if people are thinking about buying a car priced from $50,000 to $100,000, this rich mans Labor budget brings them a windfall. Changes to the luxury car tax formula means that cars which cost as much as some peoples houses will be $4,000 cheaper. A Ford LTD will come down to a bargain basement $57,530—but at least it is Australian made.On the other hand, the amusements dear to the working man—the usual smokes and petrol—are being slugged hard. While smoking is an unhealthy and unnecessary addiction, petrol is one of the necessities of modern life, particularly in Australia. By increasing the surcharges on leaded petrol, the government only increases an intolerable burden on those who can least afford to pay it.Of course, in a better and greener world we could all drive LTDs and BMWs, which take unleaded petrol. The governments defence—that we pay comparatively little for petrol by world standards—should be set against what Geoffrey Blainey dubbed `the tyranny of distance which has ruled our history. In our vast land we need to carry our supplies across distances unknown except in the old USSR. The whole of Britain could be contained in the state of Victoria. These petrol hikes will add to the indirect impost on all our goods and services, including food. The budget mark 1 is also proposing to do away with Medicare rebates for optometry, but it seems that the serried ranks of caucus have caused this conscienceless government of desperados to back down on that issue.Students have been particularly targeted by the Labor government. They will have to repay their HECS debt faster and there is a lower salary threshold before repayments start. Those taking more than the minimum time to complete their courses—a mere one semester more—will be penalised. According to some university authorities, this will affect around 80 per cent of Australian higher education students.The government has trumpeted a new postgraduate award scheme with more than 20,000 places being made available next year. This is misleading because it actually only involves the merging of two existing schemes. The budget also doubles HECS charges for students doing second undergraduate degree courses at the same or higher level, which is a fascinating comment on the governments idea of a clever country. If anyone is to be particularly clever in Australia, it is going to be at his or her own expense.This last measure is expected to put a stop to the spectacular growth of distance education for up to 40 per cent of external students who already have degrees. This is nothing more than a tax on knowledge and skilling and would lift the cost of a degree course to around $5,000 on average.The government is also taking 16-year-old secondary students off Austudy and paying them through the family payments apparatus which, with its lower threshold for both income and assets, will effectively remove many who would currently receive Austudy. The government is tightening up eligibility and therefore expects to save some $51 million from the budget of the Department of Employment, Education and Training in 1993-94. That will be at the expense of many rural students who live at home because the Austudy assets test allowed them to have twice the limit of the normal assets test.The extra $3 million allocated in the budget for research infrastructure has been rightly condemned by the academic establishment as simply paltry. Academics had expected better things because the government had spent half a million dollars commissioning a report into the subject which recommended that university research infrastructure needed an extra $120 million a year—40 times more than the government is offering now. The government might at least have saved the money that it spent on the report.Two years after the International Year of Literacy, the government is welching on adult literacy programs. By transferring literacy funding to labour market programs, the government expects to save $7 million in 1993-94, rising to $14.5 million in 1996-97. By re-routing the program through social security, which lacks expertise or judgment in this area, the government is tying subsidisation of adult literacy group programs to all but those on jobstart.According to the small number of literacy education providers, this will mean that people in isolated areas will have to wait longer for, and will have less access to, programs because it will not be economically viable without the other people who are not on jobstart and who now participate in these programs. One would think that they are disadvantaged enough by having literacy problems in the first place. Such an exercise is nothing more than penny-pinching by the government and demonstrates no regard for its much vaunted concern for social justice.It is supposed to be the first sign of madness when one thinks that it is everyone else who is mad. The Bible tells us to first examine the mote in our own eye. The Prime Minister has called the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) `a wrecker and a vandal. He has called the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, `psychotic. He has said that the Australian Democrats are trying to set an undemocratic precedent. In Jungian psychology, this is described as projecting the shadow in oneself. It happens whenever people search for scapegoats to excuse their own failings. The Nazis did it when they fixed on the Jews as the authors of Germanys troubles.Might it not be that it is the Prime Minister who is the vandal and the wrecker, the psychotic, the destroyer of democratic safeguards? In this place we become used to intemperate abuse from the Prime Minister. Perhaps we should see it as symptomatic of the psychological malaise which lies at the heart of this government. I warn the Prime Minister that what goes around comes around. `The question is, said Alice, `whether you can make words mean so many different things. `The question is, said Humpty Dumpty, `which is to be master—thats all.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1993-94","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

245,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ADAMS","BV5","(Lyons)","ALP","N/A",1023,"—That could be a fairytale on the part of the honourable member for Bennelong as well. The honourable member is interjecting out of his seat, which I understand is not in accord with the standing orders. It is a shame he will not stay and listen, but I do commend the honourable member for Menzies as his speech was different from a lot of the normal speeches in here. I support the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1993-94 and oppose the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge).The overall budget philosophy and strategy is to reduce the deficit to $1.2 billion by 1996-97. That seems to satisfy most of those in the marketplace and those that comment on fiscal responsibility in this country. One has to go back slightly, to 1989-90, to see some of the ideas that helped formulate this budget and the direction we went in. At that time, the economy was going into decline, GDP growth was negative and private sector investment had slowed right down. Unemployment had begun to rise and there was a need to look at where we were going from the publics perspective. There were 13 interest rate reductions between January 1990 and July 1992. Although that was a stimulus to the economy, it was not enough. The last government introduced the One Nation package to pump prime the economy; to put some money into the economy and to give it the stimulus that it needed. I believe that the effects of that are still flowing through into our economy now.If we look at the big picture of this budget, we see that the $2 billion tax cuts are of the same magnitude as that One Nation stimulus. Two billion dollars will go into the economy as a result of the tax cuts in this budget. That brings our budget deficit in the medium term, 1996-97, back to 1.2 per cent. Putting this money into the economy has to be a good kick along for it. It means more activity and more jobs, and the improvement will go right through to more housing. I would like to come back to interest rates in a short time. I believe that it is appropriate at this time that we kick the economy along; and most of the commentaries that I have been reading indicate that there has been some turnaround. In the Age last Tuesday, its economic editor stated:Australia has been handed a triple dose of good economic news. Long-term unemployment is falling, the building recovery is still alive and kicking, and the current account deficit in July was less than expected.There has been a turnaround in that long-term jobless situation. An industry brief from the Bureau of Industry Economics came across my desk, entitled `Manufacturing sector: August 1993. The first article `A sustainable recovery for manufacturing?, states:Recently-released data provide evidence that the manufacturing sector has emerged from recession and is beginning to grow. Production rose for the third consecutive quarter in the March quarter, and profits increased sharply. Moreover, part-time employment rose strongly in the June quarter, suggesting that the recent growth in production has continued.All the commentators in Australia are talking about some activity; it might be small, but the economy is beginning to move. Recent figures from the Bureau of Statistics on the labour force indicate that trend as well. Although the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) indicated the other day that those figures needed to be looked at in some detail, he also said they were not necessarily good figures for deep analysis. However, they do show that long-term unemployment—which totalled 334,000 in July—was down by 36,000 from last March. That has again been reinforced today in the Age . The article entitled `Job ads signal an end to woes states:Evidence is mounting that the worst unemployment in 60 years is coming to an end. The ANZ Bank yesterday reported that job advertisements grew again in August, and are now running 16 per cent above last years levels.I believe that some of that effect, especially on long-term unemployment, has been the result of some of the labour market programs introduced by this government and which are very prominent in this budget. Those programs offer opportunities for us to foster further links between industry, training and education, and to build on the strength of our nations skill base.One such program is the community activity program to help unemployed people gain work experience and learn new skills in the community sector. It is only a new program, but I believe it has the potential to help the community sector. There has been a doubling in the expenditure in jobclubs, jobskills, jobstart and LEAP for unemployed people aged from 15 to 19 years. Fifty per cent of those places are to go to the long-term unemployed. They are positive programs which assist the unemployed, and especially the long-term unemployed.The new enterprise initiative scheme will assist people to get into their own business. If a person has been unemployed for some time and wishes to start his or her own business, there is assistance from this government to help them do so. Of course, there have already been many people able to take advantage of that program. This shows the commitment of this government to addressing the problem of unemployment and long-term unemployment. I believe this budget has set the major parameters. With inflation at 1.9 per cent and interest rates well down, industry and business certainly have the opportunity to borrow money to expand, to go into new ventures and to generally stimulate activity. Housing interest rates of 9.5 per cent in the July quarter also provide another opportunity for the housing market to continue to expand.I believe business has an important role to play and should create some growth within our economy. Governments can only do so much. A government cannot create one million jobs, and it is unreasonable to ask the government to do that. The President of the ACTU last week berated business for its lack of thrust. I think his concerns were based on some of the criticisms that I hear from the other side of this House. Those honourable members opposite constantly harp about government, organised labour, consumer groups and others. I believe that business should certainly have a look at its own performance and, if it needs help in that area, I am sure that we could come up with some programs to assist it in its training programs because I think some management in Australia certainly needs to be brought into the 1990s.We can export more and we can perform better. As I said, low interest rates and low inflation give us the opportunity to do that. There have been many instances of Australias organised labour increasing productivity by going into more flexible working conditions. I heard the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), in answering a question today, say how over 1,000 enterprise bargains have been struck. I certainly hope that they increase productivity, as I am sure that those workers in those industries have given up something to gain more flexibility with the aim of increasing productivity. I believe business has to do its share. In the Age today, Mr Fox, a trucking magnate, said that Australians needed to `get off their backsides and take responsibility for providing jobs for the countrys youth. Mr Fox is the joint leader of the work for Australia youth jobs campaign, and I think he is quite right.Some years ago I remember that some housing interest rates were locked in at 13 per cent and others had gone out to 18 per cent, 19 per cent and even higher. They are now at eight per cent or nine per cent. Rates like that—and some banks will offer even down to six per cent to gain business—also have to be good for the housing market. It allows people to get into housing and so encourages housing activity to take place. I believe that housing will play a major part in our recovery, and that housing and construction have a bigger role to play in export earnings for Australia. In the future, through services and construction skills, housing and construction will be more able to go into the export market.I would like to touch on some comments made in this debate by those on the other side, because I constantly try to benchmark the governments performance against the other side. I continue to hear unions being criticised as not caring about the unemployed. Those opposite have also commented that the government does not care about the disadvantaged. Unemployment is constantly blamed on the government, as are the divorce rate—they say that it is a government problem—family breakdown and changing lifestyles.I do not believe that this government is to blame for most of those situations or for a changing Australia. Though it may have contributed to some of those situations, the lifestyles of many people have changed. We will not be going back 20 or 30 years to how people used to live. There are many reasons for that: technological change, workplace change, the greater amount of information that exists in the community today, education and travel. People have a broader range of activities and experiences; they therefore look upon the world in a different way and live a different lifestyle. I sometimes think that those from the other side are moralising along the lines of Queen Victoria. Queen Victoria covered the legs of pianos because it was thought to be in some way wrong not to, yet we know of the total hypocrisy that existed in Victorian England. Another government that seemed to be always holding up morals was the National Party government of Queensland. In a previous debate in this House that government was upheld as being another government that seemed to live quite a hypocritical lie.The government has designed programs to deal with our changing society. Many of those programs are laid down in this budget. They endeavour to assist people who are termed disadvantaged—those who are on low incomes—and try to help the long-term unemployed and tackle the unemployment issue itself. As evidence that I have quoted tonight suggests, our economy is changing direction. I believe some of those problems will be solved. I do not believe those on the other side have any understanding of the changing patterns in the labour market—the restructuring of awards, the productivity increases that have occurred in Australia. Those things have passed them by. I do not believe the opposition has any new ideas—I have not heard of any—on how it would tackle the economy. Opposition members seem to have thrown out the major focus of the policies they had at the last election. Now they are just griping and of course trying to stop this budget in the Senate.I believe the big pictures addressed in the budget are pretty right. We need to get on with the job, and this budget should be passed so that the economy can be stabilised. The many measures in it will continue the governments assistance to the private sector as well. A lot of people have had their say on the budget, and probably more has been said on this budget than on some others. There has been a wide range of comments, and that is good. Hopefully those changes introduced in this budget will be good for the country. It is now time that we got on with the job of passing the budget and put Australia back to work. I support the bill.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1993-94","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
246,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MILES","BI4","(Braddon)","LP","N/A",1026,"—I rise tonight to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1993-94. I was interested in the approach of the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) to the budget. As a former trade union official, I was also interested to note what the ACTU President said about this budget. He asked: how do you defend the indefensible? The honourable member for Lyons did a pretty good job trying to defend the indefensible. That is really what this budget is—indefensible. It cannot be defended by any form of logic.In trying to sum up what the budget really is about—how it will affect Australia and what Australians at this moment think about it—I think we could use these three words: deceit, debt and despair. Since 17 August there has been in Australia a climate of instability and uncertainty. It is now just three weeks since this climate and atmosphere of uncertainty within both the parliament and Australia began. The Australian people have caught this ethos of uncertainty as to where Australia is going. The budget is directionless. There is that feeling and that mood out there amongst the people of Australia—whether in our cities, out on our farms, in small business or in our large business enterprises—that it is directionless. A lot of uncertainty exists out there in the community.It is interesting that in the last week of this three-week period of uncertainty we find the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) accusing a whole range of people for this uncertainty. He says that the uncertainty has been caused by the Senates obstructionism, by the opposition, by the Australian Democrats, by the Greens—or is the uncertainty caused by former state ALP secretaries or by those people who were in the previous Hawke ministry and did not get quite as high up the rung this time? Last of all he said that it has been caused by those people who missed out all together, that they were creating difficulties in the caucus and so forth.In Australia we see emotional frustration. But why have we got this uncertainty? I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to those people listening to this debate that the uncertainty is caused by the deceit and dishonesty during the lead-up to the last election.There would be no uncertainty in Australia today if there had been an honest and open campaign. The uncertainty is caused because the government has no mandate for its proposals in this budget. If it had a mandate and had been open with the Australian people and said, `Look, we are going to put up petrol by 10c a litre; we are going to increase indirect taxes, and the rest of the things it mooted such as the removal of optometry benefits and so on, I have no doubt that we would not be here today in this climate of uncertainty because the opposition would be saying, `This is a legitimate government; it told the people that that is what they would get. It was re-elected and it deserves to have its budget put through.However, the reality is that the uncertainty in Australia today goes back six or eight months and concerns the attitude of the government and particularly the approach of its leader, the Prime Minister, who has dealt dishonestly with the Australian people. Out of that has grown this uncertainty. In the last day or two, that uncertainty has actually led to the devaluation of the dollar, which is an outward expression of many peoples deep uncertainty.In other periods of uncertainty in Australia there has not necessarily been very marked changes in the dollar. But this time the change is dramatic. Having been in the parliament now for a number of years, I decided to go back to the trade weighted index in Australia in 1983. It was 82.4; yesterday it was 47.7. That is a measure of the way in which Labor governments in this country have devalued Australias assets. They have devalued Australia. In the eyes of the world and the international community that is one measure of how Labor administration has been stultifying, has lacked creativity and is bringing Australia to its knees.I reflect on the fact that in 1980-82 we could buy 240 yen for $1. Today we can buy only 67 yen. That is an incredible turnaround in the fortunes of Australia, in our capacity to trade and be competitive. We now find our dollar is not able to buy overseas products to any extent. The Australian dollar is now worth US65c whereas 10 years ago it was worth between $US1.15 and $US1.20. That indicates how Australia has been devalued under Labor administrations in the last decade.Yesterday in the Sydney Morning Herald there was an article about the Prime Ministers leadership. That article underscores why we have uncertainty and instability not only in financial markets but also in smaller business. They are uncertain as to what the future holds for them at this stage. Large businesses feel uncertain about the climate within Australia. The results of a survey in the community have shown that the Prime Minister scores only 3 1/2 out of ten for honesty. The Australian people understand that he went to the election saying, `No new taxes and no higher taxes. In the first budget within six months of the election what do the Australian people get? They get new taxes and higher taxes.Australian people are tired of this duplicity. I have no doubt that if we were elected in the future and turned around on our promises we would cop the same thing from the Australian people. It is very important that we understand that the uncertainty has been caused by the very government that now governs Australia, not by anybody else at all.The second rating in the survey was understanding ordinary peoples needs. In this budget there is a total lack of understanding by the Prime Minister of peoples needs. The caucus had to pull the Prime Minister back to reality and force changes in the budget. The third rating is concern for the underprivileged. Again the Prime Minister rates only 3 1/2 because people perceive him as being aloof, remote, arrogant and uncaring about the plight of ordinary families in Australia. There is no doubt about that. I walk around shopping centres and talk to people in the mills and factories of this country. I have talked to Labor members from time to time and, particularly before the election, I said to them, `Are you inviting the Prime Minister down into your electorate?. They said, `No way, I want to hold my seat if I can. They even recognised the fact that the Prime Minister does not relate to ordinary people. One of their prime concerns as members and backbenchers of the Labor Party is to keep the Prime Minister out of their electorates.The fourth point in this survey was the ability to manage the economy. Again the Prime Minister rates only 3 1/2. In the newspapers today we find that three weeks after the budget was brought down 74 per cent of Australians believe that we need a new budget. What a remarkable figure that is. I do not think I can ever recall such a figure in the 15 or 20 years that I have been interested in politics and have watched the budgets. That is how catastrophic it is perceived in the community. The uncertainty that Australia is now facing comes from this deceitfulness and lack of openness by the government in coming to the election.On 9 February 1993, just before the election was called, we as Australians were told that income tax cuts are law—l-a-w. We now know that under this government it is a very flexible law. `Law has taken on a totally new meaning. It is very interesting to look at what the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said today. He said:We now have a budget that will create a stable basis on which investment can occur.What a lot of hogwash. That is another dishonest statement by a very senior member of this government. Absolutely nobody in the community believes that, yet the Treasurer continues to peddle that line. On 19 November 1992, the Prime Minister said:What I am promising is not to put up taxes.But what do we see in this budget? We see wholesale sales tax, petrol tax and so on going up.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1993-94","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is absolutely incredible to think that a country so rich and wealthy, so well developed and highly educated, could run up such a debt in so short a time.

On 24 January 1990—I ask honourable members to remember this—the Prime Minister said:In three years time there will be no government debt, domestic or external. Its an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the Government of Australia.It was actually an outrageous claim. Three years later, we have the highest debt we have ever seen. Overseas debt, our trading debt and our budget deficit are at record highs. It is disgraceful. As I said before, we are enormously rich in resources yet we cannot trade adequately and profitably under this government. In this 1993 budget the government wishes to raise an extra $21.9 billion. Government debt is up $85 billion—that has nothing to do with private enterprise debt—yet the Prime Minister said three years ago that there would be no government debt, internal or external.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1993-94","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

I want to go back to a selection of his comments on previous budgets. In 1987 he said:This is the great coming of age of Australia. This is the golden age of economic change.In 1988 he said:This is the one which brings home the bacon.In 1989 he said:Tonight I can report that we are much further down the road of that fundamental restructuring.What sort of restructuring has it been? There has been none. Things have got worse and Australia is sagging at the knees. In 1990 the Prime Minister said:Economic policy has worked and is working . . . this year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up.What a lot of nonsense. I wonder whether the Prime Minister has ever told the truth about budgets? Lastly, in 1992 the Prime Minister said:This Budget is a budget of action on jobs.Has this parliament noticed the change in unemployment?","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1993-94","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

254,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MILES","BI4","(Braddon)","LP","N/A",1026,"—Exactly. Not only are there still over one million unemployed people but we also have 500,000 people on training schemes for jobs that do not exist—and we probably have half a million people already trained in those areas.The other point I want to mention is despair. Deceit, debt and despair are how this budget can be summarised. When we talk to ordinary Australians, the breadwinners in the homes, they are despairing, agonised and concerned about their families and themselves. They do not know how they will buy new cars if their cars are 10 years old. How will they cope? In looking at the criteria in the budget, it is predicted that inflation will rise, unemployment will rise, the budget deficit will be up, overseas debt will be up, interest rates most probably will rise and, on top of that, we have taxation increases.It would be different if taxation went up but the deficit started going down. We would understand that. There would be light at the end of the tunnel. We would say, `We have spent our money ahead of time. We have to repay it. Taxes will have to go up and we will have to handle it. At least we could say that the debt was going down and programs were going into place. At the end of the day we would see some progress.But this budget is one of utter despair because economically there is no light at the end of the tunnel. The big issues are not being addressed by this government. Unemployed people see no hope at all. There has been no change in unemployment for the last two or three years. There are no downward trends emerging; if anything, it has become so entrenched that many of us wonder how we will get out of the mess, out of the hole the government has dug for this country over the last decade.But there is a better way of running this country. The first thing is to be honest and open about the countrys problems instead of continually telling people one thing and going in another direction, as this government does continually. Coming up to the election it said `Everything is fine, the economy is starting to grow. We do not need any extra taxes or to raise taxation and we do not need any more indirect taxation. But it did exactly the opposite.We need honesty and a straightforward approach to addressing Australias problems. We also need a sense of balance. We will have to address our overseas debt and get our budget back into balance. If we do that, we can restore hope to Australia and say, `There is a bright future for this country and for our young people. Therefore, this budget being one of deceit, debt and despair, I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge).Debate (on motion by Mr Tickner ) adjourned.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1993-94","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

257,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HICKS","AH4","(Riverina)","NP","N/A",1029,"—On the day after the budget announcement I had a telephone call from a trucking operator who was most upset. He said that as a result of the budget—he had not had much chance to study it—he thought he would have to put off two of his five drivers because there was no way he could pay the extra $1,200 a month fuel charge.The sad thing was that of those workers, one was 45 years old and one was 48 years old. He asked me about what type of training schemes he could speak to them about and what chance these men had of finding a job in the future. I felt very sad for him and said, `We have a real problem with the long-term unemployed in this country. I really do not have the answers.Time has passed by. I telephoned him again today because I wanted to find out what had happened. We had hoped that the Australian Democrats or the Greens would have blocked the legislation and joined the coalition in trying to save jobs and costs on the business sector so that more people could be employed. He said, `Its still in the pipeline. I just hope that the Democrats come good and block these rises in the Senate so that we can keep these men on. Otherwise, they will have to go. I made further phone calls because there are a lot of trucking operators in the Riverina. I found out from speaking to these people that, on average, small transport fleets working out of New South Wales have about six semitrailers.The excise on about 600,000 litres of fuel in the first year would amount to $18,000 and the tax on tyres per year would amount to $5,000. This is, of course, the new consumption tax. The on-costs of a new prime mover per year would be $2,000. All the other on-costs are about $10,000. At a conservative estimate, these new tax imposts will cost the average trucking operator about $35,000. That is one mans wages for the year. As honourable members can see from that, there will be no new people employed. A consumption tax will add to the cost of everything. The government is cutting expenditure on roads by $608 million.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Those people who travel consistently, as most members do in their electorates, particularly the larger electorates, know the state of the road system today. The government recently announced that the Newell Highway and the Sturt Highway were going to become part of the national highway system. Looking at these cuts in funding, I would say that we will be back to goat tracks in no time.There is also the problem of the owner-driver who is trying to make ends meet. He cannot squeeze between a rock and a hard place. He may subcontract to large trucking operators. They cannot pay him extra money. The people he is carting for cannot afford the extra costs, so where does he go? He tries to become even more competitive. He just cannot do it. Of course, in this bid to try to stay in operation and pay for his rig, he finds that he has to do things that he would not normally do.Along with the bad roads and the pressure put on these trucking operators, this is just unbelievable. I think this will lead to a national tragedy. I urge the government, for safety sake, to please think again about these extra costs it has put on to business, not only on the trucking operators—heaven knows they will find it extremely difficult—but on the whole population.Honourable members may have heard that the Letona cannery has gone into receivership. The transport costs in the Letona cannery alone amount to many thousands of dollars a year. That is just one example of a business that is trying to survive and having these extra costs put upon it. I ask the government and the Democrats to please rethink their situation because they are doing tremendous damage to the Australian economy.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
260,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HOLLIS","DH4","(Throsby)","ALP","N/A",1030,"—Much has been made recently about the conditions of many of the ships that are coming around the Australian coast, commonly referred to as rust buckets. Perhaps not enough is made about some of the working conditions on these ships and some of the conditions that the seafarers have to put up with. The report Ships of shame referred to denial of food, bashing, sexual molestation, deprivation of medical care, as well as underpayment or non-payment of wages.Recently there was a case in Queensland of a Greek ship that had 11 Burmese seamen on it. These seamen had been working up to 90 hours a week. Many of them had been at sea for up to nine months and were being paid the princely sum of between 50c and $1 an hour. There was back pay owing to these people of something like $143,000. When the union movement got involved in this matter and the Burmese sea people were repatriated, they were intercepted at Singapore by the Burmese authorities and taken off the plane; in fact, they were held at Singapore airport for four days. They were repatriated or taken forcibly back to Burma, and they have disappeared since then.It is well known that the Burmese government, which is in reality a military dictatorship, has an appalling record of actions and attitudes against human life and dignity and the brutal oppression of its nationals. It is doubtful today whether there are any Burmese beneficial owned ships left. Phoney foreign shipping companies and phoney unions take advantage of the situation to savagely exploit Burmese seafarers. Amongst the worst offenders are the Germans, the Japanese, the Maltese and the Greeks.Mr Speaker, you do not have to take my word for the condition of many of these ships. We both represent the Illawarra area, which includes the port of Kembla. Like me, you have been approached many times and have visited those ships. But honourable members do not have to take our word for it. I suggest to honourable members that, if they doubt the conditions that many of these seafarers have to exist under, they should go and talk to some of the chaplains and to people in organisations such as Missions to the Seamen or Stella Maris. The chaplains will tell them of the appalling conditions under which many of these seafarers have to exist.What worries me very much is that there is a movement around to abolish cabotage. This is where we have Australian flag ships around the Australian coastline. Unfortunately, many opposite who argue for the abolition of cabotage would want to see these `ships of shame, as the report so rightly called them, around the Australian coastline. They would want to see seafarers from Third World countries being paid 50c or $1 an hour. They would want to see them being abused and deprived of food and medical care. That is what they are asking for when they talk about opening up the Australian coastline to these foreign flag vessels. We must never open up the Australian coastline to these foreign flag vessels.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Messrs Keating and Co can add to your debt at any time, raise interest on late payments, etcetera.As I observed in my reply, the timing was ironic. The day I received his letter, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had done just that. Since budget day we have heard a lot about broken promises and tax increases. The changes to HECS announced in the budget could fit into either category. Under the new arrangements, students will commence repayments earlier and at higher rates. The government will take more money from their pockets.HECS, the higher education contribution scheme, is one of those typical euphemisms beloved by our Public Service. It has another name—the graduate tax. The changes to the scheme are just another tax increase. They should be resisted, along with all the other unfair tax measures contained in this years bungled budget.I am probably one of the few people in this House who have paid the graduate tax. Those of us who have experienced the scheme can quite understand why my constituents should be scared. Each year tertiary students sign a payment options form. They are given the choice of paying the fees for that years tuition up-front or having them deducted from their earnings once they reach a certain level. The students who take the latter option are signing a one-sided agreement. They are signing a contract with a party that can change conditions at whim. But they have no option: they can do a deal with an untrustworthy government, or they can forget about their education.Some honourable members opposite believe that we have no right to question the equity of the governments budget. They say we would have offered something much worse, but that is no defence. Voters had two clear choices on election day. They rejected the Liberal Partys proposals. Now the government has choices of its own to make. It can say that it was elected by default or admit that it promised a program that it knew could not be delivered or, worse, that it had no intention of delivering.The Liberal Partys tertiary education and student assistance policies at the last election were significant vote losers. Despite the fact that our calculations showed that Austudy rises would more than compensate for tax and other changes, students considered that they could be worse off. We are only just beginning to consider opinions for a new policy, but I am convinced that it will have to be significantly different. We must have clearly stated positions on issues such as fees, the range of courses offered and course numbers.We must remove the perception that the reforms we offer are motivated by ideology rather than a desire to provide quality further education to the maximum number of students. In the meantime, however, the new HECS charges, like so many of the budget tax changes, should be opposed. Throughout the election campaign we heard much from the ALP about how higher education would be restricted to the wealthy under a Liberal government. Now the ALP has unveiled an unexpected burden that will mainly hit young people trying to establish a new career.At the next election, students themselves should show greater maturity and weigh our proposals against Labors education record, rather than listening to the simplistic guff offered by so many student leaders. The National Union of Students campaigned hysterically against the coalition. The government has shown just how seriously it takes the NUS, and how grateful it was for its support. NUS has failed the people it claims to represent. It has failed miserably. In 1993, full fee courses are a reality for some students. A political lobbyist who delivered those results would be sacked quick smart. Students should start thinking about the service they receive from NUS.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I, too, like one of the previous speakers, had a phone call from a truck operator on the day after the budget. His major concern was that the cost of leasing his vehicle had actually decreased quite considerably over the past 12 months. He said, `You are going to be hit with flak about the cost of fuel prices, but I can assure you that I can lease my truck, which is worth $180,000, for some $1,200 a month less now than I could 12 months ago.Claims have been made that everyone will be affected; the price of every consumable will rise; the price of petrol has risen and so this cost will have to be passed on. We should not forget that here in Australia we have one of the lowest world prices for liquefied petroleum products. The tax component in the price we pay is lower than that of almost every other industrialised nation.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[4]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

If we consider the average interstate vehicle—six axles and worth about $180,000—the costs include registration, insurance, tyres, maintenance and repayments. The increased costs of fuel excise will add about 2.3 per cent to the cost of running this vehicle. Do not get me wrong, Mr Speaker; I do not wish to justify increases at all. In June 1990 the interest rate on truck purchases was 19.25 per cent, and today it is 10 per cent.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[4]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Over the past two years the cost of transport has decreased. I am not aware of these costs having been passed on. I am not aware of any accolades from the other side to indicate that transport in this country should be getting cheaper.But there is more, Mr Speaker. Over recent years the payload of trucks has also increased. The average payload now for a semi is about 30 tonnes—an increase of about 15 per cent. If the owner spreads to a B-double, then the cost efficiency is even greater.I also represent a rural electorate. I am aware of the importance of trucks. Today, in the New South Wales budget, the Premier reduced the expenditure on roads by $50 million. Roads are so necessary in our state. We all know what the Premier of New South Wales did to the rail services over the previous six years. The trucking industry is important. I would urge members of the trucking industry to look at the full spectrum of costs that have been passed on to the trucking industry by the policies of this government, and I am sure that they need not run headlong into getting rid of some of their employees, as members of the opposition would suggest. Instead, I urge them to look at it in a logical manner, and if they add up all their costs they will find out that they are not only delivering a bigger payload today, but also doing it cheaper.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[4]/speech/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
270,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr NEVILLE","KV5","(Hinkler)","NP","N/A",1032,"—I rise tonight to draw the attention of the House to the effects of the budget on an important part of my electorate—Central Queensland. The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) just gave us a little diatribe on behalf of the government. If he thinks that his were good illustrations of the point, let me give him a couple of bobby-dazzlers to show him the impact of the excise on some parts of this nation.I draw the attention of the House to the city of Gladstone—often called the engine room of Queensland. In Gladstone, between them Queensland Alumina Ltd and Boyne Smelters employ 2,100 employees and several hundred contractors. QAL is the largest alumina refinery in the world with a production of 3.3 million tonnes. Honourable members who follow the light metals market will know that the price of aluminium is at a historic low.Despite this impediment, the bauxite to alumina process and the alumina to aluminium process are amongst the best examples of value adding in Australia. Both represent a value adding factor of 10 or more. One could confidently say that QAL is a classic example of a good export oriented industry going places. It is an Australian leader in the field. It has good work practices, a superior work force, creative management, is a good corporate citizen, and is a leader in training and innovation.In these heady days dedicated to micro-economic reform, how does the government respond? As a result of measures in the current budget QAL will be set with an additional bill of $8.2 million a year. This will take place by the time the fuel excise reaches 5c a litre in August 1994. While I do not suggest that QAL will necessarily look at it in this light, $8.2 million a year represents 275 jobs. It is a graphic illustration of the gravity of the situation in a tightening and uncertain economic climate.As if the problems induced by the uncertainty of Mabo and Wik were not enough, and as if the fact that a $1.75 billion project involving a powerhouse and a third potline at the Boyne smelter were not enough, now we have this marvellous engine-room city subjected to a fuel bill of $8.2 million a year by way of excise and other tax hikes.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[5]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The Moura-Gladstone line is not electrified. This line—wait for it—uses 5.5 million litres of diesel fuel per year. That means that by the time the excise reaches 5c a litre next August the cost of operating this line will increase by $275,000 through that measure alone, and it will make the total excise bill on that one train line $1.6 million a year. Finally, the country railway line from Maryborough to Monto and into Gladstone uses 1.7 million litres of diesel a year. Again at 5c a litre, that represents $85,000 a year or a total excise bill per year of $500,000. This is one of the lines that Mr Goss had marked for closure.In this short address I have illustrated, firstly, how it affects the country situation; secondly, how it affects the infrastructure of a port city; and, thirdly, how it affects a very important industry at the coalface of exporting. The Government should do more than speak about micro-economic reform. When it frames its budget it should practice what it preaches.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[5]/speech/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
275,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mrs EASSON","RU5","(Lowe)","ALP","N/A",1033,"—I rise to inform the House of the very dangerous situation which now exists between the government of the Peoples Republic of China and Mr Han Dong Fang. Mr Han is the leader of the autonomous free trade unions in China. Three weeks ago he attempted to return to China from Hong Kong. He was illegally expelled from China, his homeland, and is still endeavouring to return. This illegal act also involved the arbitrary cancellation of Mr Hans valid passport on 16 August.Mr Han is not a particularly well man. He has been treated in Hong Kong and the United States of America for tuberculosis which, unfortunately, he contracted whilst in a labour camp in China. The crime of this gentleman is to want his great country to live in the modern world. He wants the rule of law and he wants free trade unions. He wants the ordinary civil rights associated with democracy. Nobody in this House would take any exception to these aspirations, yet today in China such aspirations will endanger ones life.China is a great nation. The history and the achievements of the Chinese people are immense and truly magnificent, yet today ancient and out of touch attitudes prevail. The leadership of China, unelected and without any legitimacy based on democratic norms, seems to think that it can produce a 21st century economy to stand on the shoulders of a society organised on Manchu imperial principles. These leaders, being communists, do not know much about human nature or the real dynamics of history. They cling to a failed, stupid, washed-out marxism that maintains that people are just resources to be used and manipulated at will. The true history of the 20th century is the story of mankind rebelling against such state terrorism. Mr Han Dong Fang is such a rebel, and he deserves our care and our support.I congratulate the government for its prompt and principled approach to the Chinese government on this mans position. The Australian government has expressed its deep concern at the expulsion of Mr Han. The government has also reiterated the importance that Australia attaches to the universal recognition of basic human rights. These human rights include trade union rights and the right of residency in ones own country.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[6]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Australias future is very much tied up with our Asian neighbours. We must learn from them. I respectfully suggest that our neighbours may usefully learn one or two things from us. The rule of law is the first of my modest suggestions. This House is a model for the rule of law. Government leaders in our neighbourhood can learn from this House. We may be occasionally unruly, but we are never illegal.The fate of Mr Han Dong Fang at the hands of the armed men who rule China is a symptom of the real problems that face China.

278,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MACK","AT4","(North Sydney)","IND","N/A",1034,"—The Commonwealth has demonstrated great concern at the war crimes which occurred more than 50 years ago in other countries halfway around the world. On behalf of the victims of those crimes, and in the interests of justice, the Commonwealth has spent so far more than $20 million with patently little chance of success. Yet the Commonwealth cannot find enough funds, enough compassion or enough interest in justice to try to get to the bottom of a major and comparatively recent crime which killed or mutilated a number of innocent Australians standing in George Street, Sydney.I refer, of course, to the Hilton bombing which is without doubt the worst act of political terrorism in Australian history—a crime which killed William Favell, Alec Carter and Constable Paul Burmistriw and inflicted terrible, disabling injuries on Constable Terry Griffiths and Colin Nicholls. I was saddened and more than a little disappointed to learn that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) recently wrote to Mr Griffiths rejecting his plea for a joint Commonwealth-state royal commission of inquiry into the Hilton tragedy.In a two-page letter, which amounts to nothing more than a classic exercise in buck-passing, the Attorney-General told Mr Griffiths that if an inquiry is needed it is up to the New South Wales government to set one up, knowing that such an inquiry would be pointless. In his letter to Terry Griffiths the Attorney-General seemed to imply that 15 years is an inordinately long time for people to be still going on about this multiple murder and mutilation of innocent people. He flicked off any suggestions that there are outstanding questions that the Commonwealth has to answer and told Mr Griffiths that it was essentially a state matter.As the Attorney-General would know, he has put Terry Griffiths in a classic catch-22 situation by referring him back to New South Wales, because the state government has already said that it will not proceed other than by way of a joint inquiry with the Commonwealth. This is for the very good reason that if New South Wales goes it alone it will not be able to penetrate the cloak of immunity and secrecy surrounding the Commonwealth security forces.Terry Griffiths has raised serious and substantial questions about the part played by Commonwealth agencies and officers in the Hilton affair, and they cannot be brushed aside. Commonwealth agencies were directly involved in providing security at the Hilton. They included the then Commonwealth Police, ASIO and the Australian Defence Force.The fact that the Hilton bombing was allowed to happen at all amounts to an awesome failure of security. Nobody could defend such breathtaking incompetence, negligence or stupidity on the part of the security forces as would permit the placing of a bomb in a garbage bin at the entrance to the Hilton Hotel, a place where visiting heads of government were passing frequently and which should have been secured for the duration of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. For such a thing to have happened, one can conclude only that the agencies responsible were run by fools or, alternatively, that there is a more sinister explanation. Whichever it is, it must be answered.The bombing was allowed to happen by Commonwealth and state agencies specifically charged with the prevention of just such an event, yet no-one in the security forces, federal or state, has ever been called to account publicly for this gross failure of responsibility. The only conclusion one can draw from this is the one that Terry Griffiths has arrived at—that Commonwealth officers and agencies responsible are involved in a cover-up; they are protecting their own; they are not interested in justice but in their own survival.The Hilton bombing was an outrage against citizens of this country. Australia speaks out relentlessly on human rights abuses all over the world—in Cambodia, Somalia, South Africa, Kuwait, Yugoslavia and China. We have had plenty to say about all these situations and places, and sometimes at great expense we send troops to ensure that justice is done, but back home the same sense of honour and responsibility and concern for justice is denied. It is a great disappointment that the Attorney-General has not been able to take a fresh look at this issue and, instead, has chosen to adopt the tired and unconvincing advice—which we have already heard from his predecessors—coming up to him from the bureaucracy.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[7]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Throughout Australia there are 2 1/2 million members of credit unions. In my electorate the Hastings Credit Union has 17,200 members, the Macleay Mutual Credit Union has 14,300 members and the Bananacoast Community Credit Union has 27,000 members.The removal of the tax exemption will hit credit unions with an additional cost of $50 million which they cannot afford because credit unions are run by voluntary directors and are really non-profit organisations. At the same time the government is extending subsidies of about $120 million to foreign banks to enable them to try to seek small business.The decision of the Treasurer ignores the unique role in the retail finance sector of community credit unions. They are owned and funded completely by their members and any income earned by the credit union, apart from that required to meet expenses and prudent reserves, is returned to the members in the form of better rates of interest on savings and loans. These are savings and loans for houses, cars, small business and for all sorts of family reasons.A tax on credit unions is a tax on choice. Whilst the government is handing out tax breaks and subsidies worth hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign and domestic banks, we are seeing community based organisations and community based credit being hit to leg with a unfair, unjust tax.
