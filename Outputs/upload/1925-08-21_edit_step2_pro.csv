As a consequence, I received the following reply from Mr. Love, secretary to the Board of Directors: -Replying to your telegram of to-day, under section 15a of the Commonwealth Bank Act, members of the Board are prohibited from disclosing the business of the bank or its customers. Mr. Garvan informs us he is furnishing you with a statement. For your information, advances were made by all banks to enable subscriptions to be made to early war loans at one-half of 1 per cent. less than the rate the loan was floated at. For instance, all banks were advancing to the general public at 4 per cent. to enable subscriptions to be made to the 4½ per cent. loan, and these overdrafts were arranged for eighteen months, or, in special cases, longer. The general overdraft rate for the Commonwealth Bank was never more than6 per cent. during the period of the Mutual Life and Citizens subscriptions to the loans.Subsequently, I received the following telegram from Mr. John J. Garvan, who is Chairman of Directors of the Commonwealth Bant, and managing director of the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company Limited: -Referring to your telegram to the Bank on the subject of Colemans question, as managing director of the Mutual Life and Citizens, I desire to make the following statement : - In 1915, nine years prior to my becoming a Director of the Bank, the Mutual Life and Citizens made an arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank to overdraw its account to enable it to subscribe to war loans. This arrangement was common to all banks, and all loan subscribers, except that in the case of the Mutual Life and Citizens the amount subscribed has been £12,000,000 sterling, and that it has involved the appropriation of all the companys accumulations for a period of nearly ten years, during which the company was perforce compelled to abstain from carrying on its ordinary business of leading money. When I joined the board last year, the overdraft was £350,000. This amount has since been paid off, and the Bank is indebted to the company in the sum of £50,000. On the 1 1th inst., the Bank was informed that no further accommodation would be required, and that the account would be closed.","COMMONWEALTH BANK","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

36,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","Martin","NAT","Minister for Trade and Customs",1648,". - I move -That the bill be now read a second time.This measure contains definitions of the terms of our preference, and asks Parliament to prescribe for preferential tariff purposes the conditions of manufacture which will constitute goods the produce or manufacture of a country. Section 8 of the Customs Tariff Act reads -The rates of duty set out in the schedule in the column headed British preferential tariff  shall applyto goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, subject to the condition that the goods have been shipped in the United Kingdom to Australia, and have not been transhipped, or, if transhipped, then only if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Collector that the intended destination of the goods, when originally shipped from the United Kingdom, was Australia.It will be observed that the main condition of this section, which governs the concessions given to the United Kingdom in our tariff, is that the goods must be the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom. A similar provision has been included in our tariff legislation since 1907,when British preference was first instituted. As the term goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom  is capable of different interpretations, it is necessary to have a specific definition in order that the mercantile community may understand exactly the conditions of preference. At the inception of the policy of preference this definition was made by a decision of the Minister of the day, who ruled that goods containing 25 per cent. of labour and materials of United Kingdom origin were entitled to preference. These conditions were embodied in later administrations. Honorable members may ask why this bill is being introduced. I remind them that in the earlier stages of this policy the concession was comparatively small, but Parliament, being sympathetic with British trade, increased the preference in later tariffs. The tariff of 1921 gave more substantial advantages to goods from the Motherland. To-day, this preference to British goods represents about £8,000,000 a year. In 1907, when the preference was small, the proportion of British labour and material in goods did not matter so much; but to-day the concession, as I have shown, represents a substantial advantage. It is common knowledge that in recent years the British manufacturing industry has been faced with the keenest opposition from continental countries, with the result that there is a steady increase in the importation of foreign manufactures into the United Kingdom. Honorable members will recollect that there has been a considerable amount of dissatisfaction in recent years at the increasing continental incidence of British preference terms. Nodoubt, they will also recall my statement in the House last September, that the Government had decided to make some re-arangement in the terms of British preference. This bill is the outcome. Its purpose is to give power to lay down the conditions of preference. When the (preference was small, and when the conditions in England were not as they are to-day, the legality of ministerial interpretation was not questioned, but now that the conditionsare more stringent, some doubt as cast upon the legal position. This objection actually affects everything that has been done since 1907. It concerns the 25 per cent. justas muchas it affects the 7.5 percent. policy.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is no need For moto dwell on the necessity for a definition. The Government submits a well-considered definition of the terms of British preference - terms that are heartily acclaimed by all good British manufacturers, and will not hurt them in any way if they desire to be bona fide. An almost ludicrous state of affairs has arisen. Textile goods manufactured entirely on the Continent of Europe have been sent to England, and there dyed, measured, and wrapped, and have then come to this country under the terms of British preference. Machines in parts have been made on the Continent, and assembled and packed in England, and have come here under the terms of British preference. I am sorry to say that there is in England a type of AngloContinental manufacturer, and he should be prevented from doing this sort of thing. The irontrade imports into Great Britain from the Continent have increased recently to an enormous extent.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

44,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","N/A","N/A","N/A",1649,"- I agree with the honorable member. Importations of billets, sheet-iron, bars, and bars in sections have increased, since 1922, from 316,000 tons to 1,337,000 tons in 1924. This is not a question affecting party policy. But for the action taken by the Government on the 1st April last, I am quite sure that a considerable quantity of that tonnage would have come to Australia as camouflaged British goods. One or two other illustrations of the incidence of British preference may be interesting to the House. French hair brushes were slightly finished in Great Britain, and when they were packed in British cases came into Australia as British goods. Babies feeding bottles, if they were fitted in Great Britain with rubber teats and tubes, although the glass was manufactured on the Continent, were classed as of British manufacture. Cheese, or fruit jars madein Germany were sent to England, and, after a rubber fitting and clip had been added, came to Australia as British. A very high legal opinion is that any articles made in Great Britain, whatever the source of the materials, or the proportion of foreign materials, are entitled to come here under the British preferential terms. I submit that that was not what the House intended when it gave that generous measure of preference to our kinsmen in the Home Land. This is a matter for honorable members to decide on the facts at their disposal, and their knowledge of what has taken place. This short bill will not injure true British trade. We recognize that Great Britain is a manufacturing country and an importer of raw materials, and we give the full preferential terms to British goods made from raw materials imported from any part of the world, so long as all possible processes of manufacture are performed in Great Britain.

There is also a provision in the regulations that partial manufacture in Australia shall be regarded as British manufacture. If, for instance, we export wooltops to Great Britain, and they are there made into cloth, the Australian labour in the article is regarded as British labour. That provision, I hope, will do a little to promote industry in Australia. There is a further provision by which we do not disturb the old conditions of the 25 per cent, preference so long as they do not interfere with Australian industry. Power is also given to the Minister to vary the regulations to help either British or Australian industries.For instance, the British motor car industry is, by virtue of our not making motor chassis in Australia, under the 25 per cent. provisions, but an application has been made by the motor car manufacturers of Great Britain to put them under the 75 per cent. provisions. I believe the House will give any Minister power to do that in the interests of British trade. I confidently submit this bill, which is long overdue, to the House. I am not prepared to say that all our regulations under the British preferential tariff have been ultra vires since 1907, but the Crown Law authorities say that there is some doubt about the matter.

It was introduced last session; and has been on the business-paper once or twice since the year 1918. Section 40 of the Distillation Act 1901 states-No entry authorizing the removal of spirits shall be passed in respect of spirits of a lower strength than 25 per centum underproof, nor in respect of a smaller quantity than 10 gallons.Section 76 (1) which states -  No person shall sell spirits of a less strength than 25 degrees under proof  , was repealed by an amendment of the act in 1918, and section 40 should have been amended at the same time to conform with the action which Parliament then took. The object of the Distillation Act as originally enacted was to fix a standard of strength for the consumer. At that time, some of the states had no legislation whatever on this matter. Now all the states have legislation affecting the percentage of spirits . for public consumption, and the standard of strength fixed is, in some cases, lower than that fixed in the original Commonwealth Act. . It is common knowledge that the states control their own pure food legislation, under which the standard of spirits for consumption is fixed. It is obvious that the Commonwealth Government irrespective of any act that it may pass, cannot interfere with that legislation.","Second Reading","DISTILLATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Minister has admitted that Mr. de Bavays ability as a chemist is unquestioned.I think he is the only man in Australia who has successfully manufactured power alcohol.

I want it clearly understood that I am not opposed to the small experiments that will be made at the Plane Creek mill. My objection to this measure is that it does not go far enough, and is merely tinkering with a big national question. In view of the big federal surplus announced by the Treasurer, this bill treats in a niggardly way a question of such national importance as the provision of power alcohol for Australia. Instead of granting £5,000 per annum for five years,the Government would be justified in spending £300,000 in an endeavour to establish the power alcohol industry.

For that reason I desire that a full inquiry should be made. This matter was first brought forward in Queensland in 1915, when Mr. G. P. Barber, M.L.A., who representsBundaberg in the Queensland Parliament, waited on Mr. Theodore, the then Treasurer of Queensland, and urged that an inquiry should be made into the possibility of manufacturing power alcohol in that state. Had the war not intervened, the Queensland Government would have taken this matter up. I do not propose to go into the details of his scheme, but Mr. Barber was one of those who initiated the movement in Queensland. The bounty proposed under this bill is not to be paid until the 1st of January, 1926. Clause 4 reads-Bounty under this act shall be payable in respect of power alcohol manufactured in Australia and delivered from the control of the Customs during the period commencingon the 1st day of January, 1926, and ending on the 31st day of December, 1931.Four months have still to elapse before the bill, if passed, will become operative, and I submit that in that period the whole matter could be thoroughly investigated by the select committee; it should not take more than five or six weeks. The experts in Queensland could be brought to Melbourne, or the committee could visit North Queensland. These men have studied the question for years, more particularly since there has been an over-production of sugar in Queensland. They believe that the production of power alcohol from molasses would solve the problem of the over-production of sugar. Mr. Seymour Howe, Mr. de Bavay, and others estimate that the price of 42s. 7d. per ton could be paid for the 40 per cent. surplus production of cane for the manufacture of power alcohol, as against6s. 2d. per ton for cane for the manufacture of surplus sugar for export at proclamation price of £9 10s. per ton.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[2]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, a telegram from Mr. W. C. Griffen, the president of the Northern United Canegrowers Association, says -Cairns Cane-growers Association urges upon Government to postpone further reading of Power Alcohol Bill until copy of bill has been received and considered toy those interested in the North.At a large and representative meeting, held at Innisfail, at North Queensland, and reported in the Cairns Post, the following resolutions were passed: -That Messrs. A. J. Draper. E. Hunter, and W. F. Seymour-Howe, be a committee to take the necessary steps to further the appointment of a commission of inquiry into the production of power alcohol from sugar-cane and molasses.That this meeting, representative of the cane-growers from Cairns to Ingham, empowers the foregoing committee to make the fullest inquiries for the purpose, of facilitating the investigations of the commission of experts, for which application lias already been made to thu authorities.I mention that to show that the sugar interests of Queensland are not satisfied with the bill, and desire a further inquiry with a view to liberalizing the bill. For that reason, it should be referred to a select committee. On the 8th inst., I received a telegram from Mr. Seymour Howe stating- that he had sent a wire to the Minister for Trade and Customs asking that proceedings on the bill be delayed until consideration could- be given to a letter, enclosing an interesting report, which he was forwarding to the Minister. I have further correspondence on the subject before me, but it is difficult at a glance to select from it the references to an inquiry into this matter by a select committee. I shall have an opportunity of speaking later on the subject, when I shall put this evidence on record. As I am not permitted to discuss the merits or demerits of the bill on the question now before the House, all I can do is to urge upon the Minister the vital importance of the matter to Australia, and particularly to Queensland.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[2]/continue[26]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

110,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","N/A","N/A","N/A",1655,"- Yes, Mr. Theodore recognizes its importance. Although the Queensland Government came forward with a guarantee of a loan of £25,000 in connexion with this proposition, I am satisfied that it would welcome a further inquiry into the matter. I. am not opposed to the bill, but desire that its scope should be extended, and that a big national question should be dealt with much more generously. I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of having the matter more fully investigated. I asked the honorable gentleman some questions on this subject yesterday, and in his reply he admitted that the inquiries which have been made were made in Sydney, and that those who investigated the matter did not visit Queensland in connexion with their inquiry. The Minister further said that no member of the TariffBoard is a chemist, but one of them was a director of munitions during the war. When I asked whether Mr. Seymour Howe, manager of the Mulgrave Sugar Mill, or Mr. de Bavay. was asked to give any evidence to the Tariff Board, the reply I received was that these gentlemen had not offered to give evidence. I assume that if the committee suggested by the honorable member for Perth were taking evidence on this subject it would take steps to get it from those who are in a position to give valuable information, and would, if necessary, visit North Queensland to secure firsthand information about it. An inquiry by a committee would probably result in the people of Australia getting cheaper sugar, because it would be found that the surplus production of sugar could be used in the manufacture of power alcohol.  I submit to the Minister that, on his own admission, a fuller inquiry should be made into this question.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[2]/continue[27]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When the measure first came under my notice Z thought it was one which honorable members would be prepared to pass without delay. It seemed to me quite a harmless measure, because under it the Government does not propose to pay any bounty until the article is produced. Those who take any interest in the matter must be aware that the question is one which should be dealt with at once, and should not be indefinitely postponed. Honorable members should ask themselves what position we are likely to be in when we get a report from the proposed committee, if it is appointed. If they will examine the constitution of the committee proposed, they will see that such a committee would probably present majority and minority reports, because there could be no agreement between its members. Some of the members selected by the honorable member for Perth for appointment to the committee desire that it should be appointed in order that they may have an opportunity of bringing in a report turning down the bill, whilst the honorable member who has just resumed his seat desires that a report may be submitted advising that it should not be turned down, but that its provisions should be considerably extended.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The reference of a bill to a committee is only one way of postponing its consideration indefinitely. It is true that the honorable member for Perth has suggested a limited period of six weeks within which the proposed committee should report to the House, but I think it is very likely that the House would be appealed to by the committee 1 i extend the time for the presentation of its report, and I fear that if the matter is not dealt with now, it will not be dealt with in this Parliament.  I think we should go right on with the consideration of the bill. If it is found necessary, amendments may be moved in committee to extend its scope, and I have myself given notice of an. amendment which has been circulated.

This question is of very great importance to Queensland An important firm has offered to establish this industry, and we should not turn such an offer down. This firm would be given no monopoly under the bill. The bill merely gives it the right to carry on the industry and prove its .success. If this firm cannot make a success of the industry, others can try to do -so ; as there is nothing to prevent other persons taking up the industry. The reference of the bill to a select committee might result in delaying the establishment of the industry. It has been stated by the honorable member for Perth that the measure may lead to the taking up of a great deal of land for the growth of crops suitable for the production of power alcohol which may be required for the production of food for starving people in other countries of the world. But there are 100,000,000 acres of land in Queensland at present unoccupied, and there is a great deal of land there suitable for the production of cassava. It has been grown in that state successfully, but it was of no use to proceed with its cultivation while there was no market for it. The International. Sugar Alcohol Company has sent out to Australia its most expert man, and it is prepared to spend £50,000 of its own money to establish these works. Why then, should we check it? This is a young country, and we ought to encourage everything that will make for progress and development.

I was amazed, on reading it, to find that evidence was taken from only two witnesses; one was Mr. Board, the representative of the International Sugar Alcohol Company Limited, of London, the company which will receive the bounty, and the other was Mr. Herbert Powell, a director of Power Alcohol, Sydney.

The amount of bounty to be paid under this bill will be comparatively small, but it will grow. I am not at all enamoured of the proposal to appoint a select committee, but I feel strongly that the evidence taken by the Public Accounts Committee should be available to us before we are asked to vote on the bill.

The investigations of a select committee would be an unnecessary duplication of the inquiry recently undertaken by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. This whole matter was very painstakingly investigated by that committee for several months. The honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) has stated that a select committee could submit a report in five or six weeks. If it has taken the Joint Committee of Public Accounts months to make its investigation, I fail to see how a select committee could adequately deal with it in a few weeks. The Public Accounts Committee has taken very valuable evidence on the production of power alcohol from molasses and prickly pear, and its report will be most useful to honorable members; but in view of the statement by the Minister that the passing of this bill will not prevent encouragement being given to those who are endeavouring to produce power alcohol from other sources than those stated in it, I cannot see that there is anything to be gained by delaying its passage.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If that report indicates that it is possible to produce power alcohol on a commercial basis from prickly pear, molasses, and other crops, as well as cassava, we should pass a comprehensive measure to encourage activity in all those directions. In view of the remarks that have been made by honorable members during the last ten minutes, I feel strongly that the Minister would be well advised to defer consideration of the bill. The honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) and others who represent similar constituencies are naturally anxious that the matter should be dealt with speedily, but that is no excuse for honorable members voting for it without having full information. We may go just a little too fast in our anxiety to establish this industry. I ask the Minister to permit the matter to remain in abeyance until the Public Accounts Committee has submitted its report, notwithstanding the remark of the Chairman that it cannot interfere with the scope of the bill. I cannot imagine the report of the committee having any bearing on the scope of any bill, but I can understand the Government extending the scope of a bill in consequence of information submitted by such a committee. I have no objection to the bill, but we should have the fullest information, including that obtained by the Public Accounts Committee. After the report of that committee has been received - and I understand it will be at an early date - this measure could be passed in a short time. It would be in the interests of the Commonwealth if the prickly pear plant, which is a pest, could be used in the production of power alcohol, and thus reduce the expenditure incurred in its eradication.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I submit that it is not the duty of this House to say whether a. company is right or wrong in investing £50,000 of its own money in the production of this spirit. Before coming to such a decision the company must have gone into the whole subject most exhaustively, and satisfied itself that there is something in it. All that is proposed under this measure is to pay a bounty on the production of the spirit. This may be an experiment on the part of the company, but the Commonwealth Acetate of Lime Factory is already producing in Queensland 53,000 gallons of power alcohol from molasses. According to the inquiries conducted by the Institute of Science and Industry, 69 gallons of power alcohol are produced from 1 ton of molasses, whereas 39 gallons are produced from 1 ton of cassava. If the company is satisfied that it can make the proposition a payable one with a bounty of 4d. a gallon on power alcohol produced from cassava, this Parliament should give it assistance. I cannot see that any usefulpurpose will be served by delaying the bill in any way. If the company is prepared to invest its money in the project, we have nothing to fear, as it is proposed to pay the bounty only on thepower alcohol actually produced.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

154,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BRENNAN, Frank","JSC","N/A","N/A","N/A",1659,"- No. I speak in no fear at all, although with a conscious recognition of the fact that we are not nowpermitted to discuss the merits and demerits of the bill itself, but merely the proposal to submit it to a. select committee for further inquiry. If it were not for this limitation of debate, I should like to digress for a few moments to speak upon Australian industries generally, concerning which we have heard so much lately. In applauding the establishment of Australian industries, one wonders whether sufficient consideration is given to the effect upon the Australian people, or only an interested and not very large section. The honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser), taking a narrower but equally patriotic view of the interests of those in the environs of Wide Bay, says that the production of power alcohol would be of assistance to a very important industry in Queensland. If it is half as important as he states it to be, one would think that that industry had become sufficiently established by this time to sustain itself without coming to the Commonwealth Treasury for further support. The honorable member for Macquarie (Mr. Manning) and other honorable members deprecate delay. We know that delay is dangerous, but in this instance it may be beneficial to have further inquiry. There are ideas which although they may have originated as long ago as the time of Tiberius Gracchus are still unrealized, and one may hope that they will remain so to the day of general judgment. That is to say in some circumstances delay may be applauded, instead of condemned. In this instance further deliberation may be of advantage, and we should at least have the opportunity for it which the adjournment for luncheon will afford. I understand that it is proposed to pay a bounty on the production of power aclohol from certain commodities, of some of which, such as potatoes, I have heard, whereas others, as cassava, were unknown to me until this bill came before the House. Few honorable members will admit such ignorance, but this is indeed a very intricate subject, and we ought to have further information concerning it. I whole-heartedly support every argument adduced by the. honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) in favour of obtaining further information - not only those arguments which, according to you, Mr. Speaker, were in order, but also - if I may do so - those which were not in order. The latter, indeed, seemed to me to be more convincing than those that were relevant to the motion. It is not customary - though, no doubt, quite correct - to agree to the second reading of a bill and then to discuss a motion to refer the bill to a select committee. In my experience this procedure is unprecedented. But in committee on the bill I shall be free to comment upon some of the products to which it relates. If we can make the measure sufficiently comprehensive to include other pests than prickly pear, by using them for the production of power alcohol, we should do so. Possibly power alcohol may be produced from rabbits; I do not know. In my electorate there is neither prickly pear nor rabbits, but there are a number of taxpayers who are interested in these matters. They have given me a commission - which I regretfully admit may all too soon expire - to represent their interests here, and to inquire into the manner in which their money is being spent. They wish to know how the general public will benefit by this expenditure. An industry of great Australian importance from the point of view of the honorable member for Macquarie (Mr. Manning) and the honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser), may be of little importance to the citizens in the electorate of Batman. Having further considered thiB matter during the luncheon adjournment, we should return with our minds clarified and our patriotism quickened, and should be able to profitably consider- whether the use of prickly pear, sweet potatoes, and other materials in the manufacture of power alcohol, and in the interests of pure patriotism, should be stimulated by the extension of the proposed bounty at the expense, among others, of my electors.

157,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","N/A","N/A","N/A",1660,"- It would enable us to ascertain whether it is politic, in the interests of the people of Australia, to embark upon this proposal. I regard this as an attempt to insert a wedge, with a view to obtaining other large bounties in future, or the imposition of a duty on petrol entering Australia. Realizing the enormous quantity of petrol that is required in Australia, we are justified in seeking some assurance that we are proceeding along right lines. The honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) has stated that this company is prepared to spend £1,000,000 in the industry. Yet a paltry £5,000 is offered as an inducement to it to carry on! It is asserted that the Institute of Science and Industry has reported favorably upon this proposal. Where is that report? I do not know anything of it. It should be in the possession of this House. What evidence was taken by the Institute, and what is its opinion ? We have been assured that the proposal has the recommendation of the Tariff Board. The honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) has had an opportunity to peruse the report of that board, and he finds that it examined only two witnesses, but one of whom advocated this proposal. What is the nature of the evidence that was given? Some honorable members are taking up an extraordinary attitude. A short delay would not cause injustice to those who have been promised the bounty, nor would it prejudice the establishment of the industry. I would agree to the matter being referred io the Committee of Public Accounts for a specific report. My name has been included amongst the names of those who, it is suggested, should comprise the select committee. I have no desire to go upon that committee, and I should do so only from a sense of public duty. Even though only a small bounty is promised in the beginning, the industry may develop rapidly, and make the Commonwealth liable for the payment of. a much larger bounty in future, or the imposition of a duty upon imported motor spirit.

Surely the honorable member does not suggest that he is satis-] led 1, with the recommendation of that board, seeing that it has examined only two witnesses, one of whom is an interested party, and the other recommended that a bountry sshould be granted upon the production of motor spirit from prickly pear ! I have another reason for wishing that an inquiry should be held. I have in my hand an extract from the Scientific Journal dealing with the production of au efficient motor fuel for tractors. In it particular reference is made to the Nipa palm, which grows in North Borneo. The article reads -Considerable work baa been done_ in Philip; pine Islands in ascertaining the suitability of this palm for the production of alcohol, and, according to advices, quite recently an experimental plant has been erected in the state of North Borneo. The plant is being run under the direction of the local Department ofAgriculture, and an account of the results of the first years working, based on a memorandum supplied by the British-North Borneo Company, is given in the current number of the Bulletin of the Imperial Institute, published by Mr. John Murray. There are about 300,000 acres of nipa palm in North. Borneo, occurring in nearly solid stands of 5,000 acres or more. The sap flows for only six months in the year, but it is estimated that during thiB period 900,000,000 gallons of aap, capable of producing nearly 60,000,000 gallons of alcohol, could be obtained. The results of the first years working of the experimental plant came up to expectations in every way. The still was only capable of producing 100 gallons of alcohol per working day of twelve hours, and the costs of running such a small plant were naturally somewhat high, but it is shown that a permanent plant producing not less than 1,000 gallons per day should prove a commercial success. Estimates are quoted in the article of the cost of production for plants of various capacities. For a plant capable of producing 2,000 gallons per day of 12 hours the capital required iis estimated at about £20,000, und the profits on the spirit delivered in Singapore or Hong Kong would be equivalent to a dividend of 10 per cent, on the capital. An 8,000 gallon plant run for 24 hours per day would require a capital of about £122,000, and this, it is estimated, would yield profits equivalent to 30 per cent, on the capital.I am not acquainted with the properties of the Nipa palm, but is there not a probability that it, and other plants which are capable of producing power alcohol, can be grown in some of the tropical parts of Australia? My chief concern is to ascertain what is going to be the national aspect of this matter. How will it affect production in Australia and the building up of this country? There should be a delay sufficiently long to enable the Committee of Public Accounts to report to Parliament upon its investigations to date, so that Parliament may know the exact position that has been reached, and may be advised of the action that ought to be taken in future.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[10]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe in the encouragement of industries by way of bounty rather than by the imposition of a duty. A great deal has been said regarding the lack of information touching this matter.I understand that the Queensland Government has investigated it, and is prepared to advance £25,000 to enable the industry to be established. A private company is prepared to invest in it £50,000 for a start. It would be foolish to expect them to do so if they had not convinced themselves by investigation that the proposition was a sound one. The Commonwealth Government is merely being asked to pay a bounty provided the article is produced. It will take no risks, and will be under no handicap. If the company fails, no bounty will be paid. I cannot, therefore, see any reason for thisstorm in a teacup. The granting of a bounty may assist the development of Queensland, and be the means of employing a considerable number of people in the production of an article that is extensively required all over the world. I consider that this Parliament would be lacking in its duty if it did not consent to the establishment of that industry. Are honorable members prepared to assert that the Queensland Government would be willing to advance £25,000 without having investigated the matter? What will be gained by a further investigation? This is a new industry, and a. great deal of information relating to it is not available. I do not attach much weight to the fact that only two witnesses were examined by the Tariff Board. That board had from the company evidence to the effect that it was prepared to invest its money in the undertaking.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Mr. Board told the Accounts Committee that that rate is sufficient for power alcohol produced from cassava, but we have no definite information as to what bounty would be required in respect of power alcohol produced from prickly pear or molasses. Until the Minister is in possession of facts which will permit him to estimate what rate of bounty is necessary in respect of power alcohol from those sources he is powerless to do anything further.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[12]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I and many other honorable members on this side of the House favour the payment of a bounty on power alcohol, but we are not prepared to endorse piece-meal legislation such as this bill seems to be. However, if the Minister will agree to postpone the later stages of the bill until the Public Accounts Committee has presented its report, I shall vote against the motion for the appointment of a select committee.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I understand that he desires the bill to be investigated by a select committee because he considers that the House is not sufficiently well informed regarding the technical aspects of the production of power alcohol. Still this Parliament is asked, not to produce power alcohol, but merely to pay a bounty to those who do succeed in producing it. Surely the production of the bounty is easier than the production of the spirit. I desire Australia to become self-contained in respect of all vital necessaries, and on principle I shall support the bill. If the company produces no alcohol the Commonwealth will pay no bounty. Therefore, I cannot understand the objection to the bill. I think, however, that its scope should be widened. There are in Western Australia several growths which are at present regarded as noxious, but which I believe are capable of producing power alcohol, and I hope that the bill will be amended to include them.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

186,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MANN, Edward","KMQ","Perth","N/A","N/A",1664,".- I have been somewhat surprised at the trend of the debate on this motion. The frequent interpositions of the Chair seem to indicate that honorable members have hardly grasped either the purpose or the scope of the proposed committee. The House is asked to decide whether the bill should go direct to a committee of the whole, or to a select committee, which would makespecial inquiry into the subject-matter of the measure. My speech upon the second reading was a carefully-prepared exposition of the many difficulties surrounding this proposal and the need for further investigation which cannot be undertaken by a committee of the whole, because many of the questions involved are technical and economic, and are wider in their scope than many honorable members have been prepared to acknowledge. It is impossible to arrive at a reliable judgment upon them without the hearing of evidence. And the real value of evidence can be tested only by cross-examination and a comparison of the opinions of different experts. A committee of the whole cannot hear evidence of that sort. To-day all sorts of statements have been made; most of them were open to grave doubt, and some were capable of contradiction, and even positive disproof. Yet they were accepted without inquiry or examination. That is not the wayin which this House should deal with legislation for the expenditure of public money. We have been told that Parliament need not be concerned in the failure or success of the company. But surely we have a right to determine the principles governing the payment of moneys from the national exchequer. The question before us is not whether cassava can be grown in Australia or whether alcohol can be produced from it, but whether the proposal contained in the bill is founded on right principles. I expected the Minister to give a categorical reply to the various arguments I advancedin favour of referring the bill to a select committee, but after having made a few casual remarks he sat down without having attempted to deal with my contentions. All that I can say is that, if the House is prepared to vote on the question in that way, it is perfectly useless for honorable members to exercise their ability and industry to help it in arriving at a sound decision. The Minister objects to the reference to a select committee for the extraordinary reason that the gentleman principally concerned in this business is in England wanting to buy machinery, and therefore there should be no delay. By interjection I asked whether the gentleman referred to had any authority or guarantee from the Government, because if he has no such guarantee or authority it is no business of ours to avoid delay. Of course, if the Governments word is pledged in this regard, I can understand the Ministers anxiety to avoid delay, but it is distinctly improper that we should be asked not to give thorough consideration to legislation placed before us on the ground that some individual is in England seeking to invest his money. Speaking of the need for technical evidence, one honorable member complained that Mr. De Bavay had not given evidence. In reply the Minister said that he had not offered to do so, yet this morning he told us that he had been in close touch with Mr. De Bavay, and that that gentleman had said this propositon was all right. In fact, the Minister asked us to accept the bill on the recommendation of Mr. De Bavay, although the gentlemans name has appeared in the press over a statement claiming that the bounty proposed to be given would be insufficient for the purpose. The House is asked to accept the bill on evidence of that kind. I was shocked to think that it would even consider the proposal for five minutes.We have also- been told that there is no need for a select committee, because this matter has already- been investigated by the Public Accounts Committee, whose report upon it is due shortly. This, again, is a fact which has just come to light. I admit that some honorable members knew unofficially that the Public Accounts Committee was engaged on this inquiry. But if the Minister was also aware of it, why did he hurry on with this bill and try to get it through before the committees report was presented? During the course of this debate we have been advised that a select committee is unnecessary, and that the House should agree to refer the matter to the Public Accounts Committee. I am pleased to hear that it is being investigated by that committee, and I do not propose for one second to criticize the committee or to suggest any criticism of its report; but how do we know what is likely to be the nature of ite report ? Its chairman (Mr. .Bayley) has said that the committees report will not bear on the principles contained in this bill, whereas the whole of my argument is that there should be some inquiry into those principles, and I cannot see how even the Public Accounts Committee can deal with them in the way I have suggested that they should be dealt with. I should like to know whether the committee has investigated any of the points I mentioned during my second-reading speech, and if it has not done so, I should like to know its reason for not doing so, because the matters I have put forward are of vast importance, and the onus of proving their case is on the other side. If the Public Accounts Committee has not investigated those aspects of the case which I have set forth, we ought not to remain- in ignorance concerning them. The Minister has given no reason why they should not be investigated, and so far no honorable member has given any reason why we should not have the investigation for which I am asking. I have said repeatedly that I am prepared to sit upon a select committee with an open mind and hear any statement any individual likes to make. I would allow the members of the Tariff Board and the Institute of Science and Industry to bring forward their technical knowledge in an endeavour to refute my assertions.But the Minister asks honorable members to abide by the report of the Public Accounts Committee, which, according to the chairman of the committee, has not dealt with any of these matters. We are told that there is no need for a select committee because we ought to take the word of a certain company which is prepared to risk its own capital. That remark came from the Opposition benches. On other occasions honorable members opposite are prepared to attack every large corporation on the ground that it possesses capital. They are ready to regard with suspicion everything such a corporation does, and to declare that its opinion should not be accepted. Yet to-day they are willing to accept, without inquiry, the opinion of -yat* corporation whose capital may be involved in this venture. As a proof that there is reason for inquiry, I may state that to-day I have learned that this company, which has always been known to us under some other name, is apparently closely related to the great Distillers Company Limited which the Minister said this morning had recently increased its capital to about £15,000,000. If this experiment in the growth of cassava is not likely to cost more than £5,000, surely to goodness a company with a capital of £15,000,000 could afford to stand the cost of it without having to come to the Commonwealth Parliament for this bounty. A select committee could find out exactly what are the interests of this company. At any rate, we should not accept the statements of interested people without further and fuller inquiry. In my speech on the second reading I said that the reports of the Institute of Science and Industry on power alcohol were out of date, and I gave reasons for saying so. Yet, the Minister who has the officers of the institute at his disposal, has not produced any later figures to refute my statements. He has mentioned the Tariff Boards report. That report has not been available to honorable members. Is the Minister entitled to come here and say that this board has recommended a certain thing, and that we must accept the bill on what the board has recommended without inquiry into the ground on which its recommendation is based. If ever a ca% has been put up to show the necessity for the examination of such reports as these, it has been put up to-day. The recommendation of the Tariff Board in this respect is not worth a snap of the fingers, and if its report is an example of the methods employed, and the knowledge possessed by the Tariff Board, it does not do that body any credit. The claim has been set up to-day that a report of a select committee would be useless, because as proposed to be constituted its members would bring in a majority and a minority report. That is an improper suggestion. But even if it were true, I should like to ask how the bill will be dealt with other than on a majority vote. In any case the point raised has no bearing. If the evidence given is properly collected, sifted, and analyzed, it will furnish honorable members with a basis on which to form an opinion. The honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) has gone so far as to say that a select committee could obtain no information of value. With all due respect to the honorable member, I say that his remark was a most improper one. How can he assert that the information given to the committee will be valueless? The truth is that the honorable member does not want information. He would rather remain in the dark. He is not in a position to express an opinion as to the relative value of two sources of opinion with regard to one of which he is entirely ignorant. I do not think there is any need for me to labour the matter any further. I expressed myself very freely on the second reading. I have shown that to-days debate has not touched in any sense upon the grounds on which I claim there is need for a select committee. I hope sincerely that the House will face the question, as far as it possibly can, quite apart from party feelings. We have a very grave principle to decide in regard to the disposal of public funds. The bill before us is but the thin end of the wedge. It has been said that honorable members do not mind how much is spent in this direction, and we know perfectly well that the amount in this case will be far above the insignificant sum now involved : but a greater principle is involved. Therefore. I urge honorable members to try to look at this matter in a detached way, realizing that the responsibility rests on them to sift all these things to the bottom. If we take no notice of objections that are urged, declaring that it is unnecessary for us to seek information, the House will become more easily the prey of any clever rogue who wishes to work a swindle on us. I do not suggest that this is a clever swindle, but I wish to go into the matter and sift some of the statements that have been made to the House. Some of those on which we have been asked to vote have proved so unstable and unsatisfactory that one begins to be suspicious of all those on which the measure rests. I hope that the House will support me in my request for a select committee.","N/A","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

190,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HOWSE, Neville","KI7","Calare","NAT","N/A",1667,"- (6y leave). - From June and July of this year many honorable members opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton), the honorable members for Reid (Mr. Coleman), and Ballarat (Mr. McGrath), and a number of honorable members on this side of the House, have asked for information of the intention of the Government in connexion with the recommendations of the royal commission on the assessment of war service disabilities, made on the 22nd December last. I propose now to make a definite statement to the House. As honorable members have not been furnished with copies of the recommendations, it is necessary I should read them. Generally speaking, it may be said that the royal commission arrived at the opinion that the act is being administered sympathetically, and that the claimants are receiving the fullest possible measure of relief permitted by an honest interpretation of the act. The finding of the royal commission is summarized in paragraph 12 of the report, which states -After full and careful inquiry into all matters arising out of the reference, your commissioners unanimously agree that, in the majority of cases, the present machinery for determining disability and assessing pension ia sufficient.There are, however, certain types of disabilities present in a small minority of ex-soldiers which are for various reasons inadequately determined. The inadequacy to some extent has been due to defects in the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act, sections 22 and 40. In some cases rulings made with the object of facilitating the grouping of cases have been found in course of time to operate harshly in exceptional cases, and some unavoidable delay has occurred in determining suitable alterations or modifications required. Section 22 of the act states -The rate of pay of the member means the rate of pay received by the member of the forces as a member at the time of the occurrence of the casualty or the contraction of the disease which resulted in his death or incapacity, and includes such allowances as are prescribed by the regulations under the act.The royal commission recommended the amendment of this section to provide that a pension shall be payable in accordance with the members rank on discharge, and not at the time of occurrence.","N/A","REPATRIATION : ASSESSMENT OF WAR SERVICE DISABILITIES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

192,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HOWSE, Neville","KI7","N/A","N/A","N/A",1667,"- It means, of course, that payment in respect of the disability will be estimated, not upon the rank held at the time when the disability was received, but, assuming that subsequent to the disability the ex-soldier had been promoted, upon the rank held at the time of the granting of the pension. As this amendment would mean only a difference of about 3d. a week - pension rates for ex-soldiers from privates to lieutenants (inclusive), as prescribed by the act, are the same - it is not considered advisable to amend the act as suggested. The consideration is too small. Section. 40 of the act reads - ..... a pension shall not be payable in respect of the death of a person .... after the expiration of seven years from the date of his discharge, except to the widow and children of that person, and unless the person died from the result of an ocurrence happening during the period he was a member of the forces, and was at the time of his death in receipt of a pension.The royal commission recommended that section 40 of the act be deleted as unnecessarily hampering the repatriation administration, which can be relied upon to estimate the value of time in assessing claims. I think it was not recognized at the time that the Repatriation Commission had had this matter under consideration, and had dealt with it by regulation 89 o, which came into operation on the 12th May, 1925. Actually this regulation gives effect to the recommendation of the royal commission.The recommendation in paragraph 16 a is to the following effect: -That an allowance, in addition to the present pension, be paid to blinded soldiers for an attendant.When making this recommendation, the royal commission overlooked the fact that the Repatriation Commission had, by a regulation gazetted in October, 1924, provided for the payment of an allowance of 20s. a week to a totally blinded soldier, and also, if the services of an attendant should be considered necessary, to a soldier whose eyesight is, in the opinion of the Repatriation Commission, so defective that he has no useful sight. This allowance is paid whether the services of an attendant are utilized or not, so that an ex-soldier with a wife or grown-up daughter may have the benefit of their assistance, and receive the same allowance as if he were obliged to pay an attendant.We come now to the crux of the whole question. Honorable members, I know, are anxious to ascertain the views of the Government with reference to tubercular oases. The commission recommends -A permanent pension insome degree be paid where tuberculosis has resulted from war service.The Government has decided to accept this recommendation, and it will be given effect to from the 1st July last.","N/A","REPATRIATION : ASSESSMENT OF WAR SERVICE DISABILITIES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Each of these men will receive at least £2 2s. a week independent of his condition as disclosed on re-examination. He will only be re-examined for his own benefit, so that he will know what progress he has made, and be told the line of treatment he should pursue. The pension will not be reduced under any circumstances, even if, as I said yesterday, he is one of the fortunate individuals who show some progress towards cure; nor will it be reduced when he is ultimately cured.Paragraph 16 c of the commissions recommendations refers to repatriation form  K, which is filled in when exsoldiers are medically examined. The form recommended could be introduced, but it would not be of any benefit to the soldiers. The form which was viewed by the royal commission had been replaced, as a result of experience, by a more comprehensive one before the commission took evidence. The revised form was instituted after comparison had been made between the previous form and those in use by the British and New Zealand Governments. It is considered that the new form is quite sufficient. The form suggested by the royalcommission would be suitable for a general stocktaking of health, but is not considered necessary from the pointof view of the Repatriation Commission or the exsoldiers concerned. It would be of distinct benefit in a stocktaking, so to speak, of the physical health of the community, but that is not the duty, nor could it be carried out under the province of the Department of Repatriation. It belongs to the Department of Health, which has been so freely criticized within the last two or three days, and that criticism, I hope, will result in some progress in the health administration.Now I come to paragraphs 16 d and e, which refer to the steps taken in connexion with cases of venereal disease, and read as follow: -Steps should be taken to ensure that ex-soldiers who have had venereal disease, especially syphilis, continue to present themselves for treatment till the medical officers are satisfied with their condition. (This is a matter as much in their own interest as in that of future generations.)Ruling 83(4) which prescribes in regard to venereal disease that the Repatriation Commission will not accept responsibility for treatment . . on account of any effects of these diseases in whatever form they may appear ... be amended, and full responsibility accepted for the treatment of venereal diseases contracted before discharge from service.The royal commission in its quotation from Ruling 83 (4) of the Repatriation Commission had evidently not noticed an addition to that ruling, which was adopted by the Repatriation Commission on the 8th October, 1923, namely - except where the commission is satisfied that the nature of the shock and strain of war service has materially influenced the onset of their latent sequelae.The sequelae are often delayed, it may be for ten, fifteen, or twenty years.","N/A","REPATRIATION : ASSESSMENT OF WAR SERVICE DISABILITIES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is one other recommendation, to which I desire to refer, namely, 16 j, which is as follows:-That where it is necessary to appoint a trustee for the pension of alcoholics, it should be a public officer rather than a wife or a personal friend.This is practically the only recommendation by the commission with which I disagree. The Chairman of the Repatriation Commission tells me that there are a great number of cases in which the wife, by reason, of her special qualifications and control over her husband, is the most suitable person to act as the trustee for the children. This is a discretionary power which must be left with the Repatriation Commissioners. The Royal Commissioners point out clearly the work that they are doing, and I refer honorable members to the findings of the commission.I am very pleased to say that there are certain aspects of the work of repatriation which are most gratifying. I find that the total death-rate amongst soldiers who are receiving pensions is no greater than amongst the civilian community. This is a most satisfactory state of affairs, and was not foreseen when the Repatriation Acts were passed. Honor able members may ask why is there an increase every year in the expenditure on the department, since the war has been over for seven years. It was estimated that the third year would be the peak period in connexion with all payments in connexion with the war, but we now find that we have not yet reached the peak. Last year was more costly than the previous twelve months, and if I administer the Repatriation Act for the remainder of this Parliament there will probably be an increased expenditure to the extent of between £100,000 and £200,000 for which the Government will have to make provision.","N/A","REPATRIATION : ASSESSMENT OF WAR SERVICE DISABILITIES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The women and children were weeping bitterly on the wharf at the prospect of being sent from their own country to a country they had never seen, and among people whose language they did not know. I could not help thinking of the remark of Abraham Lincoln, who, when he saw women being sold on the slave block in New Orleans, said,  If ever I get a chance to knock that system, I will knock it.

We are not expecting a war to-morrow, and surely it would not affect the position if this bill, which purports to make uniform the laws respecting nationality within the Empire, were delayed until next Wednesday.Mr.FENTON (Maribyrnong) [3.49]. - The Attorney-General has laid great stress upon the necessity for uniformity in respect of nationality lawswithin the Empire, but surely that does not preclude us from passing legislation that may be a little out of harmony with that existing elsewhere, if we consider it a desirable advance. We have set an example in legislation in many ways - in respect of our franchise, for instance - and if we can make a greater advance respecting the relative rights of men and women, let us do so by all means. There is no need for us to confine ourselves to absolute uniformity in regard to our laws and those of the rest of the Empire.Clause agreed to.Clauses 2 to 4 agreed to.Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.Bill, by leave, read a third time.","Second Reading","NATIONALITY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
