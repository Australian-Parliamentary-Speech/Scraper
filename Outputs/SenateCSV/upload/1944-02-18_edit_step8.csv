If not, would a cut in thB existing Australian ration have that desirable result? What is the minimum amount of meat per capita a week necessary to maintain Australian health standards? I am now in a position to inform the honorable senator that the answers to his questions are as follows: - The introduction of meat rationing in Australia was designed to allow Australia to play a necessary part, which, after all, is a relatively small part in the provision of meat for the United Kingdom. As the population of the United Kingdom is six times the population of Australia, it will be appreciated that it would require a reduction of 0 oz. a head in Australia to provide an additional ounce a head in the United Kingdom. The Nutrition Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council was asked to report as to the minimum quantity of meat at which the civilian ration could be set. The committee advised that a meat ration of 2.2 lb. per week, for persons over nine years of age and half that amount for persons under nine was sufficient to satisfy nutritional requirements. Cabinet decided to set a ration very slightly higher than this, viz., at21/4 lb. of meat for adults and11/8 lb. for children under nine.","MEAT RATIONING","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Tobacco rations for prisoners of war comprise second and third grades of tobacco only. The normal method of distribution of tobacco to prisoners of war by the Australian Defence Canteens Services is to transfer hulk quantities either weekly or fortnightly to the prisoners' town canteens from the services issuing points at the camp concerned, the method of distribution to individuals thus becomes the prisoners' own responsibility.

The bill does not purport to provide normal incomes for breadwinners. This is another matter altogether, to which the Government is giving its most earnest attention. The purpose of the bill is to provide a safeguard against temporary interruptions of earnings. Let us consider what the amendment if adopted would mean in terms of weekly payments. First, take sickness benefit. In the case of the payment of sickness benefit for an incapacity whichwas not the reason for the granting of his war pension, a pensioner could receive under the amendment the full benefit, for a man, his wife and his children, £2 10s. a week; the exempted portion of his war pension, £1 5s- a week; and other allowable income, £1 a week, making a total of £4 15s. a week. In addition, the pensioner might be a member of a lodge and receive an additional £1 a week from that source, making the grand total £5 15s. a week, while absent from work through sickness. Where the incapacity of the pensioner was that for which his pension was paid, he would, generally speaking, be dealt with under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, and not under the provisions of this bill. Turning to unemployment benefits, the position of a war pensioner under the proposed amendment would be that he would receive the full benefit for a man, his wife and his children, amounting to £2 10s. a week, he would be allowed other income up to £1 a week and he would receive the war pension of £1 5s. a week, making a total of £4 15s. a week. The pensioner would thus receive a total of £4 15s. a week under the amendment while unemployed. It should scarcely be necessary for me to tell honorable senators that a fundamental principle in an unemployment benefit scheme is that the incentive to work should be in no way weakened. The arrangements in such a scheme should be such that it would be more profitable for a man to be in work than out of work. This is self-evident, and goes to the root of our economic life. The proposal to exempt part of the war pension, if accepted, would as I have shown mean that a man could receive under the bill a weekly payment equal to or in excess of his average expectation of earnings while in full-time employment. As the bill is drawn, a war pension up to £1 a week can be received without affecting the payment of full benefit. A considerable number of pensioners do not receive more than £1 a week in the form of a war pension, and, therefore, those breadwinners will continue to receive their full pension while unemployed, without their unemployment benefit being affected. This, I submit, is a fair provision. When considering the position of war pensions in common with that of all other workers, it must be remembered that the provisions of the bill are directed to one aspect only of the general problem of economic security. The Government is pressing on with its plans to ensure that industry reaches a high pitch of activity after the war. Every endeavour will be made to attain and maintain the highest possible level of employment. Arrangements will be made to ensure that soldiers and other workers will have every opportunity to obtain suitable employment. The Government cannot accept the amendment.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The adoption of the amendment would result in a payment which would encourage idleness, despite all checks that might be used. As the Minister has shown, provision is made for a fair proportion of the war pension to be retained, and, in the event of a pensioner being placed in a worse position through a disability not arising from war service, the matter would be dealt with by the Repatriation Department. I .think that we can agree on that point. A soldier will not be concerned in the application of this new legislation. The figures that have been quoted show that if the amendment be carried he will be able to get the full benefit of £2 10s. a week. The exempted portion of his war pension is £1 5s. a week. Other income amounting to £1 a week makes the total £4 15s. a week. In addition, he may receive £1 a week as a member of a friendly society.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I confess that, when Senator Wilson moved his amendment, there seemed to be a good deal in it, but, after examination I find that the position is different. 'The object of the bill is to provide a safeguard against temporary interruption of earnings; it does not purport to provide normal incomes for breadwinners. In the majority of cases that have come to my notice a war pension does not greatly exceed £1 a week. My view concerning war pensions is the same as my attitude towards men injured in industry. I have consistently advocated that a man mangled in industry should be a charge on industry. Similarly, a man who receives injuries in the service of his country cannot receive a pension big enough to compensate him for his loss.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

If the Minister will examine the bill, he will find that a working man with three children will receive £1 5s. unemployment benefit, and his wife another £1. He will be permitted to earn £1 a week, and it may be that the three children earn between them as much as £6 a week, out of which say £1 10s. a week may be paid by each of them for keep.

Such exemptions include the maternity allowance and child endowment. In paragraph c, the principle which Senator Wilson wishes to embody in this billhas been given away. That paragraph reads, ' in relation to a person qualified to receive sickness benefit, any payment made in respect of the incapacity in respect of which that person is so qualified '. The benefits referred to are benefits to which the persons referred to are entitled under the law; in respect of paragraph a and b they are benefits to which they are entitled under specific legislation, and as regards c they are benefits to which they are entitled under certain other legislation which is current throughout the Commonwealth. The underlying principle is that those benefits are secured to the individual by certain specified laws. Under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and other legislation certain benefits accrue to soldiers. What distinction can the Minister draw between a civilian suffering from an incapacity which entitles him to a benefit under certain legislation passed by this Parliament, and a soldier who, because of a war-caused incapacity, is entitled to a payment under other legislation passedby this Parliament? I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Senate say that he was impressed last night by the arguments advanced in favour of Senator Wilson's amendment, and I hope that he will continue to be impressed by. the logic of those arguments. No good reason can be advanced for not accepting the amendment. The wording of paragraph c is not wide enough to cover the benefit referred to by Senator Wilson, and therefore he desires to enlarge the ambit of these exemptions. I cannot understand why the amendment should he resisted. This Parliament has always been in favour of allowing returned soldiers to have certain benefits free from other charges. Here is an opportunity to continue that practice. Having regard to the enormous sums of money which would be involved in the event of widespread unemployment, or sickness on a large scale, the amount in question is not likely to be large. I cannot see any distinction whatever between the principle embodied in paragraph c and that for which Senator Wilson contends.I shall support the amendment.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

That fund was created by means of a special tax, 'and the Labour party incurred 'a great deal of odium by agreeing to tax the lower range of incomes. The -criticism was particularly virulent against us, because we had always claimed that 'we did not stand for such taxation, but we found that, in Order to establish the fund, we had apparently to depart from our age-old policy.

I contend that the first essential of a measure such as this is that it should offer some real security to the prospective beneficiaries; secondly, it should be on a contributory basis. We all know that when the Government introduced legislation providing for the setting up of a National Welfare Fund. it did so for a specific purpose. The Government was not willing to invade the lower incomes for taxation purposes solely to finance the war. It had to put a sugar coating on the pill, in the form of promises that if the low wage-earners submitted to these taxes, they would be recompensed in the future by means of social services. The proposal was that £30,000,000 should be put into a special fund every year to finance social service schemes which were to be brought into operation from time to time; but last night the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) made the most astonishing admission that the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) had already raided this fund. Of course we all knew that the money would not be put into that fund and allowed to remain there untouched, but that it would be used for the real purpose for which it was collected, namely the prosecution of the war - and a very proper purpose too. However, we find now that before any of the schemes for which the fund was constituted have been brought into operation, the fund has already been tapped. I suggest that we cannot hold very much hope for security in the future, if in time of war, when money is obtainable from the public and from other sources in amounts which would be regarded as fantastic in time of peace, the Treasurer finds his financial difficulties such that he has to raid this fund. I do not propose to mislead the people of this country by supporting a measure of this kind, based as it is upon unsound financial principles. I believe that social services should be financed by direct contributions, and, personally, I favour the New Zealand or the British scheme, but in any case, I appose this clause because it . is mere sham and humbug for the .Minister for Social Services (Senator Fraser) to say that the prospective beneficiaries are already contributing to this scheme. If the Government is sincere in this matter, let it dissect income-tax payments so that every taxpayer will know the amount which he is contributing to social services. Then the obligation would .be upon the Treasurer to ensure that the money which he has collected foi social services has been used for that purpose. For the Minister to' say that this is a contributory scheme because all taxpayers are already contributing to it is misleading. This measure does not bring the taxpayer into direct relation with the -benefits which he hopes to receive. On those grounds I shall oppose the clause.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[22]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It must be clear that as taxpayers generally are already contributing to the National Welfare Fund they are contributing towards the benefits which this measure will confer. Honorable senators opposite have not had the courage to move an amendment suggesting anything to take the place of the proposals set out in this provision. They merely say that they disagree with it. The Government is putting forward this measure in the belief that it is the best that can be done; purely, if the Opposition does not agree with any feature of the measure, it should be prepared to suggest something better. Senator- Cooper has said that he would like to see the scheme based upon a graduated income tax, and that everybody should know exactly how much he was contributing to social services and how much to general revenue. If the honorable senator is sincere in that belief, why has he not moved an amendment to that effect? Obviously he is merely shamfighting as is Senator McBride, who prefers the British or the New Zealand seh erne to the one propounded in this measure.

Senator Lamp took exception to the Government bringing within the income tax field persons on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder for the purpose of building up the National Welfare Fund, but when the bill relating to the trust, fund was before the Senate it was pointed out that the Government desired to take advantage of the fact that money was being freely circulated, and an opportunity was afforded to provide the funds needed in order to inaugurate the contemplated social security scheme. Therefore, persons within the income range of from £104 to £156 a year were called upon to pay income tax, to enable the National Welfare Fund to be built up at the rate of £30,000,000 a year. Despite Senator McBride's remarks, under section 62b of the Audit Act the Commonwealth Treasurer has the right to invest trust funds in government securities. The whole of the money raised for the purpose of war damage insurance has been invested in those securities. Indeed, the whole of the contributions to the National Insurance Fund in Great Britain, amounting to £500,000,000, have been so invested. Senator Cooper, who is a member of the Social Security Committee, said yesterday that he favours a graduated income tax for the purpose of providing the funds necessary to finance this scheme. I point out to him that the National Welfare Fund, which will be used for the implementation of the social security plan, has been established by means of such a tax. It is true that the Opposition has advocated contributions to the cost of the scheme on the basis of a flat rate on lines similar to those adopted under the schemes in New Zealand and Great Britain, but the National Welfare Fund was inaugurated in order to avoid the adoption of a flat-rate of contribution. Senator Cooper said that, in order to relieve persons on the lower incomes, he was prepared to accept a scheme financed by means of graduated income tax. We have always had a graduated income tax, and the sum of £30,000,000 is being set aside annually and invested in government securities, on which I presume the trust fund will receive interest. Senator McBride did not tell us whether the Government of the United Kingdom had used the £500,000,000 raised in Great Britain for national insurance purposes. What objection can there be to the raising of the funds needed for our social security measures by means of the present graduated tax on the incomes of the people?","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Sections 5 and 6 of the National Welfare Fund Act read - There shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, for the purposes of the National Welfare Fund, in each financial year commencing with the financial year (commencing on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and forty-three), the sum of Thirty million pounds, or a sum equal to one quarter of the amount received in that financial year as income tax from persons other than companies, whichever is the less. fi.

Any interference with this provision will not be in the interests of the people, or of the Parliament. After all, the benefits to be provided under this measure are to be financed on the principle recommended by the Social Security Committee. That point has been clarified by Senator Arnold. The statutory exemption level for income tax was reduced to £104, not only to enable the Government to finance social service benefits but also because the Government thought that as many >f our citizens as possible should contribute towards the tremendous cost of carrying on the country. That is a sound principle. I believe that as the war draws to a close, the existing rates of income tax must be reconsidered. For instance, the company rate of 18s. 6d. in the £1 must be reconsidered. However, provision has been made to finance social service benefits from income tax. The National Welfare Fund will be policed by the Auditor-General, and the disbursement of benefits will be made by a responsible department under the supervision of the Auditor-General. Therefore, I fail to understand why, at this late date, honorable senators opposite have objected to this clause, which is the most important in the measure.

I repeat that the method of financing these benefits is consistent with the recommendations made by the Social Security Committee.

I disagree with the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) that that is the principle of the method by which the Government now proposes to finance benefits under this measure. I recall that when we were considering the National Welfare Fund legislation, the Treasurer stated that £30,000,000, or 25 per cent, of the total collection of income tax in any year, whichever is the lesser amount, would be paid into the fund, and that the Government's social service programme would be financed from that fund. However, that means that these services are being financed by the payment of a lump sum from revenue, whereas the Social Security Committee recommended that a special tax be imposed for this specific purpose or that a specific proportion of the income tax paid by each individual taxpayer be ear-marked for this purpose.

The main objection of honorable senators opposite to the National Welfare Fund legislation when it was before this chamber, on which measure, by the way, they did not callfor a division, was that the Government was putting the cart before the horse. They wanted to know for what purposes the fund would be used, and the Government's reply was that it had first to provide for the financing of any social service scheme before it could determine the benefits to be provided. It was explained that a sum of £30,000,000 of the income tax collected in a year was to be paid to that fund which was to be used to finance social service benefits. In view of the fact that income tax is imposed on a graduated scale, the Government's method of financing these benefits accords in principle with the method1 which Senator Cooper says the Social Security Committee recommended. That was one of the reasons why the Government reduced the statutory exemption level for income tax to £104. I submit, therefore that it has complied with the recommendations of the Social Security Committee. Thewhole bill hinges on this clause. Honorable senators opposite supported theincrease of taxes to finance the National Welfare Fund, out of which the costs of this scheme were to be met, and that increase of income tax was equivalent to the contributory basis they now advocate. They now say to the people who pay that tax : ' Now that we have the money from you, we shall not allow it to be used for any social benefits such as we agreed to pay '. Their attitude is the greatest piece of -trickery that I have seen perpetrated on the public since I entered this chamber. It is time the public knew the reason why that tax was collected, and the real attitude of the Opposition towards the social benefits which the public has been led to expect. If the Opposition defeats the bill by negativing the clause, it will have taxed by false pretences people earning incomes as low as £104 a year. They obtained £30,000,000 from the people to finance social benefits, and now tell them that they have to pay another £30,000,000 on a contributory basis, making the public's total payment £60,000.000. No wonder the last election resulted as it did, if that is a sample of the stunts and tricks put over by honorable senators opposite. Senator Wilson was eager to amend the bill so that returned soldiers should get something out of it, and wanted even to increase the benefits, but now, by opposing the clause, in effect, he says to the soldiers, 'You are not worthy of any unemployment or sickness benefits unless you help to pay into the Treasury another £30,000,000. You can step into the front line while we stay in the background but, when you come back, if you want a job yon will have to hunt for it yourselves, and if you are sick you can look after yourselves, because I am in favour of throwing out the bill '. That is a nice attitude for a man who preens himself here as a soldiers' representative! He has- turned three somersaults already this morning. He is opposed to clause 15 because it provides unemployment and sickness benefits for foreigners.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

He would deny them any assistance if they were temporarily unemployed or became ill, even though they had helped us to save our country. The honorable senator must know that if we are to hold this country we must increase its population. We cannot ask people to come here if we are not prepared to guarantee them some economic security. The honorable senator would tell them that until they had been here five years they would have to put up with anything that might befall them, and could not look for help from the Government. He must realize that if Australia is to become a strong nation we must offer all of our citizens equality of treatment. It is strange that not long' ago, when the Widows' Pensions Bill, which provides a scheme to be financed out of the National Welfare Fund, was passed, honorable senators opposite did not object to it because the scheme was not contributory. Similarly, when the bill to increase the maternity allowance was before this chamber, they raised no objection to it, although the money was to come from the same fund.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[30]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Such action is a reflection upon our democratic system of government. No matter how strongly honorable senators opposite may oppose this measure it will be passed eventually because, after June next, the Government will have a majority in this chamber. I recall that six years ago, when a certain number of honorable senators who had been rejected at the previous general elections were due to retire, they acted just as their colleagues are acting to-day. On that occasion, the Senate was summoned in the last week of the term of office of several honorable senators so that the then Government would be able to secure the passage of certain legislation. Whilst I would not go so far as to suggest that the Opposition is sheltering behind the three retiring senators because of its fear of action by the electors in the future, nevertheless it is significant that the main opposition to this measure has been voiced by the three gentlemen to whom I have referred.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[31]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Last -year, a National Welfare Fund Bill was passed by this Parliament. Section 3 of that measure states - In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears - 'companies' includes all bodies or associations, corporate or unincorporate but does not include partnerships; ' income tax ' means income tax imposed as such by any Act; * the National Welfare Fund ' means the Trust Account established by this Act and known as the National Welfare Fund. Section 4 reads - There shall be a Trust Account which shall be known as the National Welfare Fund. (2.) The Trust Account established under the last preceding sub-section shall be a Trust Account for the purposes of section sixty-two a of the Audit Act 1901-1634. Although I have the Audit Act before me I do not wish to delay the committee by quoting it. .Section 5 of the National Welfare Fund Act states - There shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, for the purposes of the National Welfare Fund, in each financial year (commencing with the financial year commencing on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and forty -three ) the sum of Thirty million pounds, or a sum equal to one quarter of the amount received in that financial year as income tax from persons other than companies, whichever is the less. (2.) For* the purposes of this section, the amount received as income tax from persons, other than companies, in any financial year during which the States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942 is in operation, shall be deemed to be the total amount so received less Twenty-one million pounds. Then follows a very important section - Moneys standing to the credit of the National Welfare Fund shall be applied in making such payments as are directed by any law of the Commonwealth to be made from the Fund, in relation to health services, unemployment or sickness benefits, family allowances, or other welfare or social services. That measure has been in operation since the middle of last year, and already the fund provided under it has been used to finance certain social services including child endowment and widows' pensions, but when it comes to sickness or unemployment benefits, objections are raised by the Opposition. I cannot understand the objection to this clause. Honorable senators opposite must realize that if it is defeated, that will be the end of the bill for the time being at least.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[31]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I recall that last year when incomes down to £104 per annum were brought into the income tax field for the first time, there was great jubilation amongst honorable senators opposite. I point out, however, that at that time it was made quite clear that the tax was being imposed for a specific purpose, namely, the establishment of a National Welfare Fund. I have listened carefully to the arguments that have been- advanced by honorable senators opposite in this debate, and I challenge any one of them, other than the three who were rejected by the people at the last elections, to state in this chamber his reason for his opposition to this clause. It is a cardinal principle of taxation practice that taxes should be levied upon those who are best able to pay them, yet honorable senators opposite have objected to the method of financing this legislation, namely, a graduated tax upon income. They argue, in effect, that a man who received £10 a week should not contribute any more than the man who earns only £2 a week. Taxation on that basis is devoid of any suggestion of equity. Obviously an individual who earns £10 a week is in a much better position to make a larger contribution than the man who earns only £2 a week. Whether or not this clause is rejected is immaterial, because it will be passed eventually. Honorable members opposite can succeed only in delaying it a few months. The Leader of the Opposition (Senator McLeay) said that he was in full accord with the principles of the bin, but he knows very well that those principles cannot be put into operation unless the necessary finance is provided. We have heard a plea by Senator Wilson on behalf of the soldiers. In fact, every time the honorable senator speaks he waves the flag and appears to be bursting with patriotism and devotion to the soldiers' cause. He says that we were not treating the soldiers generously enough, yet along with other members of the Opposition he is prepared to delay the operation of this measure, and to deprive soldiers of the benefits which would accrue to them under this scheme. He is an obvious supporter of vested interests and objects to this measure because individuals in receipt of high incomes will be compelled to make much larger contributions than less fortunate members of the community.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[31]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

They have displayed an attitude which has done more than anything else to bring this chamber into disrepute. Such an attitude of mind was responsible for the overwhelming victory of the Labour party at the last general election. The people are sick and tired of finessing and political makebelieve. Opponents of the bill ask for the establishment of a separate fund, knowing perfectly well that that would increase administrative charges and cause an extra demand for man-power. At no time has economy in the use of manpower been more necessary than to-day. The exigencies of the times make it imperative for the Government to adopt the course it has followed with regard to this measure. In medieval times the people were denied freedom of access to roads unless they paid a direct toll, but eventually the demands of the people were such that greater freedom of access to roads had to be given and the tax was abolished. A person with an income of £1,000 a year or more has no more right of access to public roads than a person without a penny in his pocket who has made no contribution to the cost of the upkeep of the roads. Honorable senators opposite still advocate the old system that held up progress and irritated the people, to such a degree that ultimately adult franchise was granted. In a time of war we need to economize in every possible way. Senator Cooper considers that the fund in question should be financed separately, but, when the Government attempts to implement the bill in a practical and economical way, stupid objections are raised. The people will no longer tolerate this attitude in time of war. Opponents of the bill also object to the principle that those who draw the larger incomes should make a bigger contribution to the cost of the scheme than people in the lower income groups. Honorable senators opposite ask for a flat rate of tax, so that a person with a low income will pay more in pro portion to a man receiving a high income. It is not surprising that the people became exasperated because of the eternal splitting of straws and raising of political bogies that have been witnessed. Senator A. J. McLachlan made a serious reflection when he said that the Treasurer of the day might use the fund for. purposes other than that for which it had been established.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[33]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

McLachlan, who is a legal luminary, has chosen to reflect on both the Treasurer and the Auditor-General without justification. Political side-play of this kind may be interesting and amusing in time of peace, but in time of war, when the Government desires to get things done in the quickest possible way, and to show the people that it is in earnest in its attempt to provide economic security consistent with our resources, that sort of conduct should not be tolerated. I am astonished that men with years of experience in pub-e life should attempt to waste the time of the Senate by submitting arguments of that kind and indulging in make-believe and pretence. Whilst some persons in the community may accept what they say without question I remind honorable senators opposite that the people generally are now taking a much more intelligent interest in political affairs than they did in the past. They will not all be deceived. At the last elections the people knew the purpose of the National Welfare Fund because from every platform the representatives of the Labour party told them what was intended. In the light of that knowledge, the people returned the Labour Government with an overwhelming majority. Yet the so-called democrats who sit opposite refuse to accept the decision of the people, giving as their ground the possibility of the Treasurer of the day doing this or that. Honorable senators who take that stand claim to be statesmen with intelligence above that of ordinary mortals, but they have merely indulged only in out-of-date political showmanship. I take no pleasure in speaking in this way. This morning I remained silent when I could have spoken, but I see now that honorable senators opposite are at their wits' end to find objections to the Governments proposal. The objections that they advance are purely theoretical; they are not substantial. I believe that Senator Wilson is perfectly sincere in his advocacy of the claims of returned soldiers. I would be the last person to reflect on him in that connexion, but when he says that if he cannot get what he wants he will do his best to assist to defeat the bill I have reason to doubt his sincerity. His attitude is the attitute of Opposition senators generally. As has already been said, it may be possible for honorable senators opposite to delay the passage of this legislation for four months, but not longer. After June, Opposition senators may talk' until they are black in the face, but they will not prevent the Government from giving to the people of this country the greatest possible measure of economic security. The Government realizes that the people to whom it would give that security are those who really count in the nation. There are two groups of people who come within that category, namely, those in the .fighting lines and those in production. They carry the nation, and they are the people to whom we shall give economic security to the fullest degree consistent with the claims of war and the resources of the nation. The bill does not contain any extravagant proposals. Provision is made for an annual expenditure of not more than £30,000,000, and, for a time at least, very few persons in the community will make claims on the fund. When the amount of money involved is set alongside the performances of men and women in the fighting lines and in the sphere of production, honorable senators should be ashamed to oppose this clause. Their opposition to it is an attempt to wreck the bill altogether, and as the Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) has said, it is significant that those who are taking the lend in this matter have been rejected by the people. How petty, how paltry, how contemptible they must appear in the eye» of intelligent people! A person who is defeated in an election should take his defeat with a smile on his face, and not try to hold up a measure which would provide economic security for those who require it most. Yet these self-styled statesmen, these members of the ' old guard ' who are out of date, would like the people to regard them as having intelligence superior to that of the common people. I am impelled to speak in this way because the people look to their representatives in this chamber to act on their behalf. To us has been delegated the power to legislate on behalf of the people; but when we find that elected representatives of the people approach an important subject with a toll-gate mind it is no wonder that the institution of Parliament is in danger of getting into disrepute.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[33]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I sincerely hope that the people of Tasmania will learn of the specious excuses which have been advanced by some honorable senators from that 'State in an attempt to justify their opposition to this bill.

Honorable senators opposite have changed their ground of opposition to this bill two or three times during the course of this debate. Senator Leckie has at last admitted that the fund will be financed directly from a tax on incomes. His specific complaint wa3 that that system did not allow a person to know exactly how much he was paying for the particular benefits to be received under this legislation, and how much he was paying for other benefits. That is an example of the toll-gate mind to which the Minister for Aircraft Production (Senator Cameron) has referred. In days gone by a man who went through a gate knew how much he paid as toll, but to-day the taxpayer who contributes to the upkeep of our main roads does not know what he contributes.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[34]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

There is in operation a graduated income tax on all incomes above £104 a year. Persons in the lower range of incomes pay 6d. a week, whilst others with higher incomes pay much more. If that is the graduated form of tax honorable senators opposite want, then why will they not be honest with themselves, and true to the electors, by supporting the clause? Senator Cooper also advocates a graduated income tax. In order to secure Senator 'Cooper's vote, those who oppose this clause must agree with his contention that there must be a graduated income tax. That tax is already in force. The National Welfare Fund is financed from income tax, which is imposed on the graduated principle. Therefore, to be consistent, honorable senators opposite should support the method by which the Government proposes to finance these benefits. Senator McBride made a wild statement. He said that the National Welfare Fund which was established to finance the Government's social service programme had already been raided. That is an alarming statement from an ex-Minister. He knows that the National Welfare Fund has the backing of the Treasury, and the resources of this country, and that any liability incurred by the Government in respect of that fund will be honored. Therefore, his statement is a gross reflection upon constitutional government in this country. In order to establish that fund the Government brought into the field of income tax incomes as low as £104 a year. We on this side did not relish taking that step. When we did so, honorable senators opposite exclaimed that at last the Labour party had realized that it must tax the lower incomes. We have always contended that the average wage-earner pays tax at the point of production, because he is denied the full fruits of his labour in order that some one might get a ' rake off ' in the form of profit. We have always borne that fact in mind, and we have proceeded on the principle of placing the taxation burden on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. It was not easy for supporters of the Government to explain to the workers the reason why it was compelled to tax lower incomes. Honorable senators opposite thought that they had accomplished a very clever trick when, rather than face the people after defeating the self-same proposal contained in this measure, they precipitated a crisis on another incident, in order to provide an issue which would enhance their chances of success at the ensuing elections. They took the view that in a debate on a censure motion they would be able to throw so much mud at the Labour party in this Parliament that some of that mud would stick. They realized that had their action in frustrating the introduction of these proposals at that juncture been made an issue their chances of return would be hopeless. They opposed the imposition of additional income tax for the purpose of financing social service benefits. On that occasion they accused the Government of tacking, because it made the imposition of such taxes contingent upon the establishment of a National Welfare Fund for financing social service bene fits. Eventually, the Government was obliged to provide for the establishment of that fund independent of taxation legislation. The taxing measure was passed; but, now, the purposes for which additional taxes were imposed, are being attacked again by honorable senators opposite. The Government which was obliged to bear the odium consequent upon its action in taxing lower incomes is now forced to fight hard again in its endeavour to implement the purposes for which that additional taxation was imposed. As I have already said, it was not the easiest thing for supporters of the Government to explain to the lower wage-earners the reasons for that increased taxation. The explanation, of course, is that by paying that tax the wage-earner becomes entitled to social service benefits as & right. I point out to honorable senators opposite that a young man or woman, on reaching the age of sixteen years, when he or she would probably earn £2 a week, would automatically go off their fathers' friendly society list for sickness and hospital benefits. Therefore, they themselves would be obliged to contribute for those benefits.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[34]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The proposed method of financing this scheme conforms in principle with the recommendations made by the Social Security Committee on which is represented every party in this Parliament. That committee was unanimous that something must be done to alleviate social evils; and the Government decided that the people themselves should make some contribution towards the cost of a scheme designed to achieve that objective. To-day, the lower wage-earner is more prepared than he has been in the past to pay income tax, because he knows a portion of that tax will be utilized to finance benefits of this kind. Whilst I dislike some features of this measure, I welcome it as a first instalment of a comprehensive scheme of social service benefits. One effect of this scheme will be to ensure that we shall not again witness great numbers of people queueing up to draw the dole, or food relief. Under this measure they will be eligible to receive, during periods of unemployment and sickness, cash payments to tide them over their distress. For instance, a man and his wife and five children, if they become unemployed, will be guaranteed an income of £5 a week. They will be given that assistance as a right. At one time, I was fearful that honorable senators opposite would be successful at the last general elections. However, I now realize that the people want this Government to guarantee them social security. They want to make certain that never again shall droves of citizens be obliged to walk the streets in search of employment. The bitterest opposition to this measure has come from the three honorable senators from South Australia, two of whom were defeated at the last election, whilst the third failed to obtain the endorsement of the opposition party. I find it difficult to understand why those three gentlemen have been able to impose their will upon the majority of honorable senators opposite. This measure will provide some security for the down-and-out, but those three gentlemen are bitterly opposed to it. It will provide future security for men of the type who filled the ranks of the 6th Division, and who came to the country's aid in its hour of need to work in the factories and workshops providing us with munitions and war materials. However, the three South Australian senators, who will relinquish their seat in this chamber on the 30th June next, have told us that this measure is useless. Senator Wilson could not find one good feature in it. Those three gentlemen have caused all the trouble in this debate. But are they likely to need to apply for assistance under this scheme? Why do they want to defeat it? They wish to block the passage of this measure at least for the remainder of their term of office in this chamber. Two of that trio are well-to-do solicitors, and the third is one of the wealthiest pastoralists in Australia. In condemning this measure, Senator Wilson was guilty of sheer humbug. He makes me sick. He claims to make an appeal on behalf of the soldiers, but what soldiers does he represent? He went away with the 9th Division, but he sticks in head-quarters, although the 9th Division is still in New' Guinea.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[35]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The appeal made by Senator Wilson for the soldiers is so much humbug. There was and is a possibility that consideration will be given to the soldiers under the bill as it stands, because the Director-General will have wide discretionary powers which he can exercise in their favour. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition (Senator McLeay) and others complained about the way in which members of friendly societies were being treated. Some of them, it was urged, would receive 22s. 6d. a week from the societies, but the Government allows them to deduct only £1 a week on that account. There is no sincerity in that argument, because the same honorable senators wanted soldiers to be allowed to deduct their pensions of 25s. a week from their incomes. Why did not they ask for the same concession for members of friendly societies? Why the showmanship? Why try to make capital out of returned soldiers?

Tremendous publicity was given in the press to the fact that the Government intended to extend social benefits to the people, yet now a Senate, many of whose members have been defeated at the polls, is trying to block the legislation which the Prime Minister promised. This is a subtle move on the part of the Opposition to throw out the bill, which is intended to build up an organization to give, at the earliest possible moment after hostilities cease, unemployment and sickness benefits to those who need them. Whatever the Opposition does, I am sure that the Government will not allow the bill to be shelved. The actions of honorable senators opposite in the last Parliament resulted in their undoing at the recent elections in South Australia, and I predict that what they are doing now will result in the defeat of their own party in the South Australian Parliament at the forthcoming elections in that State.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[35]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

He said that I went overseas with the 9th Division and that I have remained behind at head-quarters whilst my unit was fighting in New Guinea. The inference is, of course, that I am not playing my part so far as operational service is concerned. Reluctant though one may bo to talk about one's service, I am compelled to answer the honorable senator. I joined the Army in May, 1940, and went overseas in November, 1940, as a sergeant. I served in action at Mersa Matron for three months in early 1941, when that town was one of the most heavily bombed spots in any theatre of war. I then moved with my regiment - the 2nd/7th Field Regiment - still as a sergeant, to the Libyian border, where I served in action against the enemy at Mersa Matruh, Bug Bug, and Safafi. My regiment then returned to Cairo where, against my wish, but because I was deemed to have special qualifications, I was seconded to head-quarters Australian Imperial Force, Middle East. I made a request to my commanding officer that I be permitted to remain with my unit, but, as honorable senators know, a soldier must do as he is told. Although I was seconded to head-quarters, I was actually commissioned in the 2nd/7th Field Regiment. Subsequently, and still against my desire, I was transferred to head-quarters. Much as I, and many others in head-quarters; would like to join a unit which is performing an operational role, a soldier must obey orders, and, after all, somebody has to do these jobs. Three times now Senator Amour has referred to this matter, inferring that I am sheltering in a head-quarters unit, whereas, as I have pointed out, I served with a unit which was engaged in operations against the enemy for a considerable time. The fact that I am in headquarters is due to a decision made by the Army, and certainly not by me. I think that I am right in saying that practically every man now serving in head-quarters units would be only too happy to have the opportunity to join an operational unit. No soldier that I know of likes to remain in head-quarters in war-time. If a man is in the war, he wants to 'be given ft fighting role, but unfortunately some people have to do these base jobs, and that is why the Army adopts the only practice that it oan follow, and details men who have had some active service, and possess certain specialized knowledge, to serve in head-quarters units. ManyAustralians who have had distinguished careers in the Western Desert, Greece, Crete, Malaya and New Guinea are now in head-quarters, because it is essential to have there the services of men who have had experience in operational work. I have mentioned this matter only because, for some reason or other, Senator Amour seems to be determined to create the false impression that my soldiering career has been spent entirely as an officer in head-quarters, whereas actually that is very far from the truth.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Is it a fact that the Acting DeputyDirector of Personnelfor Tasmania (Mr. G. M. Sommers) called up a number-of men on the 2nd February without permission of the manpower authorities? The answer given by the Minister to the first question was in the negative, indicating that there would be still mors call-ups. The Minister went on to explain that, in view of new urgent projects in the northern areas of Australia, laborers would be required in large numbers and that all southern States would be called upon to supply their quota of medically fit men. In reply to the second question, the Minister said that men called up were always man-powered prior to their enrolment and despatch. I mention this matter because it appears that the various departments concerned are clashing with one another. I have received a letter from the Prime Minister (Mr.Curtin) admitting that men have been called up by the Civil Constructional Corps without reference to the man-power authorities. I also have a letter which I received with the compliments of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway), in. which the Director-General of Personnel of the Allied Works Council, Mr. Packer, advised the Minister, through the Deputy Director, Mr. Bellemore, that there would be no more call-ups for the Civil Constructional Corps at present. These statements have been published, and so has the reply to the questions I asked yesterday. Here we have two departments in conflict with one another, in spite of the fact that the Prime Minister has advised me that, by arrangement with the Premier of Tasmania, no more labour would be taken by the Civil Constructional Corps from that State, except in very special circumstances.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"
