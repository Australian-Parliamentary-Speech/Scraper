I never knowingly made use of -the word 'speech,' but tried to abstain; if the word crept in it was inadvertently. Surely the Senate will not object to receive a statement from the Cabinet - a statement which explains and gives reasons for the policy which the Government intend to adopt? Surely the Senate will not object to me, as representing the present Ministry, reading a statement of that sort? The statement which I am desired to lay before honorable senators is as follows: -  An occasion of this kind would usually require some general statement from the new Administration charged with the leadership of the House; but in the present instance, in order to economize time, that can be very briefly summarized. This Ministry adheres to the practical policy sanctioned by the country at the last general election, and already submitted to this House, and exists for the purpose of giving effect to it. A majority of the members of the Cabinet are directly responsible for the programme submitted to Parliament in 1904, which was then accepted in almost every particular by our present colleagues, so that we represent to-day the same policy and the same party. The circumstances of our assumption of office prevent a formal submission of our programme in a speech from the Governor-General, but this is rendered comparatively immaterial, because the speech of His Excellency at the opening of this Parliament remains almost as completely applicable now as sixteen months ago, when it was delivered. To refresh the memories of honorable members, i will rapidly run through the programme then formulated, and now re-submitted. Taking the subjects mentioned in the order in which they appear in His Excellency's speech of March, 1904, honorable members will find - The taking over of the debts of the States (1), and compensation for transferred properties (2) mentioned in the third paragraph. The discussion on the first of these has been advanced a stage by the Hobart Conference, whilst the joint valuations for the second are now about to be commenced. As to the question of the transferred properties, I might inform honorable senators that I think we are in a fair way to arrive at some conclusion in regard to the amount of money we shall be required to pay in the form of interest at3½ per cent. on the value. Valuators have been appointed, and the whole matter taken in hand. In the matter of the taking over of the States debts, nothing practical was done at the Hobart Conference, since no agreement could be arrived at. The points of difference resolved: themselves into two. The States representatives unanimously desired that the provisions of the Braddon section of the Constitution should be made perpetual. The Commonwealth Treasurer at the time, Sir George Turner, said, ' No, but I am quite willing to agree that they shall be continued in operation for another twenty years, making thirty years in all from the date of the inauguration of the Commonwealth.' That was one point of difference. The other point was with respect to borrowing money in the local market. The representatives of the States desired that the whole of the borrowing in the local market should be confined to themselves, and they did not approve of the Commonwealth Government borrowing in that market. That suggestion was not agreed to by the representatives of the Commonwealth.

If the States Governments will agree to put a stop to them, they will relieve us of the necessity of going to considerable expense in the appointment of an Inter-State Commission, for such a 'Commission would be very expensive; and as the money would have to come out of their own pockets, they will be wise in the matter, we hope, and will take care to establish no preferential rates to which we can object.

(27) The Government is of opinion that the constitutional method, of determining the precise time at which the representation in the House of the people of the respective States shall be increased or diminished according to their numbers is by an Act of the Parliament. The dangers of leaving changes of this character in the hands of any Ministry, and of permitting them either to be set on foot at any moment merely by Executive Order, or to be delayed at Executive will, are obvious. Parliament itself should decide, subject to the Constitution, when and in what circumstances the representation shall be altered. A Bill to accomplish this will be introduced. Another important Bill will, it is hoped, effectually suppress what are known as Secret Commissions so far as they exist in the field of Commonwealth jurisdiction.

This list of subjects may be divided into two parts. The first is made up of minor Bills, aiming at useful but independent additions to the ordinary machinery of Government. The other consists of major Bills, embodying a progressive policy of development of the resources of the Commonwealth, intended to be carried out by systematic effort here and in the Mother Country, and, if necessary, in the sister dominions of the Empire. It may not be possible to complete this programme, though with the help of Parliament a great advance can be made before the next recess. The policy as a whole can be pushed far onward if we are able to follow a business-like session this year with a longer session next year, devoted to questions of the first magnitude, approached steadily and consistently from the practical side. At all events, so far as Ministers are concerned, this Parliament will be afforded, as it has itself demanded, another opportunity of fulfilling the purposes for which it was elected', and justifying the confidence of those who look to us to foster the national interests of Australia.

The constitution of the Senate is indeed the same as it was on a previous occasion, when I moved a similar motion and gave all the facts and figures relating to it. It was then agreed that a S elect Committee should be appointed. That committee was appointed, sat throughout last session, and took a large quantity of evidence, which was very valuable, not only from my own stand-point, but from the point of view of many others. It would be a hardship if the committee, which lapsed under the Standing Orders with the close of last session, were not reconstituted, and allowed to proceed with its inquiries so as to be able to report to the Senate on the evidence submitted. I do not think that it would take very long to complete the inquiry. Last session it took the evidence of officials of the Department of Trade and Customs, which was largely of a statistical character, as well as that of manufacturers and wholesale sellers of tobacco; but the evidence of the retailers in a smaller way of business and of the operatives yet remains to be received. The work of the committee was practically set aside under the standing order, by which all Select Committees cease their operations at the end of the session during which they are appointed. I do not anticipate any opposition to this motion, but should any objection be raised, I shall be in a position to reply. I would, however, urge the Senate to agree to the appointment of the committee, so that it may bring the inquiry to a conclusion. If the motion be passed, I shall move the further motion of which I have given notice, providing that the evidence taken before the Select Committee which sat during last session be laid on the table of the Senate, so that it may be referred to the newly appointed committee. I shall also ask the Senate to agree that the membership of the committee shall be the same as that which' took evidence last year, so that there may be really no break in the continuity of its thought and operations. I am sure honorable senators will agree that the question of the nationalization of the tobacco industry is not one whit less interesting than it was last session.
