In view of the visit of President Roosevelt to Central America in 1906, will the Government reconsider the question of tendering an invitation to the head of the American nation to visit Australia during the stay of the United States Fleet in Australian waters?

Subsequently, representations were made to the Government' by the Ammonia Company of Australia to the effect that they were about to produce immediately all the articles enumerated in this item. It was therefore resolved to make them dutiable at 15 per cent. The iron galvanizers of New South Wales then represented to the Government that muriate of ammonia was a necessity in their industry, and that that article was not being produced in the Commonwealth. Upon investigation, it was found that, although the Ammonia Company of Australia had not at that time started to produce muriate of ammonia, it was erecting its plant, and had already proved its bona fides by accepting orders for the supply of that article not only in Australia, but also abroad. These facts were brought before the House of Representatives, and a duty of 15 per cent, was agreed to upon the voices. A bond fide attempt upon a well established commercial scale is about to be made to produce muriate of ammonia, and 15 per cent, is, comparatively speaking, a very reasonable amount of protection to extend to the industry.

Those manufacturers have shown that they . have no faith in the coming company which is going to do wonderful things, but which can give them no quotation for muriate of ammonia.

I made no reference either to the first or second column, but submitted a request for the imposition of a single duty, as in the case of, perhaps, a majority of the items in the schedule. I need not occupy your attention in stating cases, because on nearly every page in the schedule items will be found to which single duties are attached. I submit that there was no obligation to suggest a duty on imports from the United Kingdom, under the proposed new paragraph. I submitted a request for a single duty, without limitation, and my request was agreed to. Having dealt with the proposed new paragraph', the Committee had finished with muriate of ammonia, and proceeded then to deal with the duties to be imposed on other chemicals. I submit that it is not competent for the Committee, having dealt with an article, and having not only considered but taken a division with respect to the duty, to be imposed on other articles, to go back and review a former decision. The Committee decided upon a duty of 5 per cent. on the proposed new paragraph, and a request was subsequently submitted, not to make the duty on imports from the United Kingdom, under the paragraph, 5 per cent., but to increase that duty by 200 per cent. That is only a side issue, I admit, but I mention it as indicating the extent to which it was proposed to vary the decision previously arrived at by the Committee to make the duty 5per cent., without any limitation. After that decision was arrived at, and the Committee subsequently considered and voted upon duties proposed in connexion with other articles, I submit that it was not competent for it to return to a matter which had been disposed of, and deal with a request intended to upset a previous decision bv the introduction' of a most novel proceeding.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[22]/interjection[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In the first place, a request by Senator Neild to leave out the word ' muriate,' and to insert a sub-item that muriate of ammonia should be free was negatived. Then he submitted a request to leave out the word, and to make the article, without regard to the columns', dutiable at 5 per cent. That request was carried, and it seems to me that the Committee then decided the rate of duty in respect of both columns, inasmuch as the request contained no qualifying words as to whether that was to be the general or preferential duty. I am not able to recall at the moment particular cases, but I remember that that course has been followed in regard to previous items. Another point, and a most important point, is that other business had intervened before Senator Findley submitted his request.

Another point has been raised with regard to a ruling given on the item affecting reciprocating engines. That, in the first instance, was a case on all fours with the. case we are dealing with now. It was determined to take reciprocating engines out of the item then under consideration. Senator Lynch desired to add certain words to the new paragraph after it had been determined to request the House of Representatives to insert it.

Nothing more was decided at that particular juncture except that muriate should be made the subject of a new paragraph, and a rate of duty was agreed upon. Afterwards the Committee went back to the original item, dealt with it, and completed it. When that had been done, a desire was expressed to go back to the paragraph dealing with muriate. I think there was no power to go back again. Muriate of ammonia having been taken out of the item as originally submitted, whatever was intended to be done with the new paragraph should have been done there and then. It was assumed that the new paragraph was completed by the fact that the Committee returned to the original item. There would be no finality about cur procedure if the Committee could deal with portion of an item as a new paragraph, dispose of that new paragraph, return to the item from which it was taken, and then return once more to the new paragraph taken out of the item. We should find ourselves in continual difficulties if that procedure were allowed. It was quite impossible to revert to the paragraph relating to muriate of ammonia with a view of making the duty 10 per cent, or making the paragraph free after a return had been made to the original item. I think that in this case the decision of the Temporary Chairman should not be accepted. I understand that there has been some misunderstanding in connexion with the matter, and it is just as well that the question was raised in order that it might be settled. It is far better that a question relating to our procedure should be determined than that misunderstandings should continue, because we are laying down precedents. Although a particular decision may inconvenience honorable senators, nevertheless, in this instance I think that the decision I am called upon to give is one the wisdom of which will appeal to honorable senators. I rule, therefore, that the decision of the Temporary Chairman cannot be upheld. Another question occurs to my mind, although I do not propose to give a ruling upon it at the present time. As far as the first column of the schedule is concerned-relating to duties under the general Tariff-it has been the invariable practice when a preference duty has been moved or agreed upon to make it lower than the duty under the general Tariff. That has been done to carry out what has been laid down as the meaning of the duties in the second column, namely, to give a preference to Great Britain. I do not desire now to offer an opinion on the point as to whether a duty in the preference column that was higher than a duty under the general Tariff would be in order or not. I merely put the point to honorable senators so that they may know what is running in my mind.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[22]/para[9]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

He assured us on the evidence quoted that it is impossible for local manufacturers to produce this Commodity and sell it in Australia because of the low price at which the imported article is sold. At the same time, he predicts that local manufacturers will be able to send their stuff out of Australia, pay freight on it, and compete in the open markets of the world with the same natural product from Germany. If they cannot compete here free of all freight how can they hope to compete in neutral markets after paying freight and charges? That is one of those contradictions that would at once strike anybody, but apparently it is regarded as one of the keystones of the protectionist arch. When the Tariff Commission sat there were plants in Australia capable of turning out five times the Australian requirements, and yet those plants are being multiplied. I will give the reason directly. Even when the Commission was sitting in Sydney, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company were erecting a plant-I believe a bigger one than that at Resch's brewery-because they saw that there was an opportunity of supplying the gas to certain consumers. But the fact that Australia now has plants capable of turning out five times the quantity required here, and that we are yet importing it, indicates something. The ordinary cordial maker does not buy from those manufacturers. He makes his own gas. But there are certain people in Australia who want the absolutely natural carbonic acid gas, which is not a manufacture, and which is obtained from Germany.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It is obvious, as Australia produces five times more than it wants, that no duty which can be imposed will of itself increase either the number of factories or the employment given. The best proof of that is the fact which I mentioned that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, with all those other plants in existence, ventured to put up a still larger plant. The statement that there are plants in Australia capable of producing five times the requirements of. Australia is not mine, but that of Mr. Resch, who asked for the duty. The reason for the present position is that it is cheaper for aerated water manufacturers to make the gas under their own roof than to buy from others.

The. amount of duty which should be imposed has been variously stated. With a fixed duty, the impost would vary according to the quality of the gas. When Mr. Resch was asked what duty he wanted, like Senator Findley, he said, 'As much as I can get.' I do not know whether there has been any conspiracy between Senator-Findley and Mr. Resch, whether the honorable senator was brought up in Mr. Resch's brewery, or Mr. Resch was educated in Senator Findley's school of thought, but they both appear to be possessed by the same idea, that a protectionist should demand the highest duty he can get. As to the number of men employed in the local manufacture of this, article, the evidence does not disclose that four men 'were so employed, but that ordinary brewery hands were taken off their work for an hour or two' at a time to produce the small quantity of this gas-which Mr. Resch required in his business. If it be said that the duty would lead to fourteen hands being employed in the industry, the answer is that some of that number must already be so employed, since the expansion of the business of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company must account for some. If Mr. Resch's statement is correct, the fourteen hands to whom he referred,, must be .already at work, and the imposition of the duty, without increasing the number of hands employed in the industry, will have the effect of increasing the price of the article.

As a consequence of the action taken in another place, I received a letter, on the 13th February, 1908, from the then Premier of Queensland, in which he pointed out that steps were then being taken to establish a very important and valuable industry, in connexion with which the production of carbide of calcium will take an important place. Honorable senators are probably aware that near Cairns, in North Queensland, there are excellent falls, known as the Barron Falls. So far, these falls have been put to no use, and have remained merely as an attraction to tourists. It has been suggested that the power of these falls might be utilized for some industrial purpose. For the production of carbide of calcium every one knows that a very cheap motive power is required. Not long ago, when there was a prospect of a duty being imposed on this article, the Queensland Government entered into negotiations with certain people in Sydney, and. this was the general basis of the developments which it was proposed should take place. Recognising that the Barron Falls were national property, and that it was in advisable that any private individual should control the use of any power to be generated by them, and also recognising-to borrow a word from a member of the Committee-the immense 'potentialities' of the falls for the generation of electric power, the State Government decided that they would not allow any private persons to actually harness the falls for private use.

Whilst the Government of Queensland is prepared 'to sell electricity to any one who chooses to establish works in the neighbourhood, that does not mean that it intends to deprive private enterprise of its right to share in the good things that are going. This company, which is being formed in Sydney, is to spend £25,000 in erecting works and taking the electricity from the Government supply for a period of forty-two years, at an annual payment of £12,000 or £14,000. Later on, when there was another turn in the political kaleidoscope, I wrote to Mr. Kidston in order to make sure of my ground. I received from him a further communication fully indorsing what had been said by his predecessor, Mr. Philp, who, when writing to me, said that it was Mr. Kidston who had made all the arrangements with the Sydney people. Mr. Philp told me that after full inquiry Mr. Kidston had every reason to believe that a thoroughly bona fide proposal was. afoot, and he hoped that the Senate would see its way to restore the duty on this article.I do not feel inclined to take up time in quoting a great deal on the subject. It has been gone into very thoroughly, and if any honorable senators should desire further information about the Barron Falls I would refer them to a report, published in 1906 for the State Government, on the utilization of the power of the Barron Falls, together with plans, by William Corin, who, I understand, is a Tasmanian engineer of very considerable repute. I shall be only too glad to hand a copy of the report to any honorable senator, and I dare say that another copy can be obtained in the Library. The decision of the House of Representatives to abandon the original duty was entirely due to the impression that in Australia there was no place where carbide of calcium could be made, or, at any rate, where it was likely to be made. I am not now going to move the request of which I just now gave notice. Senator Mulcahy has given me an intimation that he has a request to move, to which I am prepared to give precedence. Both requests, it is needless to say, aim in the one direction. Not only the industry of making carbide of calcium, but the development of other great industries in the North, where honorable senators are always trying to get white people to settle, might be encouraged if reasonable protection were given to this particular article.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[26]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It included a request to ask the other House to restore the duty of 10 per cent, on this item. I can therefore cordially support the remarks of Senator Chataway. In the other House it was considered that there was little justification for imposing a duty of 10 per cent. There was little information available as to the possibilities or, to quote the phrase of an honorable senator, the ' potentialities ' of the Commonwealth in this regard, and therefore it was decided that on and after the 4th December, 1907, the item should be free. Since that date the Common-wealth Government have received an intimation from the Queensland Government setting forth the arrangements which they were entering upon,-'and pointing out that by the action of the House of Representatives their prospects in connexion with the development of-electric power from the Barron Falls were seriously jeopardized. We were asked to reconsider the desirableness of imposing this duty of 10 per cent. I know, too, that as regards the production of high electric power' from natural forces such as waterfalls and rivers, Queensland does not stand alone in the Commonwealth, because there are such forces to be found in Tasmania, New South Wales, and possibly other States. In order to manufacture carbide of calcium it will be necessary to have available very high electric power, which may be only generated successfully, from a commercial point of view, for purposes such as these by harnessing those natural forces. I understand that carbide of calcium is made by the association of carbon with the metals to be found in chalk, limestone and such things, and in order to bring about that association and some decomposition or chemical change, it is necessary that high electric power shall be cheaply and easily available. The great bulk of the importations of carbide of calcium comes not from Great Britain, but from foreign countries, principally Sweden. Out of 85,975 cwts. imported in 1906, 64,005 cwts. came from Germany and 6,321 cwts. from Sweden. As a matter of fact, much of that which came from Germany came originally from Sweden. The total value of the importations was £64,601, averaging about 14s. or 15s. per cwt. We imported £22,089 worth of German origin and £26,706 worth of Swedish. Ten per cent, is a very small duty, and one that the Committee can reasonably request the other House to re-impose. In view of the great possibilities-in this regard, not only in Queensland but in other States, it is desirable that by means of a small measure of protection we would give an opportunity to those who-are desirous of embarking in the industry to take advantage of great natural forces wherever they exist. I-have had the benefit of an interview with Mr. Corin, whose report Senator Chataway has quoted from. For many years he was electrical engineer for Launceston and carried out very successful electrical installations there, where natural . forces were utilized for the generation of motive and lighting power.-From my conversation with him with regard to his report I learned that he is very strongly impressed with the great possibilities that lie before the Commonwealth with regard to the manufacture of carbide of calcium, particularly in relation, to the power that is contained in the Barron River Falls, and also with regard fo similar power that is to be obtained elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Senator Mulcahy has informed me of his intention to move a request to another place to impose a duty of-10 per cent, on certain terms and conditions-that' is as to a proclamation somewhat similar to the one approved last night with regard to locks and the one approved on a previous occasion with regard to certain oils. I hope that he will not submit that request, but that the Committee will ask the other House definitely and unconditionally to impose a duty of 10 per cent. The undertaking is an immense one, and I am given to understand that unless something in the nature of definite protection is assured it is not likely that the people will, on the chance of getting that protection hereafter, risk any capital in the venture.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[27]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I have made a somewhat deep study of this particular substance. I was one of the first to import from the Old Country a large plant for the generation of acetylene gas, and to give at Zeehan-for the first time in the Commonwealth, I think, on a commercial scale-a fairly large installation df a magnificent illuminating gas. I am very pleased to find that the Government of Queensland has launched upon a scheme similar to one which seven years ago I launched in Tasmania. The configuration of Tasmania enables' us to make use of our' water power. We have a series of plateaus, and some of our largest and most important lakes are immense natural reservoirs on the tops of mountains. Lake Sorrell is a great body of water at an altitude of 2,500 feet, and the Great Lake, consists of 40 square miles of water at an altitude of 3,500 feet. Tasmania is therefore a country adapted for the utilization of an enormous body of water for power purposes. When I was Minister there we provided a sum of money to make a scheme of this kind a success. Unfortunately Tasmania since then has not been quite so progressive as she was in my time,, and has not developed what I feel sure will be a very great asset to that country. However, the national asset remains. The water is there in immense volume, and at considerable altitude, and the geographical character of the country is such that we shall be able to use the immense power which we have. For the manufacture of carbide of calcium very cheap power is necessary, and not only that, but a very large amount of power. You cannot manufacture carbide of calcium safely with less than something like 2,000 horse-power, and that must be obtainable at the most economical cost. The use of acetylene gas has become very general throughout Australia. It is largely used in the country districts, and even in large towns the use of it has enabled householders to. free themselves from the monopoly of the gas companies. It is a great boon to be able to generate quite easily a powerful and pure illuminant, at about the same cost as one has to pay for the gas obtained from a company. I therefore think that it would be a mistake to impose an immediate duty. By doing so we should simply be imposing a heavy tax upon a large number of people who happen to be using this particular illuminant, whereas with regard to other illuminants we have already decided that there shall be no tax at all. I cannot see why those who use kerosene should be free from taxation whilst we Impose a duty upon carbide of calcium, which is used by numbers of other people. The statistics show that £64,000 worth was imported into the Commonwealth in 1906, and the importations last year were, I am sure, very largely in excess of that quantity. For the present year the importations will be still greater.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

He has reminded the Committee of what we have done in regard to kerosene, which is on very much the same footing as carbide of calcium, both being illuminants relied upon by the people in the more sparsely populated districts, who are unable to supply their wants less easily than townspeople ordinarily do. I ask honorable senators whether, after having decided that kerosene shall be free, there is any logic or equity or common sense in putting an impost upon carbide of calcium, which is used for the same purpose? The one industry is not entitled to any more consideration than the other. Both are illuminants for the homes of settlers, and both are to a large extent used by the poorer sections of the community. I see no more justification for putting on a duty for the benefit of persons who profess an intention to manufacture carbide of calcium than there was for imposing a duty on kerosene for the benefit of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. Indeed, if there were a choice between the two, I should be in favour of the duty on kerosene. The natural opportunities referred to by Senator Chataway are greater-though they may not be more picturesque-in the case of the production of kerosene from the bowels of the earth in the Blue Mountains than they are for the production of carbide of calcium at the Barron Falls. Further, the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is at all events a company which is in existence, and has command of a very large amount of capital, whereas in the other ease we have to do with a speculative affair in the hands of a company-monger, who is running about Sydney with a prospectus in his . hand. The Barron Falls have nothing to do with the matter at all. At the Barron Falls, as Senator Chataway informed me in reply to a question, sufficient power can be generated to supply, not merely the works required for the production of this article, but for many other industries. That being so, they will still be there for this and other industrial purposes whether we give Mr. Tyree the benefit of the duty that he asks for or not. I have no fault to find with what Mr. Tyree is doing. He has been in business for some time in Sydney, and is endeavouring to enlarge the industry which in a homely way he is carrying on to-day. Mr. Tyree, in putting his prospectus forward, did not say that the whole success depended on getting a bounty from Parliament. He showed that enormous profits could be 'made according to the figures which he put forward, and in regard to which he invited people to invest their money. But seeing that Parliament was evidently showering its blessings on all who liked to ask for them, it appeared to Mr. Tyree desirable to ask that all-obliging Parliament to give something which would be equal to another 10 per cent, upon the enormous profits which he had already promised to those who would subscriBe the capital of the projected company. If Mr. Tvree's prospectus was genuine, as I believe it was, and the company could carry on and return handsome dividends without a duty, what justification is there for giving him one now? Its sole effect would be to give additional profits to the man who assured those who wished to become shareholders that they would have profits enough without it. This matter has been before Parliament on two previous occasions. The item was introduced in the 1902 Tariff with a 20 per cent. duty. Another place at once made it free, as it did kerosene. Recently, when it was before another place again, the same course was taken, and for the same reason. If we are going to put a duty on this item, the kerosene item ought to be' recommitted, and there should be extended to the Commonwealth Oil Company the same consideration as the Committee is now asked to extend to Mr. Tvree's syndicate. The Commonwealth Oil Company has its retorts erected, its miles of railway down, and its mine tunnels and shafts already sunk, so that Australia is very much nearer to producing its own kerosene than to producing its own carbide of calcium by means-of the magnificent Barron Falls and by the agency of the at present paper-constructed company which undertakes to put the money in.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[29]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Senator Colonel NEILD (New South Wales) [3.50].-Certainly, the Barron Falls, when there is any water there, are an exceedingly grand spectacle; but, on the occasion of the only visit I made, there was not enough water going over to do very much more than turn a sewing machine. I thought of making an arrangement with the boots at the hotel at the top to let off half a dozen bottles of soda-water when I had got to a satisfactory position from which to see the full effect of the water power. I understand that one very fine sight is to see the coastal alligators climbing up the falls to browse on the cattle in the pasturages at the back. But 1 have not seen that. I have only heard of it, and so I do not like to speak positively. There are plenty of places in Australia besides the Barron Falls where water power can be got. I have seen a far finer rush of water in the immediate vicinity of the capital site of Dalgety. I have seen 80,000 horse-power, tearing through a gorgeless than a chain wide between fine granite Avails, where it would be possible to carry out any reservoir work or the fixing of any water-power machinery with the greatest of ease and the least expense. Water-power could be got there a great deal more advantageously than at the Barron Falls. Almost within the metropolitan area of Sydney, on the' Grose River, a considerable number of sites can be found for the generation of electric power, and there you would certainly be in a better position for getting the electric power in suitable positions for manufacturing purposes than at the Barron Falls at Cairns, which is in a somewhat out-of-the-way place as regards the great populace and great using-power of Australia. Again, in Tasmania, I do not know how many admirable sites there may not be in the vicinity of Launceston, so that I do not regard this particular affair at all as being moored closely onto the Barron Falls. I have read accounts of the Barron Falls in wet weather, when, I believe, they are one of the grandest sights, if not the grandest sight, in Australia. I happened to be there at an unlucky time, when there was barely enough water going over to supply the requirements of the Postmaster-General for a pleasant Sabbath afternoon discourse. I do not know what to say about this application for a 10 per cent., duty. I have had a letter from the good people interested in the Sydney syndicate, and there seem to be two or three difficulties in the way. We discussed one this morning on some other item, as to whether a certain firm would be able to make a particular chemical in Australia some time between now and the millennium. In this case we are double-banked with difficulties, because there is first the question whether the company is or will be in a position to carry out its excellent intentions, and secondly all the magnificent uncertainty of Queensland politics as to what some Government will do, while what Government is to be in power there for any length of time seems to be a matter of some little uncertainty. The position of parties in the Queensland Parliament does not make for prospective stability. The whole proposition appears to be contingent upon some Queensland Government carrying out the intention of constructing electrical works.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

How serious it would be then if all those who depend on it for their light in Australia found themselves in darkness! That is a very strong reason why we should impose such a duty as would make the production of carbide of calcium not only possible, but certain, in Australia. But I have serious doubts about the proposal because, when similar propositions in connexion with other items were under discussion, honorable senators declared that those who sought protection for certain industries could not give quotations of the prices that were to be charged. Has Senator Chataway any authority to fell the Committee what the price of the locally-made carbide of calcium will be if we impose a duty of 10, 15, or 20 per cent.? Have the company been able yet to quote prices? Have the Queensland Government indicated what they will charge for the electricity necessary to carry on the industry? Is there any indication of when there will be enough water in the Barron Falls? Senator Neild has cast serious doubts on the possibilities of those beautiful falls. They might be frozen. That would be a serious position, for the water would not' How, and the electricity could not be produced. In the case of another item we were told that the whole proposition was in the air, and that therefore no protection could be given.

Committee that of all the States Tasmania possesses by far the greatest facilities for the utilization of water power for the generation of motive power. I make this statement as a member of a company that some' years ago obtained a concession from the Tasmanian Government of water power to the extent of 75,000 horse-power from the Tasmanian river in the high plateau. I know that at the present time there is a company in prospect that proposes to make use of the water power to be derived from Tasmanian high lakes 2,500 feet above the level of the sea for the production of carbide of .calcium, without any Tariff protection or other encouragement from the public funds.. In the circumstances, why should we hand over public money to enable one or two wealthy syndicates to obtain a monopoly of the production of this article? It has been reported to me that the projected Tasmanian company would be able to produce far more carbide of calcium than would be required to meet the consumption in Australia for many years to come. The people concerned in the proposed' company have confidence in their enterprise, and do not ask for any public assistance. We should encourage that spirit, instead of giving public money to huge trusts.

I believe that at the Barron Falls there is plenty of power for the production of enough electricity not only to make carbide of calcium, but also to carry out other works. The company which wanted to get a lease of the Falls in 1897 had no idea of making carbide of calcium. They wanted to establish electriolic works in connexion with the production of copper in the back country. If the present company are able to generate the power* which is estimated by the Tasmanian engineer they will have enough not only to produce carbide of calcium, but also to carry on other works there to light the town of Cairns, and to carry on industries therein. I believe in imposing the duty on the article straight away. It is of no use to insert a proviso which would prevent such companies either in Queensland or elsewhere from raising the capital to establish works for the production of carbide of calcium. If they know their' exact position they will be able to obtain the necessary capital from the public for the purpose of starting the industry as soon as possible.

I am prepared to vote to make the article free, and if that be defeated to support Senator Mulcahy's proposal. Ten or twelve years ago I was approached by a gentleman who was very optimistic as to the value of this article, which he said could be manufactured in Australia. He brought what he said were facts before us, to show that it would be very profitable to use the waters of Launceston. I joined the company as a director. We then made inquiries as to the accuracy of the statements that had been submitted to us. We sent over an expert. But, after going into the question, we found that, whilst it was possible to manufacture carbide, it would cost at least £6 per ton more than the price of the imported article. Thereupon the company collapsed. That was twelve years ago. I have not heard a single statement to-day to show how the conclusion is arrived at that carbide can be manufactured in Australia at a price anything near that of the imported stuff. I earnestly protest against any action being taken that will tend to increase the price of carbide to those who are at present using it for illuminating purposes. Gas made from carbide of calcium is one of the most beautiful illuminants obtainable. It has been a perfect godsend to a large number of people who live in country districts, and who cannot obtain coal gas. To these people carbide is just as much a necessity as is kerosene to other persons. Before we impose a duty we should make sure that we are within measurable distance of carbide being manufactured in Australia at a reasonable price. When any honorable senator can show me that it can be manufactured locally at a price that will not increase the cost to the consumer, I shall be favorable to the payment of a reasonable bounty. This is an article to which a bounty might very well apply.

The reason why it is not being sold cheaper is that there is no local competition. If we were to impose a duty we should indicate to the world that we are going to make this stuff for ourselves. That would at once arouse the aggressive character of the importer, who would naturally say, ' I am going to keep the market that I have got.' and he would probably at once try to discourage local manufacture by reducing his price. I should not be surprised if we imposed a duty of 10 per cent. to find the price of imported carbide of calcium being reduced by 10 per cent.

The consumption of the gas in Tasmania is largely increasing. All over the island plants are being laid down not only by large but by small farmers. They find the gas as cheap as or cheaper than kerosene, have made their calculations, and obtained their plant, which cost a good deal in the beginning, upon the assumption that carbide of calcium would be free. To some extent, therefore, we are breaking faith with them in imposing a duty. Another gross inconsistency is that in several instances we have recognised it to be unfair to put upon the consumer a duty in respect of an article that is not being made in Australia, and provided that a duty may be imposed on an address being passed by both Houses to the effect that the industry is sufficiently established, but in this case the Committee have refused to adopt that course. I know a little about this matter because I was asked by a gentleman in the inner circle to make one to take up shares in the company to the extent of£1,000. I read the prospectus and other additional facts obtained from the promoters. The prospectus was glowing, but it did not allude to a duty. It asserted that the profits would be enormous, quoted the price at which the stuff was sold in England, Germany, and Sweden, and the price at which it could be delivered here. All the statements and figures showed that it could be made here and undersell the material from every other country, the shareholders making enormous profits. Therefore all the facts are against the imposition of the duty now proposed.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[40]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

To impose the duty now asked for will be to take a decidedly wrong course, in view of what we have done in the past. There is no question about the qualities of acetylene gas as an illuminant. It has proved itself to be even cheaper than electricity for lighting premises, large and small.

The Minister fears that if we allow saccharin to be imported at a duty of 15s. per lb. it will be likely to destroy the j£i 1,000,000 revenue of the Commonwealth or break down the great sugar industry of Queensland. Does the Minister really know the quantities imported in t906? The imports were about a ton and a half in weight, upon which duty was paid to the amount of £3,000. What then have we to fear from bringing down the duty from 30s. to 15s.? It has been stated that saccharin is-introduced into Australia primarily for those who through some affliction are unable to take sugar foods or whose death would be hastened by. the use of sugar. Why should we impose a duty of 30s. per lb. upon an article the market value of which is, roughly, about 7s. 6d. per lb.? Does any one suppose that saccharin is going to enter into competition with sugar while it costs 7s. 6d. per lb.? There is another property of sugar in addition to its food quality, and that is that it has a candying effect when used in some ways. This does not apply to saccharin. Another of the properties of sugar is that it has an absorbent power with regard to moisture which is not the case with saccharin. Is there any reasonable probability of saccharin coining into general use if we leave the duty at 15s. per lb.? On the other hand, a reduction of duty must affect the price by reducing it to those upon whom the hand of affliction is already sufficiently heavy.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[50]/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The term ' Voltoids ' is a trade mark, which has been registered by an English firm and simply indicates that the sal-ammoniac is put on the market in the form of compressed tablets by that firm, and the rate of duty which should be imposed is that which would be applicable to other lines in the Tariff. When it is used for such purposes, it may be regarded as muriate of ammonia, on which, owing to a misunderstanding on the part of Senator Gray, we have made a request that the duty shall be 5 per cent. I think that honorable senators will recognise that it is not desirable that, if a duty be imposed on an article in one portion of the Tariff, an identical article under another designation and in another form should come in either at a lower or higher duty or free.

It was said to be impossible to manufacture sal-ammoniac in this form in Australia, consequently there can be no competition with any local industry. A protest has been lodged with the Customs officials against the imposition of a duty on sal-ammoniac in voltoid form, but, in the opinion of the witness, the Department wrongly held that it is dutiable under Item 105 of the Tariff as medicine.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[59]/quote[1]/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The only man who ventured to approach the Commission at all pointed out that an anomaly existed. He stated that owing to the fact that two or three terms were applied to designate the same article of commerce some confusion had arisen, and asked that the whole of them should be treated alike, and placed on the free list. The A section, composed of staunch protectionists, gave effect to his request, so far as they could, by recommending that the articles should be made free. This afternoon one of the items came under consideration, and. in spite of the opportunity which Senator Neild furnished to the Committee to make it free, it was decided to retain the duty. Now we come to exactly the same article which under another name is free, and which the Minister proposes to make dutiable at the same rate. I recognise that it is desirable to bring the two items into line; but no reason has yet been shown why a duty should be imposed on this item. The correct course to pursue will be to recommit the other item, and remove the duty. I agree with the Minister that the two items should be treated alike-either made dutiable at the same rate or made free-but he might give a reason why any duty should be imposed. So far as I can gather from the A section's report, there was no suggestion that it was to be anything more than a revenue duty on an article which is not likely to be made here, but which is largely used in electric batteries, and the electric power employed in mines, and for other purposes as well as for galvanization. In view of the fact that it is not made here, it is absurd to impose a duty merely because we may have made a mistake in connexion with another item.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[59]/para[2]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

But a different complexion has been put on the whole question since it completed its investigations by the fact that in Sydney a company has commenced to lay down a plant for the manufacture of muriate of ammonia. If, since the Tariff Commission took evidence, or came to a conclusion two or three years ago, further information has made it clear that the articles can and will be made here if sufficient encouragement be given, that is quite sufficient to lead me to alter my opinion. I entirely agree with Senator Millen that, if muriate of ammonia is to be dutiable, voltoids of sal-ammoniac ought to be dutiable too, or if one is to be free the other should be free, because practically they are one and the same thing. The voltoids are really the same ingredient as the salammoniac, but made up into lozenges, one, two or three of which would be a charge for a certain-sized battery. The same thing can be done with the salammoniac in crystals. The article is put up in voltoids or lozenges for the convenience of some persons who otherwise might not be particular about the proper charging of their batteries. If muriate of ammonia, which can be used for the same purpose is to be manufactured here, then voltoids of sal-ammoniac ought to bear exactly the same duty. I shall do all I can to see that if one is dutiable or free, the other shall be treated in like manner, knowing from the evidence I have heard that the articles are exactly the same, although they may be put up in slightly different forms.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[60]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","326","KEATING, John","KPE","Tasmania","Protectionist","Minister of Home Affairs","9277","I moved, before the dinner hour, that this item, voltoids of sal-ammoniac, instead of appearing as free, should be made dutiable at 15 per cent. I pointed out that salammoniac also came in under the heading of muriate of ammonia, item 275, in respect of which we had a considerable amount of discussion this morning. Perhaps if I bring before honorable senators the form in which this Tariff appeared in the first instance, they will realize that this request which I have submitted is consequent upon an amendment made elsewhere. I said this morning, with regard to the item muriate of ammonia, that the Tariff in another place first appeared with a duty on carbonate of ammonia only. On representations received with regard to Australian manufactures, it was decided to add the words,' carbonate, anhydrous, liquid, muriate, and sulphate'; and in respect of all those forms of ammonia a duty of 15 per cent. was carried on the voices in another place. When the Tariff was introduced this item also, voltoids of sal-ammoniac, appeared in it; but having made muriate of ammonia dutiable at 15 per cent. under a previous item, as the House of Representatives did, salammoniac, generally speaking, should have been treated in the same manner. All forms of sal-ammoniac came under that heading, except voltoids, and paid duty at 15 per cent. There are manufacturers of tabloids of sal-ammoniac in Great Britain who have complained to the Commonwealth Government against what they consider an injustice in respect of the differential treatment accorded to voltoids. Voltoids, as I informed the Committee before dinner, is a name that has been registered as a trade mark or designation by a particular English firm; and although voltoids of sal-ammoniac are not essentially different from other forms of sal-ammoniac in tabloids, still that firm and they alone can use the name 'voltoids.' As voltoids of sal-ammoniac appear in the Tariff free, they are accorded more favorable treatment; than is accorded to other tabloids of sal-ammoniac But there is no more reason why they should be free than why other forms of sal-ammoniac should be free. Voltoids of sal-ammoniac should have been made dutiable at 15 per cent, consequent upon muriate of ammonia having a duty of 15 per cent. placed upon it. But the necessity for imposing such a duty was overlooked. As soon as the Tariff was introduced in the Senate, however, the Government gave notice of a request to impose a duty of 15 per cent. upon these voltoids. As the Tariff stands at present, one form of salammoniac is admitted to the Commonwealth duty free, whilst other forms of the same article pay 15 per cent. because they come in under the muriate of ammonia duty. There is no reason why there should be a distinction. I hope that honorable senators will see, therefore, that the request which I have submitted has not been moved with the object of springing upon the Committee anything that is out of keeping with' the general Tariff; nor am I asking the Committee to adopt any request that we may not reasonably ask the other House to agree to. As a matter of fact, the request will simply have the result of equalizing matters all round. Unfortunately, the necessity for such an alteration was not recognised when the matter was dealt with elsewhere. It was not recognised that the name voltoids was a purely privately-owned name. Senator Colonel NEILD (New South Wales) [7.51].-My honorable friend is a man for whom I have the strongest personal friendship, land he knows it. But really, when public duty comes across the path of personal friendship, I must do my duty; and the honorable senator's statement, while it was as clear as mud, was no more than a proof of his capacity for making explanations that have no meaning. My honorable friend has told us that he tabled this request. God knows how long ago! Why, then, did he before the dinner hour say that the request was moved to bring the item into line with a request that I had carried in the early part of the day? And if he wants to bring it into line, why, in the name of fortune, instead of proposing a duty of 15 per cent., does he not move a request for a duty of 5 per cent. , which was the amount determined upon in respect 'of muriate of ammonia? This sort of thing is ridiculous. We are getting too much of Ministers acting as a conduit-pipe for irresponsible junior officers of the Customs. Two lawyers cannot be expected to know anything about these things, and they give us the clearest proof that they know no more about them than they know about the domestic economy of the Grand High Panjandrum of the planet Mars!","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[61]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

That being so, it is certain that dumping is not what is troubling the local industry as has been suggested. Importers are cer.tainly not cutting down their prices in order io ruin the local manufacturer when they charge from 30 per-cent, to 40 per cent, more than is charged for the local article. I do not say that the local manufacturers are not turning out an article that is useful for certain purposes, but there are purposes for which the local article is not as suitable sis the imported article. Any one who 'knows anything of our inland industries must be aware that of late years great trouble has been caused by the appearance of a particular fly, and hundreds of men are now dipping sheep who had no need to do so a few years ago. It is to this fact that I attribute the increase in the imports to which Senator E. J. Russell has referred. The honorable senator shakes his head, but he was unable to give me any information detailing the imports of these various preparations, because in the Customs returns they are included under one head. I say that the large increase of imports under this head is due to the increasing practice of dipping sheep consequent upon the rapid spread of the obnoxious fly to which I have referred. I invite the Committee to say whether the health of the community and the cleanliness and perfect sanitation of our cities should be placed in the balance against a possible advantage to one or two men who are making these disinfectants locally. Senator Colonel NEILD (New South Wales) [8.21].-I recognise that Senator E. J. Russell is a good protectionist, and in this instance he is exhibiting himself as a good protector of vermin. It is quite clear, from the prices referred to by Senator Millen, that the locally-manufactured article is not effcacious, or it would not be crushed out of the market by an imported article for which 100 per cent, more is charged. People will not give 4s. 6d.-or 5s. for an imported article if they can obtain an equally good locally manufactured article for 2s. 6d. We do not want tons weight of nominal disinfectants that do not disinfect, but a few pounds' weight of an article that will be efficacious, not only in ridding households, shops, and factories of noxious insects and disease germs, but in destroying orchard pests, which people cultivating orangeries, orchards, and vineyards in every one of the States have to contend against. We know the trouble that these insect pests are giving in every State, and the stupendous efforts that are being made by the States authorities to cope with the difficulties they have created. If the imported article is worth so much more than the local article, it must surely be because manufacturers elsewhere, with their greater experience and larger output, are able to turn out a more potent destroyer of germ and insect life than are the local manufacturers of disinfectants. I do not see why we should permit the sheep-owner to obtain a sheep dip free of duty, and al the same time impose 'a duty upon the preparations required by the struggling orchardist, who has, in fighting the codlin moth, and heaven knows how many other insect pests, to work harder than the sheepowner.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[66]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

This matter is one which concerns the health of every household in the Commonwealth. Owing to our climatic conditions, we are in Australia peculiarly liable to the invasion of germ and insect pests, and' this item is therefore one which concerns not merely pastoralists and farmers, but every one in the community who has a home to live in. It concerns those who are suffering in their homes or in hospitals. We all know the various forms of sickness to. which human nature is liable, and how absolutely necessary are cleansing materials in. the shape of disinfectants and insecticides, not only for the recovery of the health of patients, but also to maintain a healthy atmosphere in the homes. When we remember that thousands of persons are suffering every day from some disease or other, that animal life has to bear many ills which are only curable by the use of insecticides, and that orchardists and pastoralists have to cope with fl;es and other pests, ought we to consider the mere question of a 15 per cent, duty as against the free importation of the articles which are best adapted to achieve the results which are desired by the unfortunate sufferers? We should rise above the mere consideration of collecting a few pounds in the form of a duty, and encourage, as far as we can, the importation of those articles which are considered' by many persons here as the most effective for coping with different diseases and for cleansing purposes. This question should be considered quite apart from the fiscal issue. It is far more conducive to the prosperity and development of Australia to maintain the health of our citizens and the cleanliness of our stocks and herds than to collect a miserable duty of 15 per cent, on insecticides. Surely the medical men and sanitary inspectors who recommend the use of specific insecticides are all men of experience, who know the virtues of the articles they recommend! Is it fair that those who are subjected to great anxiety and' expense in coping with sickness and disease should be called upon to pay an additional sum for the best article in .the market as against a locally-manufactured article, which mav or may not be good for the purpose? I ask Senator Trenwith, whom I have termed a grand old Tory protectionist, to rise superior to the narrow view that everything should be made in .Australia. I dc not doubt that in time good insecticides will be made here, and I hope that the day will soon arrive when people will be justified in using locally-made insecticides, but, until it does arrive, we should not place an additional handicap upon those who have to buy the articles recommended by competent authorities for cleansing the house or alleviating suffering in animals. In order to promote the commercial prosperity of this country, pastoralists, agriculturalists, and others should be afforded an opportunity to secure the best possible article at the least possible cost. The importation of the best article for cleansing-, and sanitary purposes will prove to be a far better investment to the Commonwealth than will the imposition of a small duty in order to develop the production of a> local article. I imagine that if Senator J.Russell or a friend of his were suffering from a disease, and the doctor declared that certain imported articles were necessary to put the house in a healthy condition, he would not hesitate to procure them rather than run the risk of getting cheaper locally-produced articles. It is most cruel and unjust to levy a tax upon the articles which medical men and sanitary inspectors recommend as essentials for coping with various diseases and pests. SenatorW. RUSSELL (South Australia) [8.39].-As I listened very attentively to the remarks of Senator Gray, I was reminded of a passage which I read a long time ago about a certain class of people speaking of those a far distance-off, and of the saying that, ' far back fowls have feathers fine.' I agree with him that in the United States and other countries there are some very clever and brainy people. So there are in England, and Scotland is not far behind. We are the sons of Englishmen and Scotchmen; we are of the same blood, and our brains are equal to theirs. We are all senators by the votes of the people; we are the elected as well as the selected. Senator Gray forgets that we in Australia are just as capable of making these articles and acting more honestly towards each other than are those who do not know us, are only out for making money, and do not care a straw about us. The honorable senator and his leader set the ball rolling in this respect. Fancy what Senator Millen would have said if I bad risen and spoken in favour of imposing a duty on sheep dip.

Senator Lynch made a very serious charge, to which I direct the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs. The honorable senator stated that three-fourths of the locally-manufactured articles were sold as imported articles. That is either a libel upon the manufacturers of Australia or an inaccurate and unjust statement. I do not believe that such a state of things exists. I believe that the manufacturers of Australia are above the perpetration of a fraud upon the public by labelling their manufactures as imported goods. If it is true that they do what Senator Lynch has stated, it only proves that buyers who know what they are buying realize that in some respects locally-manufactured articles are not equal to imported articles of the same kind. Senator Trenwith was absolutely incorrect in stating that I believe that no article can be made in Australia equal to the imported article. I believe that in a young country we have to a certain extent not only to borrow, but also to take lessons, from the great men of the United Kingdom and other countries until such time as we produce men who can in the different lines of manufacture produce articles equal to any which are manufactured abroad. I am as strong a believer in the future of Australia as is Senator Trenwith or any other person in the Chamber. I owe a great deal to this country. While I believe that my fiscal opinions are best adapted to promote the welfare and happiness of the Commonwealth, still I give credit to the honorable senator for holding the belief that his fiscal opinions are the best adapted to achieve that great object. We are each honest in our fiscal convictions, but to say that because I. hold a certain fiscal belief, therefore I do not credit Australia with the capacity to produce articles equal to imported articles, is to say that which is incorrect. So far as her experience and education go, I believe that Australia can compete with other countries in that regard. We, like all other countries, are copyists, and every day which passes over our heads makes us more and more so.

To compare the figures for 1906 with the figures for 1903 is somewhat unfair, because in the latter year Inter-State free-trade was only just beginning to be felt.

But if we compare 1906 with 1905 we find that the increase in the importations was only £900 worth. If the honorable senator will compare his figures with the increase in the sheep flocks where sheep dip is required, he probably will be able to account there alone for the increased importations. And these are clearly due to the fact that the local product is not supplying the demand. We have heard a great deal said about sheep washes. It is only fair that the Committee should realize that there is another very important article which is now going to be made dutiable at 25 per cent., and which might be left in the item with the sheep washes. I refer to the disinfectants used in connexion with cattle dips. We all know the ghastly results of the tick pest in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and New South Wales. The local Legislatures have made laws compelling the people-and these apply especially to the small dairyman and small holder-to use certain dipping apparatus. I ask Senator E. J. Russell, who, I am sure, is perfectly reasonable in the matter, whether he cannot see his way to include with sheep washes the materials which are used for cattle dips. Why should he propose to give to the sheep people special washes free, and say to the cattle people, who, after all, are the smaller men, because they include all the dairymen, that they shall pay duty on the materials which they use for cattle dips? A good deal has been said about the orchardist and the farmer in connexion with this proposal to impose a duty of 25 per cent. on insecticides. Is it not notorious that throughout Australia we, through Health Boards, are doing everything we possibly can to compel people to observe necessary sanitary conditions. We are compelling persons to use disinfectants everywhere. We are improving our sanitary laws from day to day. It will be remembered that when the Quarantine Bill was under consideration the Government was most enthusiastic in its desire to help the local authorities in maintaining sanitary conditions, and did not want to interfere with or check their operations. Yet here we find the Government apparently supporting a proposal to make householders and others pay 5s. in the £1 on all the disinfectants or insecticides which they may require. Is that reasonable or logical? I desire to know, sir, whether, after this request has been dealt with, it will be possible for me to submit a request in connexion with the materials for cattle dips?","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[75]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I am quite prepared to take the figures for 1904 instead of those for 1903, which I used. I spoke of the difficulty I had in not being able to give the detailed figures in each case. I am not able to supply those figures, nor is any other honorable senator. In reference to an argument that local men manufactured practically the whole of the items, including sheep-dip, I said that the increased importation did take place, and that it was quite reasonable to believe that we had a far better assumption than had our opponents. Certainly our assumption was very moderate when compared with that of my honorable friends on the other side. Both Senators Sayers and Chataway have talked about the tick and fruit pests, but neither of them ventured to assert that local disinfectants were not used for dipping cattle and dealing with fruit pests. Can either of them say that imported disinfectants were used for those purposes? I want to remove the assumption that my honorable friends on the other side are the only senators who happen to represent orchardists, market gardeners, and others. I assert that I represent three orchardists for every one represented by Senator Sayers, and I know their needs and requirements better than he can. There is no necessity for him to allude to my supposed want of knowledge on these matters, because I do not go about the country with my eyes closed. The orchardists of Victoria have been sufficiently patriotic to use the local article whenever they could. The pitiful appeal of Senator Gray reminded me somewhat of a little girl reciting a pathetic ballad about people dying in thousands. It is rather to be regretted that an elderly gentleman should address the Committee in that strain. He seemed to think that Australia would be overrun with vermin and disease if we did not import disinfectants.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[76]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

When the Tariff was introduced elsewhere, the item was dutiable at 5 per cent. (General Tariff) and free (United Kingdom). Representations were made when the item was being discussed in another place that the 5 per cent. duty would be of no practical benefit to British manufacturers. Acting on that belief, another place made the item free. Since then British manufacturers have indicated to the Government, through the Colonial Office, that the restoration of the 5 per cent. duty on imports under the general Tariff would be of immense advantage to them. I have not the figures for citric acid, but the imports of tartaric acid in 1906 were valued at, from the United Kingdom, £4,186 worth, and from foreign countries £33,038 worth, so that we imported eight times as much from foreign countries as from Great Britain. Of cream of tartar, we imported , £3,765 worth from the United Kingdom, and from all other countries £116,795 worth during the same period, or a proportion of over thirty to one. A duty of 5 per cent. upon goods from foreign countries, although small, may reasonably be regarded as having the possible effect of diverting from those foreign countries to the (United Kingdom a good portion of the trade which they already enjoy in those articles with Australia, and will not press hardly upon any one.
