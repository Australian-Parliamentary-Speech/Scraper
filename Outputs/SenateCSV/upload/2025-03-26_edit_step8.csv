"0","0","0","1","1","0","17","Senator THORPE","280304","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I, firstly, acknowledge that we stand on the unceded, sovereign lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, the custodians of this land, sea and sky country. This country has deep scars and memories of the massacres from the genocidal Frontier Wars. We feel it all around us. This building has deeply unsettling energy. It was built on a sacred gathering site, yet those who are in power here routinely consent to the continued violence against our mother country and our people and all those who want to protect and live by the law of the land. The Frontier Wars have never ended: same war, different weapons—same oppression of our people for access to our land and our resources for the profit of a few.  The 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody referred to the genocide convention, and the Bringing them home report released in May 1997 provides 689 pages of damning indictment of the genocidal policies used against First Peoples in this country, with a whole chapter on contemporary separations. The report found that the removal of First Peoples constituted genocide as defined in the convention, yet, each year, our children are still being snatched at record rates. Our people are still being dispossessed of our country, forced into homelessness and jails, on our own lands, at the highest rates in the world. We have discriminatory living conditions, life experiences and racism. All the while, our land and sacred sites continue to be pillaged. This is the continued genocide of our people, of my people. The lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who coined the concept of 'genocide' after the Second World War, literally used the massacres of First Peoples in Tasmania as a key example. As time goes on, more and more evidence of this country's dark, whitewashed history is being revealed. Just last month, the Guardian finished their eight-year-long collaboration project with the University of Newcastle called 'The killing times'. The report showed definitive proof that at least 10,657 people were murdered in at least 438 colonial frontier massacres. About half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government agents. Many others were committed by settlers acting with approval of the state. What is now called Victoria, alone recorded at least 50 frontier war massacres. My mob, Gunditjmara and Djab Wurrung, my grandmother's country, saw 70 Gunditjmara clans reduced down to seven. It is past time to let the truth be told and to stop denying genocide when it is clear before our eyes. It is time for everyone in this country to learn their local history and see what crimes took place where you live, where you sleep, where you work and where you go to school. Have a look at your own backyard, Aus. The late Kevin Gilbert, a Wiradjuri poet, artist and activist, told the story of his people's genocidal suffering in a poem called 'On the road to Queanbeyan', which is not too far from here: I look at the open fields and see the space where my people used to be I see the scars of wounded ground I cry as I hear the death call sound of curlew mourning by. The bill before us today, the Criminal Code Amendment (Genocide, Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes) Bill 2024, is about access to justice. It ensures that the crime of genocide is able to be prosecuted in domestic courts without political interference. This bill embodies a commitment to transparency and accountability and an adherence to international human rights obligations, including the genocide convention, which established a framework for states to prevent and punish acts of genocide or crimes against humanity. It mandates that all perpetrators, whether private individuals, public officials or political leaders, must be held accountable. Yet, when the Australian government ratified the genocide convention in 2002, they put in an extra sneaky, slimy provision that only the Attorney-General can bring a prosecution for genocide, that their decision cannot be challenged and that it cannot be applied to historical events. This means the Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, a single white man in this place, a political officer of the government, is the only person in the whole country who can make that decision, and no-one can question this. This goes against to the very intention of the convention. The Attorney-General is not required to follow any criteria for this decision-making, can make this decision in secret, and there is no possibility for judicial oversight, appeal or merits review. The Australia Tibet Council, in its submission, pointed out: In its application, the Attorney-General's fiat creates silence. The Tibetan experience has shown that silence only emboldens the perpetrators of human right abuses and genocide to continue their criminal policies with impunity. This bill contains two simple demands: to remove the Attorney-General as the sole person in this country who can decide whether the crime of genocide can be prosecuted in the courts of this country; and to lift the block on the appeal or review of these decisions. The main bill addresses atrocity crimes of genocide that occurred domestically, and the circulated amendment on sheet 3055 upholds the principle of universal jurisdiction and ensures the fiat is removed for crimes that occurred in a foreign country when the individual accused is neither an Australian citizen nor a resident. I want to thank everyone who made a submission to this inquiry and who provided evidence last year and I acknowledge the difficulty for you in talking about crimes against humanity and genocide of your people. We heard so many stories from experts and human rights groups but most importantly from First Peoples in this country, who spoke to the genocide taking place, as well as from many others, including those from Palestine, West Papua, Tibet, Xinjiang, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and many more. The inquiry made clear that the fiat stands in the way of justice and is an almost insurmountable obstacle for victims of atrocity crimes. Every single one of the witnesses, besides the Attorney-General's Department itself, supported the measures in the bill. Despite overwhelming support for this bill to pass, the committee ignored the voices of our people, disregarded the cries of those still living under the shadow of genocide and turned its back on the wisdom and pain shared by communities and experts, historians and survivors alike. They ignored legal and human rights experts. They ignored best evidence. This is to protect themselves. It is a protection racket. It's to protect their friends overseas and to keep lying about the history and reality. This bill was supposed to be voted on last November and to be witnessed by First Peoples and activists from across the country who travelled here for this purpose—my brothers and sisters, aunties and uncles from Palestine, Kanaky, Tibet, West Papua, and the Sikh community and of course our own elders, who have looked after their land and our communities for many thousands of years. Genocide survivors and their allies came from across this continent and from overseas to stand together and bear witness to whether this government would stand true to its supposed commitment to prevent and end genocide. Instead of seeing the bill come to a vote, I was censured and then suspended for calling out genocide and racism in this very place. I'm not alone in being punished. Over the past month, we have witnessed systemic, escalating attacks on cultural institutions, academics, artists, journalists and workers across the country for fighting against white supremacy, apartheid and genocide. Artists and academics have been censured, political dissent discredited and silenced, workers fired, and activists criminalised through a suite of legislation at both federal and state levels. The primary targets of these measures have been racialised communities speaking up against the realities of their own oppression. Today is another day in the colony, because we will no doubt see the Labor and the coalition parties double down on their domestic and international policies of genocide, genocidal denial and blatant disregard of human rights obligations. The fact that both major parties are unwilling to remove the power from a single politician who can make decisions in secret without scrutiny, transparency and accountability or appeal avenues shows that this country is complicit. We have seen in the year how, instead of standing up against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, Labor and the coalition would rather support their dear friends and allies like the United States and Israel. If you don't support this bill, you are complicit in the ongoing genocide of my people and people around the world, and, one day, you will all be held accountable because you've signed up to a convention. You are breaking the law. You are breaking international law, and each and every one of you who do not support this bill today will be personally held accountable and responsible and will be called to a court of law to answer—maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will come.

The coalition does not support the bill. Let me take the Senate through the reasons as to why. In technical terms, what the bill will do, if it was passed through the Senate, is remove what is a longstanding feature of our common law where the Attorney-General of Australia, as Australia's first law officer, must consent to the prosecution of certain serious crimes. These are crimes of the highest order, including genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. As I said, these are serious crimes.  As with other offences, the decision to initiate a prosecution for any such offence would, of course, be made independently either by the DPP or by a person seeking to commence a private prosecution. Given the serious nature of these crimes, almost invariably, however, these crimes raise important considerations relevant to Australia's national security, foreign relations and matters of international law that govern the actions of nation states. Therefore, legal proceedings in respect of these alleged offences may directly impact the interests of all Australians. It is therefore entirely appropriate that the executive government, through the Attorney-General, have the opportunity to consider the impact of any such prosecution on the national security and foreign relations interests of all Australians. That is what this bill seeks to remove.

As I said, put simply, the bill that we have before us—in other words, the legislation as drafted and the effect of the legislation, should it pass through this place—is, quite frankly, an attempt to further open up our courts to abuse by activists who engage in lawfare to pursue a political agenda.

We will not support a bill that puts the interests of all Australian citizens second to the interests of a narrow, sectional group of political supporters of Senator Thorpe and the Australian Greens. All this bill does is ensure that the courts are able to be used as a forum to make political points about events overseas or in Australia's past and make accusations about genocide or war crimes in order to advance nothing more and nothing less than a political narrative.  This immature—as we've seen on display today; the Hansard will reflect this—shouty, undergraduate and childish approach exploits and devalues what are extremely grave offences that relate to some of the most serious crimes imaginable. As I said, the crimes that we are referring to are genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, some of the most serious crimes imaginable. The legislation and statements made by Senator Thorpe in her address to the Senate and, more than that, her display during the speech that I gave yet again confirm that this bill is nothing more and nothing less than a vehicle for political activists to get into our court, to put the interests of the Australian people second to their own—nothing more and nothing less. Unfortunately, based on the last three years in this place, sadly, it is exactly what we've come to expect from the extreme radical Greens and their allies. Given this, literally, will be the last sitting day of the Senate of this parliament, I'll close my speech by saying this to all Australians: God help Australia if those radical left-wing ideologues are holding the Prime Minister's puppet strings in a Labor minority government after the election. God help Australia!

"0","0","0","1","1","0","33","Senator SHOEBRIDGE","169119","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Rarely do you see a political party step forward and say that it is in the interests of all Australians to have the law so skewed that politicians can decide whether or not somebody will be prosecuted for the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. Rarely do you see such a blatant exercise of self-interest from the two parties in this chamber as we just saw from Senator Cash, stepping forward and defending the situation.  Senator Cash said, 'God help us.' She as a potential future attorney-general would decide whether or not a prosecution could be issued against the Israeli Prime Minister, if he came to this country, and pretend that that would be an exercise of justice. We know her irreparable bias against the people of Palestine, the irreparable bias that the coalition has against the international court of criminal justice and the irreparable bias that the coalition has against international law holding decision-makers, like senior decision-makers in this government, to account for their crimes. Heaven help us if we get to that situation. The Greens support this legislation because, unlike the coalition and unlike Labor, we believe that Australians want perpetrators of genocide, of war crimes and of crimes against humanity to be held to account for their crimes, whether they occurred in this country or anywhere around the planet. And we don't believe that a politician should be able to veto those prosecutions. Indeed, it's offensive to the very concept of rule of law that a politician, using a political analysis, will let somebody who is potentially guilty of the worst crimes on our statute books, the worst crimes known to humanity, off for political considerations. The importance of this change is obvious right now. We've seen a genocide being carried out in Gaza, and that creates obligations under international law for our country to take action, for every country on the planet to take action. We have an obligation individually and Australia has an obligation collectively, under the genocide convention, to prevent genocide wherever it's occurring and to hold perpetrators to account at any time. We already know what the coalition would do if one of those people perpetrating the genocide was to come to Australia—they would refuse to permit Australian authorities to arrest or to issue a warrant, and would refuse to even allow a prosecution to get before the courts. You'd almost think there's a global ruling class who think that they should be able to protect their mates and protect other decision-makers who are making these kinds of brutal decisions to inflict war and violence at impossible scale against communities. You'd almost think they want to make sure they and their mates are never held to account. That's what this is. It's not about the national interest. It's about the interest of senior decision-makers in countries like this, the United States and the United Kingdom. It's about a club that's protecting the club and ensuring international law will never reach it and actually take out the powerful. If you want a classic example of how the club did that, we saw the way the UK failed to extradite Augusto Pinochet, a notorious war criminal, a notorious leader who oversaw mass murder and political torture. When Pinochet was held under house arrest, facing potential extradition to Spain to be prosecuted for those crimes against humanity, Margaret Thatcher, the coalition's poster child, sent him a bottle of scotch whisky and said, 'We support you, here's a British institution that will stand by you,' and issued Pinochet every political support, as did former US President George Bush. The club protects the club. They don't care about the genocide. They don't care about the war crimes. They don't care about the crimes against humanity, because protecting themselves is more important. Of course we support getting rid of a political veto before crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are prosecuted. The argument put by the coalition just then, the facile argument put by the coalition that this would allow unlimited activists to be running prosecutions, is either deliberately misleading or shows a degree of base ignorance of how the criminal law operates in this country. But either of those are a poor conclusion made by somebody who says that they want to be a future attorney-general of this country. If Senator Cash knew how the criminal law works, if Senator Cash had read any of the submissions that were put in for this bill—which you wouldn't think would be an unreasonable requirement before standing up and speaking against it. Senator Cash may, for example, have read the submission from the Australian Centre for International Justice. The Australian Centre for International Justice details the law in relation to the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth. I'll read: The Commonwealth Director Of Public Prosecutions … exercises discretion to institute prosecutions for offences against the Commonwealth in accordance with the CDPP … policy. The CDPP also reserves the right to decide whether to proceed with, take over or decline a private prosecution in accordance with the same policy. The spectre of unlimited private political prosecutions being run by the coalition is plainly false and legally ignorant. If at any time the CDPP thought that an inappropriate prosecution was being undertaken, they could take it over and shut it down, and historically they've done that on numerous occasions. But perhaps Senator Cash, who says she wants to be the future Attorney-General, doesn't understand that basic principle in criminal law. If so, that's an indictment on the coalition and an indictment on Senator Cash. So what is the rationale for the Attorney-General having the consent? We have an existing set of laws where, if there's evidence of a crime—and here some of the worst crimes: genocide against First Nations peoples in this country, genocide against peoples across the planet, crimes against humanity and war crimes—the AFP should be undertaking an investigation. If they gather the brief of evidence, it goes before the CDPP, who review the brief of evidence as to whether there's sufficient evidence to persuade a jury beyond reasonable doubt that it should go before the courts. That's how the law works for every other criminal offence on the books. But in relation to this—the most serious crimes—there's this political veto. Again, I go to the Australian Centre for International Justice, who explained the rationale for the Attorney-General's consent. They say that, while the explanatory memorandum for the bill that introduced this legislation originally did not detail why the Attorney-General's consent requirement was necessary for division 268 offences, 'the historical justification for such consent has been that certain prosecutions could potentially impact Australia's international relations or national security, necessitating government-to-government contact'. Additionally, the consent has been justified as a safeguard against inappropriate prosecutions. We know that last argument is specious because the CDPP has the power to take over and end. But, when it comes to the others, how is it in our national interest to let war criminals walk free? Can someone explain to the Australian public how it's in the national interest to let those who have committed genocide visit our country and walk free? Can someone explain how it's in our national interest to allow war criminals to wander freely around the planet without fear of prosecution? The Greens can't understand that, but apparently Labor and the coalition think there's an overwhelming national interest in letting those who commit genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity walk free and that somehow that will make a better world. Well, we fundamentally reject that proposition. We say not only that this act should be passed but also that history shows that Australia needs a specialised war crimes unit with the skills and expertise to respond quickly, build cases and hold war criminals to account. The sorry history in Australia of those for whom there was compelling evidence of war crimes being allowed to visit the country and then walk free, despite our having these laws on the statute books, is a sorry tale of the AFP and a sorry tale of deliberate government inaction. When Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa visited this country in 2011, there were attempts by the Tamil community to have a private prosecution brought, because the Sri Lankan president was deeply culpable in the decisions that led to the mass killings of Tamils in the final few months of the war in 2009. Political interference and a decision by the then Labor Attorney-General that they would not prosecute killed the prosecution. When Aung San Suu Kyi entered the country in 2018, there were requests to the then coalition Attorney-General for consent for a prosecution because of the crimes against the Rohingya community—crimes that have continued since at an appalling rate. They have the largest refugee population on the planet as a result of those crimes against the Rohingya people. In a press release, the then coalition attorney-general Christian Porter declined the prosecution, saying: Aung San Suu Kyi has complete immunity, including from being served with court documents because under customary international law, heads of state, heads of government and ministers of foreign affairs are immune from foreign criminal proceedings and are inviolable … That is directly contrary to our obligations under the convention, which expressly says that provisions providing immunity to heads of state shall not limit the reach of the law when it comes to genocide and crimes against humanity. In 2019, Jagath Jayasuriya, who was, at that point, a retired Sri Lankan general, had effectively directed the appalling genocidal attack on the Tamils in 2009. He was deeply complicit as a security force commander for operations in the Vanni region of Sri Lanka. Before he came here, people approached the AFP and said: 'You must begin investigations. This is a war criminal.' Repeated evidence was provided to the government of the day, to the then Attorney-General and to the AFP, and after months and months of urging, they did nothing. Jayasuriya was present in Australia between October and November 2019, but the AFP did nothing. Indeed, the AFP wrote back in September 2021, after failing to take action, and said it was because of 'an administrative oversight' that they didn't hold a war criminal to account. So we say this: of course we support this bill. War criminals, those who commit genocide and those who commit crimes against humanity must be held to account—whether those crimes happened here against First Nations peoples or anywhere on this planet. We commend Senator Thorpe for bringing in this bill and we reject the criticism of her passion and her commitment that we saw from the coalition. It's about time that the planet bent towards justice, and we can do a bit here by removing the bars to the prosecution of those who commit genocide and by making Australia live up to its international commitments. ","Criminal Code Amendment (Genocide, Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator SHOEBRIDGE (New South Wales) ","(09:27):","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","1","0","34","Senator COX","296215","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I rise to also speak on the private senators' bill introduced by Senator Thorpe, the Criminal Code Amendment (Genocide, Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes) Bill 2024, and to add—as my colleague Senator Shoebridge has already said—our strong support for the intentions of this bill. I also want to reject the assertions made by Senator Cash that this is somehow about political activism and only about political activism, and that we are somehow radical by believing that there needs to be justice for crimes against humanity and genocide and for war crimes. We see, time and time again in this chamber, the opposition and even sometimes the government come in here and talk tough about being the tough cop on the beat. How about being the tough cop on the beat when it comes to injustices in this country?  This bill, importantly, challenges the current power—as my colleague Senator Shoebridge has already said—of the Attorney-General, who is the highest lawmaker. I think Senator Cash's tilt, I'll call it, for her election platform to be Australia's next Attorney-General was to speak through the window to all Australians. But what I know in my home state of Western Australia, which is hers as well, is the Frontier Wars never stopped. The blood has never stopped being shed in our state. I'm a proud Western Australian and I know that Western Australians want to know the truth about the history of this country. As a proud First Nations woman, I think we need to ensure that giving power to the highest lawmaker in this country is not about one person and never about one person, because those crimes against humanity—such as genocide and war crimes—as Senator Shoebridge and also Senator Thorpe articulated, clearly need to sit above politics; they cannot be left to a single politician. There should be no political veto to bringing a criminal prosecution. So I reject that assertion that this will open up the courts to political activists across the country, because we live and walk this every single day. The lack of a proper legislative framework impacts on the most vulnerable people across the world. There is a plethora of evidence and research about war-torn countries that already shows this, including what we are seeing happen in real time in Palestine. We cannot turn away from that and we should not, just as we cannot and should not turn away from what's happening in our own Australian First Nations communities. At the end of the day, this bill is recognition of Australia's failure to fully implement the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide—from here on I'm going to refer to that as the 'convention'. Australia signed this convention on 11 December 1948. It entered into force in Australia in 1951. However, it was not enshrined in Australian domestic law until 2002, when the Criminal Code Act 1995 was amended to make it an offence to commit crimes punishable by the International Criminal Court. That meant that these crimes—namely, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, which are sometimes referred to as genocide and related atrocity crimes—became crimes under Australian law. In passing that amendment, the Australian government included provisions according to which proceedings concerning these crimes under the Criminal Code must not be commenced without the written consent of the Attorney-General and can not be applied to events that occurred prior to the commencement of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002, on 26 September 2002. This is commonly known as the Attorney-General's fiat. What we know and what history tells us is that these provisions undermine the very intent of the convention to prevent and punish the crime of genocide. The convention establishes that genocide, whether it's committed at a time of peace or in war, is a crime under international law. That's the important part of this. That's the importance that we cannot lose sight of. The convention states that all parties must take measures to prevent acts of genocide. Have we seen that happen? No, we haven't. We continue to see the failures of our own country in standing idle, watching what is happening and not challenging any of that. The convention also states this: … genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:  Killing members of the group;  Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;  Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;  Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;  Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. I can tell you that, in Australia, these things have happened, and still we see no justice. In other countries around the world, these things have happened, and still we see no justice. The colonial and Australian governments have committed all of these crimes. That is the harsh reality. These are the dark times of our past. It is the reason that Senator Shoebridge and I co-sponsored a bill to bring truth and justice, through a federal commission, here, and we will bring the bill in again in the 48th Parliament later this year for you all to vote on. These are uncomfortable conversations to have, but they are necessary to face the injustices that are happening. We cannot continue to go home, close the door and shut off the rest of the world and pretend it's not happening. It is our job in this place as political leaders to challenge that, and today, over on this side, we are supporting Senator Thorpe in bringing this bill to the nation's parliament to challenge that. We have an obligation under the convention to prevent genocide, and through the Select Committee on Measuring Outcomes for First Nations Communities and closing the gap, which I chair, we know that it is continuing to happen. How many of our children continue to be transferred into out-of-home care? When we said sorry in this place, that should have meant never again. In 2008, it meant that everyone should be standing on the right side of history, but it's continuing. The genocide continues. We cannot allow the necessary legal measures and processes to be determined by politics. We need to remove the political veto of bringing criminal prosecutions against these matters. We know that the majors in this place are terrified. We just saw one of them from the opposition stand in this place. They're terrified. For the first time in history we've got black women in this place who are standing up alongside our allies and challenging what has been happening for 200-plus years in this country. Everybody out there is listening and watching us and cheering for us, saying: 'This is great. We want to know about this.' Do you know why? It's because we didn't know this happened in our own country. We didn't get taught this at school. But also, if it's not in our household, in our community, we don't know what's happening and we don't know the impact that it's having. We will continue over here at the Australian Greens, as radical as you think we are, to call that out. Being passionate about humanity is not being radical. It is being real. It is showing empathy. That costs nothing in this country. It costs nothing. I wish that the political leaders on either side of this aisle would take some advice today and think deeply about what that means—what it means when you turn the television and the radio on every morning, when you listen to RN about what's happening around the world, but also in your backyard, and how you have the power to change that today by voting for this bill, to ensure that we all stand on the right side of history. This is the time for change. This is the last day of the 47th Parliament and this is the time when you can actually do that with your power.

That's what the community expects and that's what we're delivering. We will do this in a common-sense way that supports both national productivity and environmental protection. Everybody agrees that the current laws don't work. We said we would improve certainty for business. Certainty that helps drive investment in jobs, communities and nation-building projects. That is what we are doing. We said we want a country in which nature is being repaired and is regenerating rather than continuing to decline. That is what we are doing. This Bill would address a critical problem in our current laws. A problem that is playing out right now in a small community in Tasmania, that is supported by a well established industry. A problem that is putting jobs, investment and individual livelihoods at risk. This Bill would support the Government's commitment to provide certainty, clarity and fairness for ongoing industries, workers and communities affected by reconsideration of decisions under the EPBC Act. The Bill would remove the ability of the Minister for the Environment to reconsider a past decision on an action that meets certain criteria. Reconsideration powers have been available to the Minister since the beginning of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act a quarter of a century ago. These powers exist to enable the Minister to respond to a limited range of circumstances, based on new and changing environmental information. This is important. But, these powers can create considerable uncertainty and affect communities that have come to depend on a lifeline industry. The economic and social impacts of changing a decision can be severe, putting jobs, community and individual livelihoods at risk. Industries and communities like Macquarie Harbour. This is a timely example, but it's potentially not an isolated event. This means that swift action is required now, but also to ensure that these circumstances do not occur again. The Bill recognises that established and lawfully operating projects, where proponents did the right thing and referred their action to the Environment Minister, and which have been investing and operating for 5 or more years on the basis of that decision, should not be put at risk. The Bill would only capture a small subset of decisions that can be reconsidered called 'not a controlled action- particular manner' (or NCA-PM) decisions. These decisions are made when the Minister decides that an action does not require approval, because the action would be undertaken in the particular manner described. The Bill would also recognise the important role that states and territories play in managing environmental impacts, through their own plans, policies and laws. The amendment specifies that a project must have a state or territory management arrangement specified in its 'particular manners' to meet the criteria. The Australian Government is committed to working in partnership with industry, communities and states and territories to protect our environment and support the conservation and recovery of our threatened species. We have invested more than $500 million in targeted threatened species recovery, including under the Saving Native Species Program, the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Environmental Science Program. This is complemented by other Government investments for Ramsar wetlands, World Heritage properties and protected areas that support biodiversity conservation and the recovery of threatened species. We have invested $37.5 million in priority conservation actions for the Maugean skate population in Macquarie Harbour. Investments to improve water quality and environmental conditions within Macquarie Harbour and support critical species conservation actions including a successful captive breeding program. We are also actively working with salmon industry stakeholders on further steps that can be taken to protect the environment and ensure the industry has a sustainable and long term future producing high quality salmon. This Bill strikes a balance between the important task of protecting our environment, and the need to provide certainty and stability to businesses which have already made substantial investment to get a project up and running, and most importantly protecting jobs. This is good, sensible and balanced regulation. The proposed changes would commence the day after Royal Assent and would apply to any reconsideration decision made under section 78 after the amendment commences, regardless of how long ago the original decision was made. I commend the Bill to the Chamber.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","69","Senator DUNIAM","263418","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I have been looking forward to dealing with this issue for quite some time now, although one has to question what we are actually doing here, given it is well past the eleventh hour for this Senate to be dealing with something that could have, and should have, been dealt with a long time ago. What is this bill here for? It is a political fix the government have brought in as a result of a minister in their own cabinet refusing to do the job asked of her. That is what the government have been forced to do in order to resolve a situation that, as I say, could have been dealt with a long time before now.  The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025 amends the EPBC Act, a piece of law in this country that everyone in this chamber seems to agree is beyond fit for purpose—is broken. Indeed, it's interesting to note that they're words even the minister uttered earlier this week in debating this very legislation in the other place. We all agree the act needs reform. We all agree something should happen. In fact, the Australian Labor Party, now the government, promised us before the last election that they would reform this legislation in response to the Samuel review. They promised that they would fix this broken and outdated legislation. They haven't. They promised us we'd have new, fit-for-purpose laws that would be better for business and better for the environment. We don't have them. Instead, we've had a government mired in bureaucracy and led by bureaucracy in how it handles reforms to our critical national environmental approval laws. It has not progressed anything. No stakeholder anywhere on the spectrum is happy with the government's handling of any matter related to federal environmental approvals. From green groups right through to business lobby groups, everyone says the government have stuffed it royally. I think their record, the history of the last two years, very much speaks to that fact. Here we are perpetuating the problems with this legislation by doing another little patch-up job because the government have left us with no choice but to do this. When the green groups lodged the request for a reconsideration of salmon farms in Tasmania, which have been granted permits to operate since 2012—which was under the last Labor government, with the then environment minister, Tony Burke, granting those permits—it was our view that this decision should be made urgently to resolve this issue one way or the other. That is, indeed, what industry, as recently as the end of last week and over the weekend, were saying as well: 'Just get the government to do their job and make a decision relating to the permits, and the question that hangs above them, for salmon farming within Macquarie Harbour.' Would you believe, though, that for nearly 18 months this government has been sitting on this request from the Bob Brown Foundation, the taxpayer funded EDO and others? It has failed to make a decision. I find it astounding that this request for reconsideration is still a live question before the government. So, because the minister hasn't made a decision, hasn't done her job and hasn't assessed the evidence before her to the extent that she can make a decision, the government have been left with no choice but to legislate to work around this minister and end the uncertainty that has dogged this government. Who's running the show? The Prime Minister has said countless times he backs the salmon industry. He has been down in Tasmania telling salmon workers: 'I've got your back. Don't worry. I'm with you all the way.' But he's done nothing during his term in government until now. Let's not forget that this is a sitting week that we weren't supposed to have. But for the unfortunate events in South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales with Tropical Cyclone Alfred, which pushed back the election date, we wouldn't be here. So the government was left with no choice but to do this legislation. On 15 February, a letter was sent from the Prime Minister to the salmon industry. On that day, I wrote to the Prime Minister. We rang his office, and I said: 'We want to see this legislation. It is urgent. You have left this industry hanging for 18 months. You've promised us reforms to the laws, and you haven't delivered.' Do you think I got a reply to that letter? Well, no, I did not. We wrote again—no reply. We wrote to other ministers in the government. We rang their offices—nothing. There was nothing until the Monday of this week, when draft laws were offered to us, with a briefing, at short notice on Monday afternoon, about their political fix to an issue they could have resolved if this government were actually on top of its brief and doing its job properly. So here we are—this eleventh-hour fix to try and get an issue off the political agenda and make it not an election issue so that they can go down to the West Coast of Tasmania and say, 'We've fixed it; we've saved your jobs.' Well, why was it not done before now? I'll tell you why: because the minister did not want to. Indeed, as late as Monday, the minister still did not want to. The minister was not even slated to introduce the legislation in the other place, according to the information provided to us in a briefing. It was, indeed, the Prime Minister who was supposed to introduce this legislation. As it turns out, Minister Plibersek did introduce it, so something changed. I think they realised it was a pretty bad look to have someone other than the environment minister introducing legislation into the House to amend an act she administers—one she administers woefully. As stated, it took 18 months to get nowhere in the decision-making process relating to such a critical industry in Tasmania. In addressing the issue that she's now been forced to address, the minister—let's make no mistake about it—was not excited about this. She was not a fan of this legislation. She was certainly not the driving force behind it. But in addressing this legislation, as I alluded to before, the minister was able to concede that the laws are broken and are no longer fit for purpose and that this is an important issue that needs to be dealt with. Well, yes, by gum, it does, and it needed to be dealt with 18 months ago, as soon as these green groups got in the way and started doing what they did. But instead of acting when they could have and should have to end the uncertainty and allow salmon workers to have Christmas in peace, knowing that their jobs would be safe, the government have left it until now. If it was important, why on earth did we have to wait until a handful of weeks, if that, before the election? Perhaps the election will be called as soon as Friday this week, or perhaps Sunday. The reason was that they wanted to kill off this political issue. The coalition have called for this for 18 months and said multiple times, 'Let's recall parliament to deal with this issue, prior to all the big holidays, when families want to know their parents are going to have jobs afterwards and when people, including salmon workers, will be stressing about how they're going to pay their bills, including mortgage repayments and power bills.' We've said: 'Bring it on. We'll come back to parliament and fix it.' We've been doing that for 18 months. Instead, here we are, as I said, dealing with this political fix rather than having a proper decision made by the minister. We will support the legislation. There are amendments, which I'll come to in a moment, to ensure that this bill is as good as it possibly can be—noting that, as I said before, we were given this legislation on Monday. We had just a day or so to consider it, to understand whether it works; we hope it does. We are proposing amendments that will strengthen the legislation, and, of course, there will be second reading amendments that go to some of the other issues related to this government's poor administration of the environment portfolio and their blatant disregard for job-creating industries in regional Australia, be they salmon farming, forestry, mining or whatever else. We are committed to passing these laws through the parliament this week, although the appalling handling of this situation, and the political and cynical approach taken by this government in getting to this point, cannot go without remark. When we asked the officials at Senate estimates just a couple of weeks ago where the draft legislation was—more than 10 days after this letter had been issued and I'd responded to the Prime Minister saying, 'Give us the legislation'—we found that they hadn't even picked up the phone to the industry to convene a meeting to discuss the legislation. At Senate estimates they told me it was their 'intention' to have a meeting to discuss this. So urgent was this that it hadn't even been on their radar, even after the Prime Minister had dispatched this letter to industry! I think we can see this for what it is. What's more, this party—the Labor Party, the party in government at the moment, who are about to take us to an election—are very vexed on this issue. If anyone wanted to try to convince the Senate and the people of Australia that this is a settled matter inside their party room, they'd be kidding themselves. There is a very vast divergence between the opinions of some in the Australian Labor Party about how this issue should be sorted. There are some who are very uncomfortable with the idea of this legislation—and, of course, as you would assume, they come from the Left side of the party, and there are certain groupings within the Labor Party, such as the Labor Environment Action Network and others, who are not big fans of doing anything that would support primary and productive extractive industries in this country and having environmental laws that facilitate investment, create jobs and grow the economy while protecting the environment. We heard about the Labor Party caucus meeting that occurred earlier this week. It went longer than usual because, as has been put to the media, there was a quite heated debate about what the government was doing at this last minute—hoping it would hide, it would disappear under the cover of a budget with a few little tricks and treats in it for the people of Australia, it would sink without a trace. Well, of course, our friends from, I gather, the Bob Brown Foundation were certain to ensure yesterday that it didn't sink without a trace. And while I don't support their actions, it was rather a sight to behold: people gluing themselves to the steps and handrails of the Marble Foyer of Parliament House for their cause—again demonstrating the vexed nature of the political debate here, which has not escaped the Labor party room. They are just as split as are some others in the community. That's why, alarmingly, the Prime Minister, having gone over to Western Australia with his entire cabinet and told the mining industry of Western Australia—the backbone of our economy, the generator of royalty revenue for our country, which pays for schools, hospitals, roads, the NDIS and all sorts of other essential services—'Hey, mining industry, don't worry. We've got your back. We are going to ensure that this EPA never sees the light of day. There is no deal to be done. We will never ever allow this legislation to come in,' had to promise his party room that it's on its way back, as has been reported. A re-elected Albanese government, perhaps in partnership with the Australian Greens, if the pollsters are to be believed, will establish a new, giant green bureaucracy here in Canberra. Forget the fact that we already have seven EPAs across state and territory governments in this country. Why not have another one? But that was the sweetener for this bitter pill that they were going to have to swallow in supporting and waving through this legislative fix. We know the government was always going to do this. I have to revisit these heavily redacted documents that were the basis of a deal between the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party. When I asked for the details of the deal on these laws to establish a new EPA, they gave me these blacked-out documents; I'd love to know the detail of them. But that will have to wait until after the election because that is the basis of a Labor-Green deal, which is bad news for Western Australia and bad news for the mining industry. This EPA is going to be disastrous but it is now part of what has been agreed to in the Labor caucus to get this bill through today. We want to see a few changes here. There will be a second reading amendment, I can foreshadow, relating to the funding of the Environmental Defenders Office. Let's not forget this group was one of the instigators of the terrible situation Tasmanian salmon workers have found themselves in for the last 18 months. Why this government continue to fund that organisation to the tune of $2½ million every year, I do not know. It's the kind of thing that should stop, and that's one of the things we'll be calling on the government to do. We'd also love to see them rule out the establishment of a new green bureaucracy that will destroy jobs and erode economic confidence. More substantive amendments will be dealt with in the committee stage in this 11th-hour debate that we have no choice but to have because this government haven't done their job, as they should have. They will relate to the expansion of the projects that are caught in this relating to reconsideration requests from not just non-controlled actions but controlled actions; bringing the period of time under which an exemption would apply from five years down to 12 months; and the minister, instead of making her decision as soon as practically possible, making her decision within a 12-month period of a reconsideration being received—something we've well exceeded now. At the end of the day, we shouldn't be here but we are. We need to find a solution to this, and it has to be a permanent, lasting solution that supports these jobs in Tasmania while having an impact which sees the maugean skate survive. We want to make sure these laws do this. We are disappointed the government have been dragged kicking and screaming here; it's not like it's a new issue, which is why I am befuddled by the minister's comments that she is so surprised about the need to do this and her unwillingness to act in this area. We will move our amendments at the appropriate time, and I move my second reading amendment now: At the end of the motion, add ', but the Senate notes that:  on the eve of a federal election, the Albanese Government has been forced to work around their own Environment Minister in an attempt to fix a political mess of their own making, and that they should instead simply have ended the Environment Minister's disastrous review of the future of salmon farming at Macquarie Harbour;  the Government, and particularly the Environment Minister, must guarantee that they will not instigate other forms of legislation or regulations that will impose new controls or reviews on the salmon industry, including through the return of their Nature Positive legislation, federal Environment Protection Authority or use of other mechanisms in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, such as directed environmental audits;  the changes to the reconsiderations regime in the bill should be substantially strengthened to ensure that all assessments of all projects, across all industries, do not remain subject to the open-ended review processes that currently exist; and  the Government must immediately end the millions of dollars of taxpayer funding to the Environmental Defenders Office, which, amongst many of its other actions deliberately targeted at thwarting and stopping business activity, investment and job creation for Australians, was one of the three organisations that initiated the reconsideration request against the salmon industry'.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","70","Senator HANSON-YOUNG","I0U","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I rise to contribute to the discussion and debate on this piece of legislation, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025. It was introduced into the parliament only yesterday. It went through the House of Representatives yesterday afternoon, and it is now being rushed through this chamber today—no proper process, no proper scrutiny, no ability for the department or the minister's advisers to answer the right questions or to know exactly what the consequences will be of this particular piece of legislation. This is a stitch-up between the Labor government and Peter Dutton's Liberal Party to gut Australia's environment laws and to facilitate the continuation and expansion of an industry that is polluting the Macquarie Harbour and that is pushing the maugean skate, our wildlife, to the brink of extinction.  Yesterday, we asked the government why this legislation needed to be unprecedentedly rushed through the parliament, on the eve of the election. We heard from the representing minister that it was because there was a flaw in the environment laws. We asked what the flaw was. It was that the law, as it currently stands, allows for a reconsideration when the environment is being damaged—so the flaw is an inconvenience to the corporations. The flaw is an inconvenience to the industry who want to keep polluting, who want to keep destroying, who want to keep fishing the rotten salmon that is washing up on the beaches and the bays in Tasmania right now. The Prime Minister promised the salmon industry some two months ago that he would give the salmon industry a carve-out from Australia's environmental protection laws. That is why this piece of legislation is now being rushed through. Rather than listening to the science or listening to the local community, who are concerned and increasingly worried about the toxic nature of this corporate salmon farming in Tasmania and what it is doing to the environment, the Prime Minister decided that the 22 jobs—I'll say that again: the 22 jobs—in Macquarie Harbour are more important than keeping people's beaches clean and pristine and protecting the environment. This is all about rank, raw politics. This is about the Labor Party desperate to win Lyons at the federal election and desperate to hold on to votes. Meanwhile, they're missing the fact that the community in Tasmania are increasingly outraged at the sludge and the rotten fish that are washing up on the shores. This piece of legislation, which will now not go to a Senate inquiry—we will not hear from the experts and we won't understand the real legal implications of this—is a carve-out and an exemption for the salmon industry to deal with what the Prime Minister thought was a political problem, bowing to the pressure of the corporates rather than listening to the community. But, in the way this legislation has been drafted, there are unintended consequences that now give a free-for-all to corporations and industries across the board. This legislation opens the floodgates for companies that are trashing the environment to continue to trash the environment even when the environment is suffering immensely, even when our native species are facing extinction and even when science suggests that a particular activity is too damaging and should be stopped. What this legislation means is that, if approval has been given for a particular activity, whether it's fishing, mining or a land clearing project, after five years, if the environment is suffering terribly and we have wildlife on the brink of extinction, the minister cannot press the pause button and say: 'Hang on a minute. We might need to rethink this, because what we thought was going to happen is now worse. What we thought would be okay is now not.' The minister will not be able to look after the environment, because the interests of the corporations will have been embedded into the law. That's what this piece of legislation does. This is about protecting those industries from environmental scrutiny and from being held up to the requirements of environmental protection law, and it allows a free-for-all for environmental destruction. This law passing today, being rushed through by the Labor Party, will mean that Australia's environmental laws are weaker than they were when the Labor Party came to power. What does that say about the Albanese government and Minister Plibersek's legacy? Three years ago, when the Labor Party was elected to government, we heard promises from the environment minister that the environment was back, that this government would act on strengthening environmental protections, putting in place rules that would ensure we stop the extinction of our native species and that there would be accountability for the industries and corporations that have been doing the wrong thing. That was a promise. That promise was made to the Australian people at the last election and was reinforced once Labor came to power. The bill that is being rushed through the parliament today does the exact opposite. In fact, it doesn't just not deliver on that promise; it takes Australia backwards. It makes our environment laws weaker, more defunct, and less able to protect the environment and our native species than when the Prime Minister took office. The election will be called sometime in the next four or five days and Anthony Albanese will leave the office of Prime Minister asking the Australian people to re-elect him after he has trashed Australia's environment laws. The Prime Minister and the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, will walk out of this building tomorrow with weaker environment laws than were here when they took office. If you need any other reason to question the Labor Party's commitment to the environment, this is it. The Labor Party cannot be trusted to do the right thing by nature. This bill proves it. They are doing this because Peter Dutton asked them to. They are doing this because the salmon corporations, the foreign owned salmon corporations that take all their profits overseas, asked the Prime Minister to do this. The salmon corporations asked the Prime Minister to weaken the laws because it was inconvenient for them that the laws might actually protect the environment. They wanted a carve-out, they wanted a workaround, they wanted an exemption, and the Prime Minister handed it to them on a platter. This bill stinks as much as the rotten salmon that is washing up on the shores in Hobart and southern Tasmania. And, boy, I think the government has got this wrong, and I think the opposition has got this wrong. They are absolutely misreading the community outrage on this issue right now, and not just in Tasmania but across the rest of the country. Australians are looking for integrity in politics. They're looking for people and politicians who do what they say and say what they do. This bill is a rotten, stinking deal between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party to trash our environment and to weaken our laws rather than to do what was promised. The truth is that, if Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Labor Party cannot stand up to the pressure of an industry that has rotten fish washing up on its shores right now, there is no way in hell you could trust them to stand up to any other industry that wants a carve-out and a special exemption when it comes to the environment. If the Labor Party can't stand up to the foreign owned salmon corporations that are allowing rotten fish to wash up on the shores in Hobart, do you really think they're going to stand up to Gina Rinehart and the gas and the coal industry? Weak. Gutless. Pathetic. They cannot be trusted to do the right thing when the time requires. It's all about bowing to the corporate pressure, bowing to the donors, hushing up the community concern and silencing the environment. This industry has no social license left. Let's be clear here. Thousands of people are rallying in Tasmania because their beaches are polluted and are covered in rotten sludge, and the Prime Minister is backing the foreign corporation over the community. It's political suicide and it's madness, but it is at the cost of the environment. I listened to the Minister for the Environment and Water's speech in the House on this bill yesterday. The minister was so desperate to get off this topic while introducing this bill that she went through a litany of other things to try and remind the Australian people about what this government has done on the environment in this term of government. The list isn't very long; the list is pretty limp. This bill supercharges all of the weakness in the existing laws. This makes Australia's environment legislation and protection for the Australian environment weaker and more ineffective than ever under this government. This isn't slow progress. This is a huge step backwards for nature under the Labor Party at the behest of Peter Dutton. Let's not forget that Peter Dutton wants even less protection, and the Labor Party has now just delivered that on a platter of stinking, rotten salmon.

In my first speech to this parliament, I asked the people of Tasmania to take me at my word. Today, I want to recommit to the people of Tasmania that I will never give up on standing up for you. You can trust me and you can believe what I say to you. Today, I want to say to Linton, Salty, Tracy and your fellow workers; to Tash, Sammy and the other mothers in Strahan; and especially to young Logan and his schoolmates that I will stand up for you.  This debate is about several things. It's about good, well-paid jobs in Tasmania, which I have spent my working life standing up for. Most of you here have not worked on the factory floor in food production or in industries and processing plants that sustain whole communities. Let me tell you the same thing that I said 14 years ago in my first speech in this place: I will always stand on the side of workers, for workers' rights and for the protection of their jobs. This debate is also about community. It's about the aspirations of individuals and families to put down roots in a place that really means something to them. It's about safety and certainty and a place to call home. It's about the school that your kids attend, where you want them to focus on learning, not on worrying whether Mum and Dad will have jobs, whether their mate's mums and dads will have jobs or whether the school will close and their family will move on. It's also about the environment, and I won't apologise for having secured $37 million for environmental measures that support the health of Macquarie Harbour and the sustainability of the salmon industry, including funding for very successful oxygenation of the harbour; for a captive breeding program for the maugean skate, which is exceeding every expectation; and for better surveys and monitoring of harbour health. This investment is delivering real returns. For the first time in nearly a decade, scientists have recorded an increased presence of young maugean skate and found that the skate population is stabilising. The scientists at the University of Tasmania have told us that no further declines have been detected and, in fact, an abundance of trends are improving. There are no accidents in the investments the government has made in the health of the harbour and the future of the skate. Both industry and government have invested in science-led solutions. It's been deliberate and methodical, and our efforts are paying off. This legislation is a specific amendment to address a flaw in the EPBC Act. We're not going to stand by and see workers lose their jobs because of this broken law. The blame game which is singing out the industry and the communities whose livelihoods depend on the industry will not guide my actions, nor will it guide the actions of this Labor government.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","72","Senator COLBECK","00AOL","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","It's with some bemusement that I make a contribution to this debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025, given the debate that occurred in this chamber on a very similar piece of legislation that I introduced just a few weeks ago, where the Labor contribution was scornful, scathing and not supportive. Yet this piece of legislation that we're seeing introduced today is effectively the same legislation except it's been made retrospective, which is something that I didn't want to do as someone who has thought about the way we should consider this and what we should do in this place. There was an action in this place; I understand that. I don't agree with the action that the Minister for the Environment and Water took. She took the word of a number of discredited environmental groups through a letter rather than a formal submission and made a decision that she didn't need to make, creating uncertainty that didn't need to be created for communities.  Labor opposed that piece of legislation which didn't have retrospectivity in it. The three-year timeframe after an approval is five years under Labor's legislation, so it's longer. But what it doesn't do, and which my bill did, was provide the opportunity for a state minister to come to federal government and offer some consideration. That's disappeared. So, while I was trying to put in place something that was responsible, that considered the environment over a longer period of time and that wanted a good result which would provide some security to companies that had invested sometimes millions of dollars in the environmental approval, the government have wiped all of that away to solve a political problem that they created themselves. I find it, let's say, bemusing that during the last debate the Labor contribution was so scornful of what we were trying to do, which was to try to provide a balance between industry and environment which is important in what we do. We've heard a lot of very provocative debate and conversation here this morning about the very unfortunate circumstance in southern Tasmania where one of the businesses down there has been hit with a bacterial attack which they've struggled to get on top of. But the exaggeration about the impact of that, I have to say, is pretty breathtaking, and I've heard in recent contributions discussion about fish carcasses washing up on the beach all over Hobart and surrounding beaches that is simply not true. There are no fish carcasses washing up on the beach in Hobart. There have been a couple of circumstances where people, quite vigilantly, have found some pieces of salmon that have broken down, but there are not fish carcasses washing up all over the beaches around Hobart. That's simply not true. But that's what we hear in this debate: misinformation, misleading information. In fact, some of the images that are being circulated as fact, as part of this debate now, are actually AI generated. They're not true. Environmental groups are doing what they did in other recent cases where they have fabricated evidence: AI generated photographs to support their arguments. Yet this government continues to fund one of them, the Environmental Defenders Office, which had a multimillion-dollar fine imposed on them for their fabricated evidence to a court case. And here we have in Tasmania, right now, one of the organisations, the Bob Brown Foundation, again fabricating evidence. So we hear the Greens putting information forward in this debate that is simply false, creating concern for my communities and communities around Australia. I won't accuse the Greens of lying, because that is unparliamentary, but I won't give them credit for knowing what they're talking about. They're just spreading the bunkum that's been fed to them by these dishonest, discredited environmental groups that are funded by this government. We all express our concerns about the utilisation of AI, and here it is being used to create misrepresentations of the salmon industry in Tasmania. It's a disgrace. Then, of course, we have to listen to the xenophobic rhetoric about the businesses that are operating. Each of the three businesses in Tasmania started off as a family business. They grew their business. Yes, it grew over time, and they sold their business to larger companies, which provides additional capacity to invest and build an important industry for Tasmania, and it supports thousands of people working in the Tasmanian community. We want to see that continue sensibly, a sensible industry working with the environment. The suggestion that these companies are looking to, in some way, degrade the environment and do it deliberately, which is the inference being made, dishonestly, by some in this chamber but certainly in the environmental movement—clean water is important to fish farming. Clean water means healthy fish.

You completely misrepresent those circumstances in my state, based on fabricated evidence put together by environmental groups that have been discredited. It's dishonest information.  We, quite sensibly, have some amendments to this motion. We don't want to see the Environmental Defenders Office continue to be funded by this government. This discredited organisation has been found, through another case, to have provided misleading evidence, to have fabricated evidence, so that it could oppose a project. That's exactly the sort of thing they're doing in my home state right now. It's dishonest. I find it galling that the newspapers and the ABC run the AI, artificial intelligence, generated pictures in their news bulletins as a depiction of what's really happening when it's not. What happened to journalistic integrity? What happened to that? But with respect to an organisation like the ABC I don't expect anything different. It's an organisation that turned up to a lady's house to film a home invasion. So I don't expect much more from the ABC. We are debating a piece of legislation that we didn't need to debate, because the circumstances that created it shouldn't have been created in the first place. It was created by a minister who made a bad decision. The government tries to justify it by saying that they were required to by law, but they weren't required to by law. The minister had a choice to accept three letters—not three submissions; three letters—and reopen a more than 11-year-old decision or reject them, and she should have rejected them. That's what she could have done and should have done, and the salmon workers in Macquarie Harbour would not have experienced the uncertainty that they've experienced for the last two Christmases. We shouldn't be standing here at five minutes to an election to try and sort out a mess because this government can't do it itself or its minister refuses to. I have to say that I genuinely wonder about the longevity of this fix. Part of the deal that was done inside the Labor Party to get this legislation onto the floor of the parliament this week is to bring back the nature-positive laws that they supposedly put to bed and put away before the Western Australian election because the Western Australian Premier was so opposed to them. The Western Australian election is over and done with—'We don't have to worry about him anymore'—and they're going to bring back the nature-positive laws and a new bureaucracy here in Canberra. That's going to be fantastic for us all, isn't it? There's an EPA in every state and territory, except for one territory, and they're going to have another one here in Canberra now as well—more bureaucrats; fantastic! That's just what we all need. So what is the life of this fix that we're being asked to debate at five minutes before an election? Let's not forget, when we debated a similar bill just a few weeks ago in the last sitting fortnight, on every single occasion where the government had a choice, who they sided with. Let's not forget that every single industry that made a submission to the Senate inquiry into my private senator's bill—every single one, the users of the EPBC Act, those who spend millions of dollars to get an approval under the act—said that the private senator's bill would increase the security of their operations, which is what they wanted for their investment decisions and all of those other important elements of running a business. Who did the government side with? The government sided with the EDO, the Bob Brown Foundation and the political propagandists of the Greens, the Australia Institute. That's who the government sided with. So what's going to happen with a Labor-Greens government after this next election, if that's what happens, when 'nature positive' comes back and there's another bureaucracy in an EPA? What's going to happen then? Yet when you look at the circumstance of what's actually happening in Macquarie Harbour with the investment—admittedly, by the government, and I commend them for the investment that they've made, in that sense, but also by industry—there's one thing that's guaranteed the survival of the maugean skate, and that's the investment, particularly by industry. I go back to the point that I made before: the industry wants and needs clean water because it means healthy fish. They don't want to see the circumstance that they've been struck with right now, because an event like this is absolutely terrible for everybody. We see it disgracefully misrepresented, and we see the attacks on the industry take some absolutely shameful forms. We saw one of the activists who was here yesterday, Peter George, dropping an anti-salmon banner behind the Premier when he was commemorating the deaths of children at Hillcrest Primary School. This is a person who calls himself a leader of the community. What a disgraceful effort from that person. He wants to be a member of the parliament. He has no respect for the kids and families of Hillcrest. He's more interested in getting his issue up and using that very sad day for political purposes. This is what we're dealing with as a part of this debate. This is the sort of behaviour we're dealing with—fabricated evidence and misinformation, amplified by some in this chamber. Yet if you look at what's actually happening in Macquarie Harbour and read the science it shows (a) the conditions in the harbour are improving and (b) the captive breeding program has been highly successful, which is fantastic. So the existence of the salmon industry is actually providing for the survival of the maugean skate, which we must remember has disappeared out of Bathurst Harbour where there's no mining, there's no fish farming. So what happened in Bathurst Harbour, just down the coast a little bit further? Why don't the skate exist in that waterway? The existence in the salmon industry is one of the things that will guarantee the future of the maugean skate in Macquarie Harbour, because it's in industry's interest for it to be there. But of course there is no mention of the fact that there is a 120- or130-year mining history that impacts rivers flowing into Macquarie Harbour, or the fact that there are large empowerments further up that potentially impact on the oxygen inflows into the harbour. Protesters aren't talking about those things. The industry is doing something practical to ensure that the skate exists because they want their industry to exist. They've been there for 30 years, responsibly farming. They've had their moments, I'll admit. That has been turned around. We need to make sure that what we do ensures a sustainable future for a strong industry for Tasmania, one that I think is very important for our local communities.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","75","Senator DAVID POCOCK","256136","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I rise to speak in opposition to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025 and I foreshadow a second reading amendment circulated my name.  This is a bill that strips power from the environment minister. It guts oversight from the federal government. It undermines the very integrity of our national environmental laws, laws that are already weak and broken. And, to make matters worse, this bill is being rammed through the Senate without proper scrutiny, without consultation and without any serious attempt to weigh its consequences. Let's call this for what it is. This is an abuse of process, a carve-out for a polluting industry and a betrayal of the government's own promises to the Australian people. This chamber exists for a reason. It's not a rubber stamp; it's the house of review. It's a safeguard to ensure that our laws are scrutinised, challenged and improved before they become permanent, and yet here we are again being asked to wave through highly consequential legislation with no Senate committee inquiry, no expert hearings and no meaningful debate. The government has teamed up with the coalition to guillotine debate and force this bill through on the final day of the Senate. This is not how a functioning democracy should operate. This is how power protects itself. This is how vested interests get what they want while the public and the planet—our home—lose. Let's be very clear about this bill after some of the contributions we've heard. This bill is not about streamlining environmental decision-making; it's about shielding certain industries, especially the salmon farming industry in Macquarie Harbour, from proper scrutiny. Under current law, if new information emerges or if there is a change in circumstances any person can ask the minister to reconsider a previous decision. It's a vital safeguard, a check against outdated or inaccurate assumptions. It's a line of defence when threatened species are at risk. And this bill tears that line of defence down. If passed, the environment minister will be prevented from revisiting certain decisions, even if those decisions are actively harming our most precious environmental assets, even if they're driving a species to extinction, even if the original assumptions were clearly wrong—and the maugean skate, a prehistoric species living only in Macquarie Harbour, is a tragic case in point. The maugean skate has survived for some hundred million years. That's an amount of time that I think we struggle to get our heads around. The maugean skate has been around since the dinosaurs. It has adapted to one of the most unique marine environments on Earth. But it may not survive this decision to wind back environmental protections. Scientists tell us salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour is pushing this World Heritage animal to the brink of extinction. The RSPCA has now, finally, withdrawn its certification from Huon Aquaculture, one of the multinationals operating in Tasmania, citing mass fish deaths and animal welfare concerns. Yet, rather than step in to reassess the environmental approval—rather than pause and listen to the warnings of scientists, conservationists and community groups—the government is trying to remove the power to do so altogether. This bill would make it impossible for the federal government to step in and say: 'Stop. We need to reassess. This is doing irreversible harm.' This is legislation that prioritises profit over protection, that puts industry before integrity, that puts extinction on autopilot. For the young Australians who come through here, who would have seen pictures of the thylacine or maybe video of the last thylacine and thought, 'What ignorance, what insanity; what were people thinking back then, when they had government policy, when they had a bounty on a species like that?'—well, it's happening today, brought to you by the Labor Party and the coalition. I think this bill, on the last day of parliament in 2025, is very instructive as to where we currently sit when it comes to our democracy, the declining trust in the major parties, the disillusionment of many long-term Labor voters in what Labor actually stand for and the huge disparity between what they say they stand for, what they promise and what they actually deliver. You need look no further than our Prime Minister. In 2005, the year I finished high school, now Prime Minister Albanese introduced his own climate trigger legislation into the House of Representatives—great speech: it talks about the future, talks about how climate is the biggest issue we face and how we desperately need leadership on this and how we should be considering climate. In 2015, a decade later, he stood against the coalition's attempts to wind back our environmental laws. I think it's worth quoting him: The right of citizens with standing to challenge their governments in court is a fundamental pillar of a robust democracy. We must not set this principle aside simply to provide a drowning Prime Minister with a headline … Well, a decade later, here we are: the last day of parliament, and a prime minister desperate for a headline when it comes to salmon. Australians deserve better. We deserve better. The people and places across this incredible continent deserve better. The government tells us that this is a narrow amendment, that it applies to only one case. But that's not true. The language of this bill is extremely broad. That means we don't know how many projects it might cover. It could be salmon farms today and gas projects tomorrow, fracking in the NT or offshore drilling in sensitive marine zones. It opens the door to more carve outs, more loopholes and more legislative exemptions for industries that pollute, extract and destroy. That's the real danger here. Yes, the maugean skate is at risk, but it's about more than that. It's about creating a precedent that says some industries are above environmental law, that says some environmental harms are beyond federal concern, that says 'hands off' even when the damage is severe and irreversible. Worse, I've received independent advice from leading barristers chambers in Sydney that this bill does not even achieve the outcome it purports to seek. We have a bill that does not achieve the outcome it seeks and has potentially far-reaching consequences for our national environmental laws. No wonder there's a decline in trust in government. What are we doing here? The coalition are willing to just wave through legislation that may not even do what they want, because this isn't actually about that. This isn't about actual good governance; it's about some culture war that they want to fight. The disappointment I hear from people when it comes to environment and nature protection in this term of government is palpable. This government was elected on a promise to fix our national environmental laws. Labor then promised no new extinctions. They promised a stronger EPBC Act. They promised a federal EPA. They promised transparency, consultation and evidence based decision-making. What have we seen instead? Where are all those things? We've seen yet another captain's call by the Prime Minister to withdraw legislation that would have established a federal EPA and improved environmental enforcement; we've seen decisions to open up and extend coal and gas projects; and now we see a bill that makes it harder, not easier, to protect nature. This is not environmental reform. This is environmental regression. This is environmental vandalism. This is short-changing the future, and it flies in the face of everything this Labor government told the Australian public it stood for. You have to ask the question. There are many good people in the Labor Party. How do they roll over to a captain's call like this and accept a Prime Minister who says: 'You know what? Don't worry about the maugean skate. It can go. If you vote for that, we'll do what we promised everyone we would do three years ago. We'll take it to the election again, even though we had the numbers in the Senate to do it'? If you look at who stands to benefit from this legislation, none of the three major salmon-farming companies in Tasmania are Australian owned. Last financial year, they made a combined $7 billion in revenue. They didn't pay a cent of company tax—$7 billion in revenue, and zero company tax. At the same time, they're clearly just externalising all sorts of costs, from the inland waters to Macquarie Harbour to Hobart's drinking water and the impact that hatcheries are having upstream. These are multinational corporations exploiting Tasmanian waters and damaging a UNESCO World Heritage site. One of these companies is banned from fish farming in Washington state. Washington state says, 'You cannot be trusted, and you cannot do business in this state.' The founder of one of the other companies was jailed for bribery and corruption. But they get the red carpet from the Prime Minister. They're being handed an exemption from federal oversight, handing the environmental cost to local communities and future generations. The future of Tasmania is surely a sustainable aquaculture industry, ecotourism and a regenerative economy—industries with real long-term potential and minimal ecological harm. This isn't about the national interest; this is about vested interests, and it's shameful that both major parties are lining up to serve them. This bill is the latest in a disturbing pattern of this government working with the coalition to fast-track legislation, sideline scrutiny and avoid accountability. A month ago, it was electoral reform, pushed through without consultation. Before that, we saw the federal EPA shelved to appease the fossil fuel and mining industry lobbyists in WA. Now we see this legislation, introduced on budget day, in the final sitting week of parliament, with no committee scrutiny and no opportunity for community input—just a rush to the finish line, no matter the consequences. That's not how environmental law should be made. It's not how public trust is built; it's how it's broken. This chamber deserves better than to be treated as an inconvenience to executive power. The Australian people deserve better than a government that says one thing before an election and does the opposite after. Our environment, nature in Australia, the places and species that we love and that make this place unique deserve better than the legal carve-out that would send them into oblivion. This bill shouldn't pass, because once a species has gone it is gone forever. Once trust in environmental law is lost it's very hard to restore. Once we start letting governments change laws for the benefit of a single industry without scrutiny, without consultation and without accountability we are not just failing environment; we are failing our democracy. I oppose this bill and I urge other senators: think about what you are voting on this evening. Think about the future of this country. Think about a species that has been around for 100 million years and is unique to Macquarie Harbour. It is found nowhere else. You with your vote will very likely send it to extinction. It's a very different thing to have some skates being bred in a tank versus a species living in its habitat where it has been for 100 million years. We've got to start making better decisions as a country, as a Senate. Let's think longer term than this. This is the worst of politics—the absolute worst of politics. It stinks to high heaven. I hope when you vote you know what you are voting on, and if this thing does go extinct I hope it haunts you.

This is a shameful moment for this parliament, for this government and for senators in this chamber who will condemn the skate to extinction.  I've been raising the plight of the skate in this parliament, in this chamber, at question time, at every estimates. I initiated a Senate inquiry in 2015 into Macquarie Harbour, which, in the industry's own words, was a 'ticking time bomb' for the maugean skate. This is not something that has happened overnight—a quick political fix for the Albanese government; this issue has been bubbling away. There are a lot of good people in the environment movement and in the community who care deeply about this issue and have been campaigning to try and get the skate protected. For the life of me I can't understand why we are doing this when all the best science tells us that this skate is endangered, almost certainly critically endangered, when the uplisting process to 'critically endangered' is underway at the moment and when the evidence is unanimous. This bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025, means that, under federal law, this skate is on the path to extinction. That's the definition of 'endangered'. The science tells us that salmon farming is the cause of the skate's rapid decline, yet we are exempting the salmon industry from federal environmental laws. What gives? I'll talk about the politics of this in a second. But if, from listening to her, Senator Urquhart—who I have no doubt is going to become known as the 'senator for extinction' in this place—believes this is really about jobs, then I would say to the Senate that the government's own advice to the minister, their own briefing, said there were 20 jobs in Macquarie Harbour. Every job is important. There are 20 jobs, so I have a couple of questions for senators to consider before they vote for this: What's the price of the extinction of a species? Are 20 jobs worth us knowingly, actively driving a species to extinction? This is a serious moral question, and I don't ask it lightly. This is a clear-cut case. What we are about to do today, I've no doubt, will be looked at all around the world. I guarantee it. It has already been commented on in social media accounts all around the world today. It's going to resonate. If this is about protecting jobs at Macquarie Harbour, let me tell Senator Urquhart, the Prime Minister and all those in the Labor and Liberal parties: if you care about workers and jobs in the industry, the worst thing you could do is what you are doing right now. You are lighting a match under this issue. It is now on every TV screen around the country. Australians are starting to wonder whether they should be eating toxic Atlantic salmon from Tasmania. This is on the national agenda now, and it's not going to go away. This is going to spread like wildfire. The worst thing they have done is to bring this stupid, dangerous, immoral legislation before this chamber, before this parliament. If it's not about the workers, is it about the politics? Well, there's no doubt the Labor Party want to win the seat of Braddon. But, as Senator Lambie said in here yesterday, they need to get out more often and talk to people. This is not a popular issue in Braddon or anywhere else in Tasmania. The fact that the government would bring special legislation for their mates in the salmon industry into the parliament, as the last thing they do in the 47th Parliament, and the fact that they would give more than $40 million in handouts to foreign owned multinational companies who do not pay any tax suggest institutional corruption. This is the institution of parliament and big political parties in bed with big, multinational salmon companies. It is cronyism. By any definition, this is straight-up cronyism and institutional corruption. It is the Prime Minister and the Labor Party saying: 'We'll give you money and we'll pass special legislation for you so we can win a seat.' That doesn't pass the pub test. That is corruption, whichever way you look at it. You are pushing a species to extinction and you're prepared to say: 'We don't care about extinction. We believe that a few jobs in the salmon industry and protecting its profits is more important.' I would urge senators to look at the scientific advice of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. They have made very clear what threats there are to the skate and to the World Heritage values of Macquarie Harbour, which is now known internationally as a biodiversity hotspot that needs to be protected. I would ask you to look at the evidence, please, before you sign the death warrant for this creature that has been with us since the age of the dinosaurs. When I initiated a Senate inquiry into this issue 10 years ago, I had a manila folder put under my door with leaked emails from CEOs of Tasmania's salmon companies to the Premier at the time. They were saying: 'Regulate the industry. Do more to protect the skate, because, if you don't, this is going to blow up in everyone's face.' We had a Senate inquiry into that. Four Corners did an expose of it. That was 10 years ago, and the environment in Macquarie Harbour has only got worse because of climate change, extreme weather events and a lack of dissolved oxygen. The salmon companies are losing millions of fish in single upwellings, where the nitrogen load becomes so high and the oxygen levels become so low, because of the warming oceans and farming practices, that millions of fish are literally drowning in their own shit. That is what this is.

But you get the point—imagine dying that way.  As Senator Hanson-Young said in her contribution today, those fish are washing up on our beaches in Tasmania. They're polluting our waterways. Come down to Tasmania, the clean, green and clever state, but just don't go for a walk on the beach—you might tread on rotting salmon carcasses. This is the industry and the industrial activity in the pristine Macquarie Harbour—or it was pristine, before the salmon industry came in—this parliament wants to protect with special legislation. What happened after they leaked these dossiers to me and we had a Senate inquiry into this 10 years ago? The industry went to war. They took each other to court. Huon Aquaculture took Tassal and the Tasmanian government to court to try and improve practices in Macquarie Harbour. The industry themselves recognised this problem. This is not the Greens or green groups, which is the way Senator Duniam and others try to label this. The industry themselves went to war over this, and nothing has come of it. The salmon industry formed an association to speak on behalf of themselves. They've been bought out, now, by foreign owned multinational companies, and they have plans to expand—not on our watch. This legislation will, no doubt, pass today, because the Labor and Liberal parties don't care about the extinction of a species. They aren't prepared to listen to the science. But it's not going to stop here today. I haven't seen Australia's environment movement—and Senator McAllister is close to a lot of our environment groups in Australia, so she understands—so united on an issue as they are on this. I have never seen them so angry—and rightly so. After coming into this place year after year and fighting, lobbying and advocating for strong environment laws, what do they see? They see a government weaken environment laws for the salmon industry. You have done what many of us couldn't do—you, the Labor Party and the Prime Minister, have united Australia's environment movement behind this. Expect this to be an election issue, an issue after the election and an issue in a balance-of-power arrangement. This is not going to go away. This is one of the stupidest strategic political decisions I've ever seen. This is actually, for me personally, coming up to 13 years in this place, the lowest moment, to see two major political parties get together to protect a polluting industry that's about to push a species to extinction. You will get contacted by your constituents. There will be a lot more than 20 workers you'll be hearing from. You'll get contacted all around the country about this. You'll get international pressure from international agencies who care about the world heritage values of Macquarie Harbour. The damage that will be done to the salmon industry and its workers from this will far outweigh any economic damage to the salmon industry from withdrawing from Macquarie Harbour. I have a timeline here going back to when the salmon industry rapidly and aggressively expanded in Macquarie Harbour in 2012 without doing the required work. That was opposed by the Greens all those years ago in 2012. They have bulldozed all obstacles in their way, because of the cosy relationships they have as cronies with the Labor and Liberal parties at both state and federal levels. It stinks. The politics on this are as rotten as the stinking fish washing up on Tasmanian beaches, and Tasmanians and Australians can smell it. But that's enough of the politics; let's just look at the science. I heard the Prime Minister, at a press conference the other day, say that a new report has been released by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, at the University of Tasmania, saying that skate numbers are back to what they were in 2014, 11 years ago. Guess what? That is disputed. There is considerable uncertainty in the science. The most eminent scientists in this area have provided advice to the Threatened Species Scientific Committee that is different to that, and that's not to mention it was IMAS themselves that rang the bell on this, by saying this species is one extreme weather event away from extinction. That's what has triggered this whole process. That's the science. Even if the Prime Minister was right and the numbers are back to what they were in 2014—and I hope he's right; I genuinely do—it is still endangered. The number of skate left in the harbour before the 2022 report was believed to be 1,200, and it's the only place left on earth where this dinosaur lives. And it is actually a dinosaur. That's why Macquarie Harbour has World Heritage value; it's because of this skate. There are 1,200 skate left, so, if the Prime Minister is right, we are still talking about an endangered species on the brink of extinction. That is the definition of 'endangered' under federal environment law—on the path to extinction. So that is meaningless. He also talks about the money they have committed to oxygenation in Macquarie Harbour, turning a World Heritage harbour into a giant oxygenated fish tank. Well, guess what? Labor's own pilot study as to whether that will work doesn't finish till the end of this year, but they've already committed the money. How bloody cynical is that? And then he talks about the money they're putting into the captive breeding program. So there we go—we're going to have the maugean skate, one of the last dinosaurs left on this planet, in a bloody aquarium! These skates are fed a brew they don't get in the wild, and the females are laying eggs which hatch into baby skates, but they can't tell us whether the eggs had already been fertilised before the females came into captivity. This is what the Prime Minister has been saying to try and defend this toxic legislation that we have before us today. I was feeling pretty speechless this morning; I really was. I can't tell you how angry and disappointed I am, after all my time in this place, to see this in the last moments of this parliament. You guys are a bunch of cynical, mean—I've got to try and control myself here—heartless, mongrel bastards.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","84","Senator POLLEY","e5x","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025. This bill is very specific. It's a minor change with extremely strict criteria, focusing on giving Tasmanian workers certainty while government investments protect the maugean skate. As a Tasmanian, I know and understand how important this industry is to our economy, to the people who work in this sector and to the communities that support those workers. As a government, we have invested $37.5 million as a priority for maugean skate conservation actions, including successful captive breeding programs and expanding the oxidisation program in Macquarie Harbour.  I understand what's going on here and what's going on back in Tasmania with the Greens political party. They see this as an opportunity because their support base is fading away because they are too extreme on all the issues that they are trying to pursue. They need to actually raise their profiles again because Australian people understand how they have blocked investment in housing in this place purely for their own political reasons. They're not just environmentalists; these people are elected to the Senate, their party is a political party and they will take up whatever issue they believe will be to their advantage and become very political. It's all about social media grabs for them and trying to secure elected positions, which is what political parties do. That's what the Labor Party does and it's what the Liberal Party does. But they have no shame. They will put at risk Tasmanian jobs, our economy and our communities for their own political advantage. Everyone agrees that our nature laws need reform. We want to see laws which provide better environmental protections and faster decision-making, and we are very much still committed to achieving that. Unfortunately, the Liberals and the Nationals teamed up with the Greens political party here in the Senate to block our laws, including to establish an independent environmental protection agency. They come in here today shedding tears and being very dramatic, but, when they had the opportunity to support good legislation to protect the environment, what did they do? They teamed up with the Liberals and the Nationals. As I've said many times before in this place and outside it in my home state of Tasmania, I stand with those workers very proudly. I am proud of the Tasmanian aquaculture industry, particularly what's occurred and the opportunities that have been presented to young Tasmanians within the salmon industry across the state. Too often it's the minority, noisy protesters that seem to get the ear of the government. This time, our government, the Albanese Labor government, has actually brought forward legislation to give security to those communities. Macquarie Harbour is at the centre of this, but it's not just about Macquarie Harbour; it's about the attack on businesses and retail outlets and protesting outside them for selling Tasmanian salmon. If that is not undermining the Tasmanian economy and the opportunity to expand and have more jobs, I really don't know what it is. I've spoken to many families when they've been here in Canberra and back home in Tasmania, and I understand how important this industry is to regional areas of Tasmania where there are some good job opportunities within this industry. From the outset and over the course of this debate around salmon farming and the skates, the Albanese government has always been committed to balancing economic prosperity, environmental sustainability and community wellbeing, and we stand by that today and every day. The salmon industry is an important part of Tasmania's economy. As I said, it supports regional jobs, businesses and families and is a big part of so many people's way of life. If we don't have those jobs in regional Tasmania, we lose those communities. Businesses won't open. There are those who try and trumpet that they're small-business supporters, but the reality is that they're not, because they attack small businesses, rallying outside and preventing people from going into those very important small businesses because they are selling salmon grown in Tasmania. I had the good fortune to travel to Norway in December last year and meet with people from the salmon industry there. We are, in fact, world leaders; they acknowledged that. We know that they've been the world leaders in the production of salmon for a very long time, and now even they concede the quality and the environmental protections that we have for the salmon industry in Tasmania. I'm very proud of our government for standing up for these communities and taking the challenge of the Greens. But what I really don't accept is the misinformation, the manipulation of photos, and going out into the media and scaring people about the dead fish that are washing up on the beaches. It's just nonsense. These are the extremes that they will go to to get a political opportunity that is all about their own political interests. When we're talking about scientific evidence, it doesn't matter that scientists will put a position that is supportive because of the evidence that they have gathered to support the industry. The Greens will never accept it. It won't matter what you do; the Greens will never accept salmon farming in Tasmania or anywhere else. As a Tasmanian, I—probably more than most—have seen, over decades, the environmental issues that the Greens have used to their own advantage. They start off here and then they want to go all the way. They wanted to stop logging in Tasmania. Then they were all for tree farming; now they're against that. What they say to people in the community should in fact be the truth. This government has recognised that there needs to be a small amendment to allow this legislation to go through and give certainty and security to that industry. Have they made mistakes? Yes, of course they have made mistakes. But they have also acknowledged that and learnt from it. We have always stated that transparency and compliance are non-negotiable, and any company operating in Tasmania must meet strict legal and ethical standards. They also need a social licence, and I can tell you that, when you go down to the West Coast of Tasmania, you will find that that industry has the support of that community. Obviously, if there's any evidence of misconduct or breaches of the regulations, that should go to the appropriate authority. Our approach as a government has been to work collaboratively with the workers, businesses and communities to ensure economic resilience and long-term sustainability of the salmon industry in Macquarie Harbour and across Tasmania. I have difficulty with any suggestions that decisions regarding the salmon industry, or in fact any industry, are influenced by politics, because we have always stood up for workers. It's in our DNA. We stand up for workers every single day, and I will never apologise for standing up for the salmon industry workers. It's also impacting on their families, as I said, and their communities. We base our policy decisions on expert advice, and we need to balance that with environmental, economic and social considerations. The integrity of governance is paramount, and any claims of unethical influence should be substantiated through the proper channels. It's time to put facts on the table in this debate. Aquaculture now provides more than 50 per cent of Australia's seafood and is acknowledged around the world as being the fastest-growing food sector, with global production expected to double by 2030. But ensuring that Tasmania's industries operate sustainably while protecting our world-class environment is a responsibility that we as government members and the government as a whole take very, very seriously. Even if the Greens say differently, that doesn't mean it's right. People have to make their decisions based on fact and expert advice, and a government has to take responsibility for the legislation that it puts through this place. We will be judged by that. But the hysteria, misinformation and untruth that have been spread around this debate are just typical of the Greens political party. As I said, the Greens will always use the opportunity to politicise an issue when they believe it is in their best interests to do so, even when it comes to people not being able to have a home. They refused to support us and they actually teamed up with the Liberals and the Nationals. For a whole week we were in this chamber ready to actually vote on legislation that was going to inject billions of dollars into the housing industry through affordable and social housing, and what did the Greens do? They voted to stop us having a vote. That's how they use politics. They're not as pure as they would like to convince the community they are. They are a political party that will seize every opportunity. But, if we're going to have a genuine debate about the future of any industry, we should expect nothing less than the truth being told and not misinformation. It will always be fundamental to our government that we make those decisions in the interests of the Tasmanian community. Of course, I would have liked to see this legislation come before the parliament earlier, but we also have to act within current legislation. When we're talking about how important this is to the Tasmanian economy, let me remind people that the annual total gross catch is worth over $1 billion and the total processed and packed value is almost $1.5 billion. We're talking about a huge contribution to the Australian economy and the Tasmanian economy. Further to this, Tasmania really is the food bowl of the nation, with more than 90 per cent of seafood products sold domestically and the possibility for greater export opportunities with favourable trading partners. According to industry, at the current rates, salmon production is expected to grow to be worth more than $1 billion. It will grow and it will continue to grow. With that responsibility and this licence that they are going to be given with the passing of this legislation, they know that the community and governments, including the state government, will be watching and ensuring that they remain good corporate citizens. At the end of the day, it's not always easy for a government to balance the responsibility of protecting the environment and people's jobs. I am very proud to be part of this government, which has actually listened, has visited and has learnt. Now we are able to give that certainty to those workers and their families and those communities. This is the right decision, and I urge people in this chamber to support this legislation. It is important not just for the Tasmanian community but for the Australian community as well.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","85","Senator DAVEY","281697","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Let's make no mistake as to why we're here today debating this bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025. It is because the coalition has led on this issue. For the last almost 18 months, the coalition has been leading the way to support the salmon industry in Tasmania and in fact right across Australia. Labor has been brought kicking and screaming to the realisation that something needs to be done to protect the salmon industry. But, even in trying to do something right by the salmon industry, they're not getting it right. They can't do it. They can't bring themselves to do it. What Labor is trying to do with this bill today is to win votes, not to support an industry that is vital and crucial for the Tasmanian economy. The Prime Minister is about saving his own job, not about saving the Tasmanian salmon industry—and, let's face it, this bill is certainly not about saving the job of the Minister for the Environment and Water, Tanya Plibersek. This is just the last round in a long-running stoush between the Prime Minister and his environment minister and, to a wider extent, the clearly divided views within the Labor Party itself on environmental policy. This legislation is about factional games. It's about dealing with internal warfare, and it's about political fixes inside the Labor Party—a party absolutely desperate to cling to government at any cost.  The salmon industry in Tasmania has been dragged through green tape, red tape and sheer obfuscation by this government, and, at the heart of it, it is the workers who have been living with the uncertainty. It is the workers who have had concerns about their future and the future of the industry that they love and that they are rightly proud of, and it is about the future of those workers who secure such an important economic industry for Tasmania that is—let's face it—enjoyed by all Australians. Who doesn't love a good Aussie smoked salmon blini? The environment minister has been sitting on this review for 15 months. The industry has been living with that uncertainty for those 15 months. Let's go back to why this review started. The Bob Brown Foundation, those doyens of consistency who are so consistent in their environmental beliefs that a wind farm on the mainland is fine but a wind farm in Tasmania is absolutely sacrilegious and cannot go ahead; the Australia Institute, the institute of balanced research; and then, of course, the Albanese-government-funded Environmental Defenders Office, the organisation that happily takes government money so that they can sue the government—they're the people who instigated the review of the salmon industry in Tasmania, an industry that has operated for years under environmental approvals. This industry has now been sitting with 15 months of uncertainty from a minister who has form for listening to the wrong people and choosing the wrong pathway, pathways that impact negatively not only the environment but communities and regional economies. Look at the track record of this minister. She chose to listen to an Indigenous group that's not registered, not legislated and not formally recognised even by their own land councils on a very questionable submission about a very pretty native bee and put the kibosh on the Blayney gold mine, the McPhillamys gold mine. That's one example of this minister listening to the wrong group. We've seen the ongoing, dragged-out, start-again, stop-again—will we, won't we?—nature-positive legislation that was listed and then not listed and pulled. We've seen the Prime Minister withdraw the legislation from the Notice Paper, the environment minister put it back, and then it was withdrawn again. Don't even get me started on this minister and how she listened to the views of environment groups over and above communities, industries, local government and even two of her state government minister colleagues to pursue water buybacks over and above supporting industry. My question to the Prime Minister is: if you can do it for the salmon industry, why can't you do it for the irrigation industry too? Protect the irrigation industry. This government is spending millions of dollars to rip water away from and to undermine the irrigation industry. This bill that we are debating today doesn't even provide the salmon industry with the certainty they need or want. It doesn't prevent a future request for a review. It only gives them enough certainty to get from this side of the election to the other side of the election—and we've seen that from this government before. We've seen the Prime Minister say whatever it takes to win votes. He says, 'We won't touch your superannuation'—until he gets elected, and then he brings in a retrospective tax on unrealised gains for superannuation. He says, 'We won't touch your franking credits' on one side of the election, and then on the other side he makes those tweaks. He says, 'We will support the stage 3 tax cuts' on one side of the election, and then post the election he says, 'No, we won't; we'll change it and we'll throw it all on its head.' And we now learn that, over days of heated caucus meetings, the Prime Minister has again traded off: 'I'll say what I need to say on this side of the election to get those votes to try and win seats in Tasmania, but I will do nothing to give them long-term protection because I'll make an agreement with the environment minister to allow her to again pursue the creation of a federal environment protection agency, which will open up the capacity to review the salmon industry again.' So the Prime Minister has already begun to strip away what it looks like he's giving the salmon industry today through a dirty backroom deal with his minister. The Tasmanian salmon industry deserves to be protected and isolated from future potentially endless reconsideration requests. So, too, I might add, do all the industries that are currently operating in Australia with environmental approvals and have been for multiple years. It is not fair on them that they always have this question mark hanging over their heads, that they could have their right to operate ripped out from under them on the whim of organisations like the Bob Brown Foundation or the EDO. As we've seen through the aforementioned Blayney goldmine exercise, trying to work with activist groups is an expensive and futile exercise. Australia currently suffers from the second-highest level of green lawfare anywhere in the world. Our companies are under siege. In the interests of the overwhelming majority of Australians, who want us to have a high-functioning economy, who want us to have high levels of employment and who—unlike this government—want us to have a high productivity level which will help reduce the pressure on inflation, we need to stop enabling organisations like the EDO to trash our financial and social wellbeing as a nation, supposedly under the guise of doing it for the environment. We know that you are better off working with industry to maximise sustainability than trying to kill off industry, which is not a viable, long-term solution. Let's not forget the poor red herring or, should I say, maugean skate, in all of this—it's another fish, but not a fish. The poor skate has been used as the enemy of salmon farming. This totally ignores all the steps the industry is taking, and has taken, to improve water quality in Macquarie Harbour and to work to improve outcomes for the skate. I acknowledge that Senator Whish-Wilson, while saying that the science identifies that skate numbers have increased over the years, doesn't accept that that science is robust enough. But others have provided that modelling and indicated that the existence of the skate is not under threat exclusively from salmon farming. So let's look at what other threats there are. Instead of killing off an industry that is actively trying to take steps to help to protect the skate, why don't we work with them to identify what other threats there are? Maybe we can find workarounds there as well, because we need industries like the salmon industry, like broader primary industries—agricultural industries, livestock industries. We need our resources industries. We need projects like the McPhillamys goldmine to go ahead, because it is those industries that underpin the Australian economy, not the green lawfare industry. I call on the government to support the amendments that we will be bringing forward, which will give the salmon industry the certainty that it deserves and needs, so that we can finally put this issue to bed and can get on with trying to increase productivity in Australia, focusing on relieving the cost-of-living pressures, focusing on relieving inflationary pressures and moving this country forward.

Let me start by congratulating Senator Duniam and the entire Tasmanian Liberal team for the work they've done in this area, dragging this government kicking and screaming to make a sensible policy decision in this area. I won't say this bill is a sensible policy decision, because there are many flaws with it, but I do congratulate Senator Duniam and the entire Tasmanian team for the work they've done in standing up for their home state of Tasmania.  Well, there's a whiff of desperation about this government. An absolute stench is emanating from this government. We saw it last night with the budget, where they threw economic responsibility out the window in an attempt at a headline reading 'Tax cut' when all they are delivering to the hardworking people of Australia is less than a cup of coffee a week. It just wanted the headlines, because that's all this government does. It's based on political expediency: attempting to get its own ideological ideas up whilst retaining power at all costs. We saw it with the EPA discussion, when the Prime Minister, with great fanfare, took the cabinet to my home state of Western Australia and very clearly stated that plans for things like the EPA and nature-positive laws had been shelved. Premier Cook made a big show of strength out of it, about how he'd forced change on the federal government—for his own electoral purposes—and the Prime Minister seemed to back him up. Then we get back to this place, and revealed through freedom of information, just a few days after that visit to Western Australia, was this correspondence between the Labor government and the Greens—two groups that have been fighting like Kilkenny cats in here today—undermining what the Prime Minister had publicly said, seeking to do a deal about the EPA, when that had already been ruled out. I'm going to quote from this document. This is coming from the government: I would be grateful for your confirmation that the Australian Greens will support the bills, including the amendments above— We're talking about the EPA bills here— when they come before the Senate. I also seek confirmation, as discussed— So, the deal was being done— that you will support the Government on all procedural votes required to ensure the timely passage of the bills through the Senate as early as possible this sitting week, including on a guillotine or similar motion. There were dirty deals between Labor and the Greens, in here fighting like Kilkenny cats today but doing these dirty deals behind closed doors, saying something very different in my home state of Western Australia. Senator Cash is in the chamber, and Senator O'Sullivan is in the chamber. When we look at this bill, it begs the question: what about the North West Shelf? In the dead of yesterday, in the cover of the budget, the decision on the North West Shelf under the EBPC Act was pushed out until after the election—pushed out again, delayed again. How long has this project been waiting? What state approval process has this project been going through? It's not one year, Senator O'Sullivan—you know this—and not two years, Senator Cash; I know you know this. It is six years—six years through a state approval process. Yet the Labor government still kicks the can down the road. They pretend to support Western Australia. They pretend to support the gas industry. But do they really, when they've got secret deals being done with the Greens over the EPA bills, when they've got the nature-positive bills tucked in the back drawer, just waiting until after the election, when they know they've got to do a deal with the Greens on the crossbench to retain government—or they think they might have to? Well, there's only one way for Western Australians to stop this, and that's to make sure we don't have a minority government after the next election, that we don't have Labor and the Greens doing deals after the next election, whether it's in this place or the other place. The only way we can ensure sensible policy outcomes that support the jobs of all the FIFO workers in Western Australia and that support the jobs in Tasmania that Senator Duniam has talked about is actually to vote Liberal, to make sure we get this government out and we have a majority Liberal government in place, if you care about things like the North West Shelf project in Western Australia, if you know that those jobs are vital to the economy in Western Australia, if you know that the continuation of that project is vital to energy supplies in Western Australia. Western Australia hasn't faced the blackouts, the failures of the energy system, that places like South Australia have faced, because we have access to abundant, cheap gas. But the Labor government is putting that at risk for their own desperate electoral outcomes. We've seen this government betray Western Australia so many times. Close to my heart is the betrayal of the sheep industry in Western Australia. For a few Animal Justice Party preferences in the eastern states, they have forsaken the Western Australian sheep industry, a sheep industry that has already declined, under their watch, by more than 25 per cent and looks like it will decline by 50 per cent over this term of government into the early part of the next term of government.

That means more tax relief, more energy bill relief, more investment in housing and education and a record investment in Medicare and cheaper medicines while improving the budget position by $207 billion compared to what the previous government had projected. Every single Australian taxpayer gets another Labor tax cut next year—unlike the coalition's tax cuts, which only would have gone to the very highest earners. Combined with our first round of tax cuts, the average Australian worker will earn a tax cut of $43 per week or more than $2,200 per year.  Mr Dutton immediately announced that he'll oppose tax relief for working families. Mr Dutton wants to cut everything except your taxes. This morning he said on Radio National that he admires Tony Abbott's approach to the budget, which we'll all remember was to break promises and make the biggest cuts to Medicare and education we've seen in this nation's history. We know he's more interested in what's good for Gina Rinehart than what's good for every Australian. Under Mr Dutton, Australian families will be worse off. They've proven that by opposing Labor's tax cuts for every taxpayer, and it's not once but twice they've done that. Mr Dutton will cut Medicare to pay for his nuclear reactors, but he won't cut income tax for every taxpayer. Unlike Mr Dutton, Labor is strengthening Medicare in the budget, making nine in 10 GP visits by 2030 free. Unlike Mr Dutton, who has committed to scrapping Labor's right to disconnect, ending work from home and even scrapping penalty rates, we are taking more action to grow wages and strengthen working rights. We are banning non-compete clauses that are stopping more than three million Australian workers switching to higher paid jobs. Independent research shows that'll lift the wages of the average worker by over $2,500 a year. The big business council was complaining last night that they don't like workers having freedom to change their jobs even more. Our priority is ensuring working families earn more and keep more of what they earn. Mr Dutton wants you working longer and harder for less. You can contrast the Albanese government's budget with the absolute shambles on offer from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, has just spent a month lurching from one scandal to the next. First, his mystery share purchases are still a mystery. Mr Dutton still refuses to explain his bank share purchases made the day before a government bailout in 2009. How much money did he make? We still don't know. Then there were the stories about Mr Dutton's secret $30 million property portfolio—by the way, he said that means you're not particularly rich—which might explain why he has voted against every single housing affordability measure introduced by this government. Next up, while Queenslanders were pulling together to protect their communities from Cyclone Alfred, Mr Dutton secretly flew down to Sydney to attend a fundraising party at the mansion of one of Australia's biggest wage thieves. When Mr Dutton's own community was filling sandbags, he was a thousand kilometres away down south filling money bags. Then he declared war on work-from-home arrangements, saying he would force people back into the office five days a week, punishing regional workers and those in the outer suburbs and working parents juggling jobs and careers. Then Mr Dutton had another thought bubble. He threatened to break up the big insurance companies. But, within days, his own shadow Treasurer, shadow finance minister and deputy leader all ruled it out. Then Mr Dutton doubled back, saying that divestiture was still on the table, only to be contradicted again just hours later by the shadow Treasurer. Then Mr Dutton floated a referendum to give himself the power to deport five million Australians who were dual citizens. After two years of complaining about how much referendums cost, he decided on the spot that he wanted another one—and, yet again, his own frontbenchers contradicted him. One Liberal figure told the ABC: It's insane, and none of us were told about this. Another said: We need to be focused on the cost of living and not hypothetical changes to constitution. Even former coalition Attorney-General, George Brandis, called it: … as mad an idea as I have heard in a long time. Within 12 hours of Mr Dutton doubling down on that idea, Liberal MPs were being told internally that they shouldn't mention Mr Dutton's referendum anymore. This was all capped off by the shadow Treasurer's train-wreck interview on Insiders just last weekend, where he repeatedly refused to say how much their nuclear policy would cost. He didn't know their migration policy, their energy policy or their defence policy. You can see why he refused to debate the Treasurer when he folded like a deck chair under a gentle line of questioning from David Speers. This past month was a warning to all Australians of what's to come if Peter Dutton ever gets the keys to the Lodge: no policy, no vision and no economic plan—not one that he's going to share with you, but one that he's got waiting for you if are to elect him. He has said there will be $350 billion worth of cuts to services that he won't tell you about until after the election. Other than his $350 billion worth of cuts to essential services and his $10 billion for taxpayer funded lunches for bosses, Mr Dutton has announced not one other policy. The shadow minister for finance, Jane Hume, has said—and Peter Dutton has also said—that people will be forced back into the office five days per week because, and I quote: It has become a right that is creating inefficiency. She then cited a study from Stanford University to support her claim. If she had actually bothered to read the report, she would have seen that it said, and I quote: 'Working from home one or two days a week improves productivity.' Can you believe it? It's taken three years for them to come up with a single policy that's based on a report they didn't even read, let alone understand. There has been massive blowback against this because of the negative impact, especially on working parents and women. Then, when Mr Dutton was asked about this, he said—and this is a clanger—and I quote: 'There are plenty of job-sharing arrangements.' How tone-deaf can you be? Mr Dutton thinks that, if a working parent can't be in the office five days per week, they should just go back to working part time. He wants to go back to the days of old when many women were forced to drop out of the workforce when they had to have a child. It's just shocking. But it gets worse. Their policy will supposedly only apply to public sector workers at first. But we all know big business will follow their lead and demand everyone else back to work five days a week. New data reveals that one in three working Australians work at least one day per week from home, 320,000 people work partially from home because of caring responsibilities and 600,000 people work partially from home to save time and money from commuting. So those one in three workers are saving almost $5,000 a year on transport, parking and other savings. That is how much you'll be worse off each year if Mr Dutton gets to fulfil his dream of killing off work from home. Whether it's his cuts to Medicare and energy bill relief or his policy of ending working from home, everything Mr Dutton says or does takes money out of the pockets of Aussie families and puts it in the pockets of his paymasters, the billionaires like Gina Rinehart and Justin Hemmes. When Peter Dutton makes cuts to please his donors, it's Australians who pay.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","93","Senator HUGHES","273828","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I feel like this could be the claytons valedictory. Welcome to the just-in-case valedictory volume 2. Last night, I recognised some of the people who have played such a vital role over the past six years, and I know there are plenty missing, so I do hope that we come back after the election so I can deliver a real one. But I want to cover off some of the issues that have shaped my time in this place.  I'm reluctant to start with autism, as I could be here for the entire 10 minutes and more, but I do want to say that one of my proudest achievements in this place was the Senate select committee I chaired that covered autism—whole-of-life, not just early intervention and childhood, and not just the vocal late-in-life diagnosed. We looked at profound autism, autism that affects every aspect of life, not just the glossy rubbish of 'autism is a superpower'. Sometimes autism is hard—really hard. It's hard for the autistic person, their family and their community. It affects access to the health system, the education system and employment and interactions with the justice system. Mental health issues are dismissed as just part of the autism. Our first recommendation was the establishment of a National Autism Strategy. It's happened, even if it took two years for this government to produce a reasonably poor summation of the 81 recommendations that my committee made. It now has some funding to be rolled out. Not being part of the government, I would have hoped this would have been an area where bipartisan consultation would have occurred, but, alas, I am as in the dark as the rest of the community as to what this actually looks like. To all the families who have children diagnosed with classical autism, profound autism—those before the new and, quite frankly, stupid DSM-5, which bundles our kids in with children experiencing minor developmental delays—I see you. Whilst I'll no longer be in this place to fight for our kids, know that whilst I continue my son's journey, along with my wonderful friend Nicole Rogerson, the total rock star who started Autism Awareness Australia—the epitome of the autism mum—we will still fight for all our kids. Those who try and make decisions that hurt our kids and our families can very much take this as a warning. I spoke yesterday, and have spoken on many occasions, about the NDIS. Again, I could go on for days. But I beg of you, in this place and the other: please put your big boy or big girl pants on and make the tough decisions needed to make this sustainable. Make the big reforms. Cut the numbers through ensuring this scheme is fit for purpose. If one in 37 people in this country have a significant, permanent and lifelong disability, we are in for a world of pain. Get the numbers back down. Define 'permanent', 'significant' and 'lifelong'. Provide other lifeboats for families needing some early intervention. Embrace the insurance part of the scheme; invest early to see improved life outcomes. Don't punish families who use supports correctly and reach goals but are petrified to share their successes because they know that they'll be punished, while those who waste funds are rewarded for not using them appropriately. Use data properly for every participant, especially early intervention. But, in working towards goals, we hear about provider registration. It's about process at the moment, not quality. Some of the highest quality providers are sole providers, who work most closely with families. Introduce a scalable registration process, in line with business size, number of participants or volume of billing. Remove some of the excess levels within and outside the agency. Stop the bureaucracy from dominating, and focus on funding supports. Stop the insane external legal bills to not only fight but break participants and their families, only to then, in the overwhelming majority of cases, give them what they originally wanted on the steps of the tribunal. I will stay on this from outside of this place, but I am not filled with confidence that the third largest item in the budget will get the attention it deserves, because, unfortunately, it's not seen as being as sexy or important as focusing your career here on defence or finance. Somehow or other, along this crazy journey, I became a bit of a vaping queen. It's still beyond me that this policy stupidity of banning vapes continues. Tax them; regulate them. We have the model with cigarettes and alcohol. Instead we see firebombing of stores and organised crime. We see that it is more lucrative for criminal networks to bring in containers of illicit tobacco and vapes than heroin, with much less threat of punishment or penalty. Moral policing has led to policy insanity, with ministers led by the nose by an overzealous health department who rely on the so-called research of discredited and biased so-called academics. I do hope the new policy of a Dutton government will see the end of the criminalisation of smoking cessation. We are certainly not seeing that from this government. I have also had the privilege of working in the mental health portfolio. Whilst I could talk about prevention and early intervention, I really want to say this to the families of loved ones experiencing serious mental illness: the system is letting you down. And, whilst it's true that many of these people are more likely to be victims of crime, I also want to acknowledge the pain of the families left behind when their loved ones become victims of those with mental illness. As many of you are aware, the daughter of my dearest friend, Julie Singleton, was murdered at Bondi Junction last year. It will never be over for Julie or for Dawnie's siblings, yet the mental health system has let them down and we now face the prospect of a coronial inquiry seemingly intent on releasing publicly the footage of what occurred. This is not in the public interest. This is not to benefit the families who lost loved ones. It is insulting to those who lost their lives. It is insulting to those who were there, some of whom were attacked and survived and who've decided to remain anonymous. They could lose that anonymity. This is trauma porn, and, whilst it's a state government issue, we need to show leadership here. Attorneys-general need to unify and stop this further traumatisation of families that is just so the evening news has shock-value footage. I would like to say that I hope none of you or your families ever experience this kind of pain. I wasn't really going to make much of a personal comment here, but I experienced people who ran against me for preselection, and their supporters, using against me my lack of a direct phone call to them in the weeks following this tragedy whilst I worked to support my friend. To all of you that did that: you are a disgrace; you have disgraced yourselves. To those grubs: I hope it was worth it for you. I'd also like to look at antisemitism and the total lack of leadership that we're seeing from this government. I'd like to pay tribute to the strength of the Australian Jewish community and the incredible work exposing so much of this by my friend Sharri Markson. You're an absolute legend, Shar. I got to see my friend Amir Maimon today, the Israeli ambassador. To you, I say: you have many friends who will always stand with Israel and who will always stand with our Jewish friends. We have the most incredible Australian Jews, and I must acknowledge Solomon Lew, who has perhaps given me the most profound advice as I've prepared for my departure from this place: sometimes second prize is actually first prize. Sol, you are so right. I look forward to many more dinners as I navigate my next steps, but I know that the support I have received from the Jewish community I will pay back tenfold, even after my departure. To Joel Burnie, Colin Rubenstein and Tammy Reznik: I was always a Zionist, but you showed me Israel, and it will be an experience I will always treasure and hope to return to very, very soon. I know yesterday we did 'NDIS Monday' on Tuesday, and we've seen the demise of 'transmission Tuesday'. I hope that, whatever we see in the next term of government, we see some openness and some honesty about the true cost of the race to renewables for every Australian and the damage that it is doing to our rural and regional communities, who are forced to bear the brunt of much of this infrastructure. I'll finish on one of the most interesting inquiries that I have had the pleasure of recently participating in. It was one initiated by the Greens on menopause and perimenopause. To all the women of my age: have a look at it. I know Senator Waters was disappointed, as she wanted to see menopause leave supported—which it was not, by anyone, except by the unions—but it has highlighted the need for us to all talk about perimenopause and menopause and to acknowledge that 50 per cent of the population are going to go through this, that the symptoms are complex and that support for women is required. Women aged 50 and above—or sometimes a little younger, as we know—are quite often at their most productive. Their children are grown and they have much career experience. It is the time that we should be supporting women, and I have embraced that in my final few months in this place because every now and then the temperature in here is really unbearable—so, very often now, I remove my jacket as a little bit of an acknowledgement that we need to be more open and accessible to all.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","96","Senator STEELE-JOHN","250156","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Once upon a time in Australia, buying a house was not just something aspired to but something you could actually expect to achieve. Now the dream of homeownership is out of reach for many. Renters and first home buyers don't stand a chance.  Recently a report from the group Everybody's Home showed that even people on a salary of $100,000 struggle to pay rent due to rapidly rising rent prices and unbearable cost-of-living increases. My home state of WA had some of the most stark results, showing that, on average, those earning $100,000 were spending 55 per cent of their income on rent if they lived in the northern suburbs of our state, while in Perth they were paying an average of 43 per cent. Rents across WA have skyrocketed in recent years. In the electorate of Perth, rents have risen 45 per cent; to give you an idea of what that actually means, that's $225 a week in the past two years. In Fremantle, it is 43 per cent. In Swan, it is 54 per cent. Rents aren't the only thing that have skyrocketed in price. Year after year, the cost of groceries has increased by double digits, leaving senior food analysts to determine that steeper food costs are becoming ingrained in our economy and will be 'an ongoing reality' for people. That means that high prices are here to stay. This will have a crushing effect on our community, who are already struggling to pay for necessities. Alongside our WA Greens volunteers, we have knocked on tens of thousands of doors in the last few months and the message is resoundingly clear: this government is not doing enough to help with the cost of living. The housing situation in this country is a political choice. When you understand that the average politician in the Australian parliament owns 2.5 houses, and when you know that the major parties have accepted millions in donations from big corporations, property developers and corporate landlords, you can see why the major parties and major party politicians are choosing to keep this cycle going. I've heard from young families having to decide between the cost of medical care and the cost of groceries. I've heard from renters who are being priced out of their homes and out of their suburbs. I've heard from first home buyers who don't know how they are going to pay for their mortgage with these high interest rates. What is most upsetting is that these are not unique stories; they are stories I've heard from hundreds of people across Western Australia, from Perth to Esperance, from Fremantle to Broome. The Greens are the only ones offering a plan that will give renters and first home buyers an actual chance. We've listened carefully to the community on doorsteps, at free barbecues and in town halls. We can bring the community's voice into this parliament. We need to end the corporate influence on the decisions that are made in our parliament. The good news is that it does not have to be this way; things can change. This election is an opportunity to create change together. The Greens plan for housing will freeze and then cap rents so that people aren't being forced out of their homes and communities because they don't know how they will pay next week's rent, so that renters have someone in their corner. We'll establish a national renters protection authority to establish and enforce renters' rights. We can bring down mortgages by regulating the banks to deliver fairer, lower mortgages. We'll build millions of affordable and public homes by setting up a government property developer that will create high-quality housing and rentals that people can actually afford. We must phase out the tax handouts that are going to wealthy property investors right now. Those with more than one property investment in this country can do an incredible amount to reduce their tax exposure. It is just not on that in this country there is a set of tax handouts that enable someone to utilise a place where a person could live as a structure to lower their personal income tax. We have to end these tax handouts for any property investor who owns more than one home. This means—let me be blunt—phasing out the capital gains tax discount and doing the same with negative gearing for every property after the first one. Our community is facing a cost-of-living crisis, and we must take bold action. People are sick of half-measures, and this is exactly why we need more Greens in our federal parliament. In this cost-of-living crisis, we need this parliament to look at all the possible areas to take the pressure off our community. This is exactly what the Greens' plan includes. We need to get back to everyone having a secure home. We'll freeze and then cap rents and regulate the big banks so renters and first-home buyers actually stand a chance again. We need to be able to build for everybody a healthcare system that delivers health care that people can afford, when and where they need it. We'll build thousands of new free local healthcare clinics across the country that will offer access to GPs, dentists, psychologists and nurse practitioners for free. We can and must extend Medicare to cover dental care, expand access to mental health care and make it easier to get ADHD and autism diagnoses under Medicare. The Greens plan would also wipe student debt and make going to university free again, which so many in this place had the opportunity to benefit from decades ago. We must lower the price of going to the supermarket. We must stop the supermarket chains price gouging our community. We must make price gouging illegal, and we must break up the duopoly that is Coles and Woolies. Our community is facing a cost-of-living crisis, and we must take bold action, not just half-measures. Everything this government chooses to do is a political choice. The budget was a political choice and, unfortunately for our community, this government continues to choose to tinker around the edges rather than doing what is needed. At this election we have the opportunity to do something historic, but we have to vote for it. Nothing changes if nothing changes. And be assured: so many in this place are content with the status quo. That is why it is more important than ever to vote Green so we can get to work helping our community and send a message to the political duopoly that the status quo is no longer accepted. So, this election, 'Vote 1 Greens' and be part of something that is bold, that is hopeful and that will create real and meaningful change for our community.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","99","Senator STERLE","e68","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Last Saturday evening I had the pleasure of attending a very special celebration in Perth. It was the 30th anniversary of KEYS: The Moving Solution's operations in Western Australia—and may I put on the record that Nick D'Adamo, the managing director, and his lovely wife have been personal friends of my wife and I for 45 years. I'm happy to have seen a family business flourish as it has.  Nick came to me as a young 20-year-old and started in the transport industry. His background was as a mechanic. Nick came on as my co-driver, my offsider, running through the Pilbara and the Kimberley in an old cab-over 1418 with no air-conditioning. Nick then bought his own truck and became a very successful operator as an owner-driver. He then branched out with other dear friends Matt and June Gill and took over Keys Brothers Removals and turned it from a little outfit that was going nowhere into a very successful transport and removal business. Good on you, Nick and Janine and Matt and June. Well done! I'd like to place on record my congratulations not only to the D'Adamos and the Gills but to the entire team at KEYS for their professionalism and dedication to the WA community. To this day, there are still a few of the old drivers left who we were drivers together with at Ridgeway, and it's great to see the old faces. Trust me when I say that working as a removalist is hard work. I know. That's how I got my start in the transport industry. Professional removal companies know that their role isn't just about moving goods and possessions from one residence to another, whether around the corner or around the globe; it's about helping individuals and families start anew and embrace new opportunities. A removal company that is truly professional, as KEYS is, knows the degree of trust placed in them by people at what can be a very stressful time. That's what makes the team at KEYS so special: they make sure that any move is as smooth and as stress-free as possible. Congratulations to everyone at KEYS in WA on reaching that special 30th anniversary milestone, and let's hope there may be many more decades of success ahead. To show the respect that KEYS and the team have, there were not only the employees, the teams and owner-drivers but also, importantly, clients and past employees of theirs. It was truly a family evening. Well done, Nick. Well done, Matt. As I said, may there be many, many more. I want to turn now to a different subject. It would be remiss of me to not spend a couple of minutes talking about what happened in WA a couple of weekends ago. I'd like to congratulate my good friend Roger Cook, the Premier of Western Australia, on his superb election result on 8 March. Roger's win is the ultimate proof that good and decent people can succeed in politics. Roger and his team won a third consecutive four-year term in a landslide, making WA Labor the first party to win a third term in Western Australia since 1989. The third consecutive landslide victory since winning government in 2017 is truly remarkable and is due to Roger's dedication to our community and his bold vision for our state, the great state of Western Australia. WA Labor now holds 46 seats in the Legislative Assembly, compared to the seven seats won by the WA Liberals and the six won by the National Party. We have 46; the coalition has 13. The seven seats that the Liberals now hold mean that they can reclaim the official opposition status. Personally, I'm struggling to work out who is the bigger electoral asset for WA Labor: the new leader of the opposition, Basil Zempilas, or the former leader of the Nationals, Shane Love. Mr Zempilas has already said that his election to the Liberal Party leadership is a reset. Surely, the first priority for Mr Zempilas and his ragtag team must be to address the WA Liberals' disastrous candidate selection. Make no mistake: the WA division is still in the grip of the religious right. You only have to look at their candidate selection in Albany—not to say anything about the Kimberley one who was disendorsed. The WA election result was a resounding endorsement of our Premier, Roger Cook, and his powerful vision for our state.

Labor is rushing through a bill to trash environmental laws. They've already ditched their promise to strengthen nature protections, but they're not stopping there. They now have the audacity to water them down, and for what? To give big corporations free rein to pollute our environment as they profit from the destruction of the planet. Prime Minister Albanese caves in all too easily to the mining industry, to the coal and gas corporations, to the salmon-fishing industry and to Mr Dutton. In this last week of parliament before the election, Labor could have been working with the Greens to wipe all student debt and to put dental into Medicare. But instead, under the cover of the budget, they are working with the Liberals to gut our environmental laws.  In Tasmania, the multinational fish-farming corporations are poisoning our waterways, polluting coastlines, suffocating salmon in oxygen-starved waters and driving an ancient fish species into extinction. Salmon farming is indeed the factory farming of the sea, and it is destroying the homes of endangered species like the red handfish and the maugean skate. Instead of protecting rivers, bays, oceans and species, Labor is protecting big, toxic salmon-farming corporations and their profits. Peak environmental organisations, including Greenpeace and the ACF, have called Labor out for leaving our environment worse off than it was at the last election. If nothing else, it should be shamefully embarrassing for Labor to be worse on the environment than Mr Morrison's Liberals were. Neither Labor nor Liberals can be trusted on the environment. That is why people are sick and tired of the two-party system. They are sick and tired of being taken for granted. People are ready to smash the two-party system once and for all. They know how cooked the system is when, in the midst of a boiling, flooding and burning world, Labor has approved more than 30 coal and gas projects. They know how broken the system is when the big supermarkets here are the most profitable in the world and people are skipping meals. They know the two parties work for corporations and billionaires like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer, not everyday people. They know how cooked the system is when Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza with full impunity from both of the big parties. People know how broken it is when Islamophobia is rife in the country and little or nothing is done to combat it. I remind the Senate of Senator Sharma's shameful claim that there is 'a fictitious Islamophobia which was not going on'—and not a word of condemnation from anyone in this place. Imagine if that had been said about any other group. You would all have been up in arms. Here's a newsflash for you: Islamophobia exists and it is extensively documented. The latest Islamophobia Register's report documents the steep rise in anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hate. Over a two-year period, 700 Islamophobic incidents were reported—one a day—and there would be so many more that were not reported. Muslim women are overwhelmingly the targets of this vile hate. Muslim women are being spat at and punched in the face and are having their hijabs torn off. Racist graffiti is rampant, and two mosques have now had threats referencing the Christchurch mosque massacre, where an Australian man with an extreme, far-right, white supremacist and Islamophobic ideology murdered 51 Muslims. But, to the Liberal Party, Muslim lives simply don't matter, and we've known that for a very long time. And Labor just sits on its hands, treats us as second-class citizens and offers us platitudes once in a while. Labor could have fully funded the National Anti-Racism Framework in this budget but did nothing. We've had enough. We're not some passive bystanders or hapless victims. People are organising and mobilising. People know that they don't have to contend with the dangerous Trump-mirroring, fearmongering Liberals, nor will they give the morally compromised Labor government, one mired in mediocrity, a free pass. They know the Greens will always be a strong voice for people and planet. In minority government, the Greens will keep Dutton out and will put the heat on Labor to deliver for people, not for corporate profits. Bring it on.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","104","Senator DARMANIN","301128","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Right now, Australian Services Union members are leading the charge for fairer wages and better conditions by pursuing the largest worker initiated single-interest employer authorisation, covering over 7,000 workers at 11 Victorian metropolitan councils. Workers at Merri-bek, Yarra, Darebin, Hobsons Bay, Melbourne, Greater Dandenong, Port Phillip and Maribyrnong city councils have overwhelmingly endorsed pursuing a multi-employer agreement. This is an historic opportunity for local government workers to stand together and demand the pay and conditions they deserve, made possible by laws delivered by this Labor government.  Over six weeks, fabulous ASU delegates, like Craig from Darebin, Mel from Yarra, Dylan from Melbourne and so many more, have been leading this charge—holding meetings, mobilising workers and having crucial conversations to bring workers together as one industry. Last week, more than 60 delegates from councils across Melbourne came together to demonstrate the strength and solidarity that comes from working as one industry. The commitment and hard work of these delegates is unwavering. They are seizing the opportunities of the long-awaited workplace reform for better pay and conditions and advocating tirelessly for their colleagues. Without their dedication, this would not be possible. By standing together, these workers are working together to make this vision a reality. We in the Labor movement believe in the collective. Labor governments stand proudly with workers to collectivise and to get a better deal. For more than a decade, single-enterprise bargaining has allowed some employers to delay, divide and deny workers the pay rises that they have deserved. Under the coalition, enterprise bargaining collapsed to the point where only 14 per cent of workers were covered by an agreement that was in date. Wages were low and falling, and inflation was rising. But, after a decade of wage stagnation under the coalition, we are getting wages moving again. Our multi-employer bargaining laws are giving workers like Craig, Mel, Dylan and their colleagues real power to negotiate together for better. Multi-employer bargaining means employers cannot put an agreement to a vote without union consent, ending dodgy tactics of bypassing workers and undermining negotiations. Workers across multiple councils who do the same work across different municipalities use their collective power to increase the visibility and importance of their work to the community and pressure for fair outcomes. They can share experience and expertise across councils, focusing on winning the best conditions for everyone. These laws are making a real difference. They are bringing more employers, unions and workers to the table to negotiate agreements to deliver fair pay and better conditions. But, make no mistake, all of this is at risk. We know some employers don't like these changes. Recently, Brimbank City Council have displayed rank union busting, the likes of which have not been seen in local government in recent living memory. Workplace delegates have been illegally targeted, simply for exercising their rights. We will see an explosion of this sort of anti-union behaviour from bosses and workers' rights trampled on if Mr Dutton is back in charge of workers' rights in this country. Mr Dutton has made it clear that they will tear up these hard-won rights if they get the chance. On multi-employer bargaining, Mr Dutton has said that it's a 'disaster' and that a coalition government will clean up the mess of multi-employer bargaining. The mess Mr Dutton should be referring to is that of his own party's making. The Labor government has been cleaning up that mess, every day, since 2022. Under Labor, wages are up, jobs are up and inflation is down. Those opposite have voted against laws to clean up that mess, every step of the way, and Australian workers know that cutting workers' rights is a risk. When he cuts, you pay. Under the coalition, workers would lose the right to disconnect; multi-employer bargaining, leaving wages stagnant; gender equity protections; and same job, same pay rules that ensure fair treatment at work. But Australian workers know better. They know that only a Labor government holds the values of collectivism at its core and that only a Labor government has their backs, delivering higher wages, better working conditions and the job security every worker deserves.

They're as Australian as Vegemite, the Hill's hoist and, my favourite, the budgie smuggler—preferably not with Tony Abbott in them. No pun intended. Uggs were invented in the 1930s, and Aussie surfers made them popular in the 1970s. One of those surfers was Brian Smith, and he saw an opportunity. He moved to the states and trademarked the UGG boot name. Seventeen years later he sold the company for millions to Deckers Outdoor Corporation, a multinational company worth billions.  I wasn't happy about that. It just seems wrong for a US company to own such an Aussie iconic name. We still have companies in Australia making the traditional ugg boots. Look for that 'Made in Australia' sign, guys; it's got to have Skippy on it. But our Australian ugg boot makers are being bullied by Deckers, the company that bought the Aussie founder out. When an American bought a pair of Aussie made uggs from an Australian ugg company—and good on you, by the way, to that American for buying Australian—Deckers sued that company for using the UGG name and stopped them from using the name to sell their products in the United States. This is despite the fact that the US has allowed other generic name products from Japan, Mexico, Hungary and many others but not Australia. How about that? That was a hint of where we are now. America is no longer our mate. The Aussie ugg boot makers asked for the US Supreme Court to hear the case, and, of course, they were turned down. Now Aussie ugg boot makers want to take their case to the World Trade Organization, but here's the brick wall—this government and Minister Farrell apparently couldn't give a stuff. In this David and Goliath battle they have chosen a side, and it's USA all the way. This government loves to talk about a future made in Australia. Here is a perfect opportunity to stand up for Aussie manufacturers, but they have basically told them to get stuffed. I couldn't find Aussie ugg boots with Skippy attached in the local Canberra shopping centre, in Myer or in David Jones. If the government was serious about making Australian made again, they would give these Aussie companies the money they need to fight for our Aussie-made ugg boots at the World Trade Organization. It would probably cost a lot less than the money this government throws around trying to stop documents being released under the freedom-of-information rules. Get this, Australians: this government has spent nearly a million bucks trying to stop Rex Patrick from getting documents on everything from robodebt to radioactive waste management and oil and gas taxation. That's a million dollars of taxpayers' money used to hide information from the Australian people. So why can't Minister Farrell find the money to back our Aussie ugg makers? This government says they want a future made in Australia; I want Australia to make again now. So what is going on? I have to say: here it is for people that want to see it. It's called the Aussie ugg. It's got Skippy on it.

We're living through a cost-of-living crisis, a climate emergency, a housing disaster and a world on the brink of deeper conflict, and what does Treasurer Jim Chalmers hand us? He hands us a pre-election pamphlet dressed up as a budget. Let's be clear: this was not a budget of vision. It was a budget of fear—fear of upsetting vested interests, fear of telling the truth and fear of spooking voters with the scale of the challenge we face. Instead of delivering structural reform, we got bandaids. Instead of building a future, we got a bribe: $5 a week in tax cuts. That's not relief; that's an insult. And don't forget that $5 is across the board, including for those who need it the least, like the wealthy and people in this chamber. This government is too scared to truly rebalance the scales for the needy.  Who misses out entirely in this budget? It's full-time students working part time, the young people hustling to get by, drowning in HECS debt and rising rents. There is nothing for them. I spent years in Young Labor and one term as Young Labor president. I ran the meetings, moved and seconded motions for national platform, prepared for state and national conferences and heard the demands from young members to push for real, brave reform. Do you want to know what they want from their Labor Party, what I wanted? They want action on negative gearing. They want the capital gains tax discount gone. They want franking credits reined in. They want real climate action, not gas expansion. They want big corporations taxed properly. They want AUKUS scrapped. They want a sovereign wealth fund to safeguard our future. They want a gas reservation policy that puts Australians first. They want welfare payments that are raised to liveable standards. They want offshore detention to end. They want a foreign policy that's truly independent, not just a rubber stamp for Washington. All the Labor senators in this chamber know this to be true. These are bold, progressive, commonsense reforms, and—would you believe it?—every single one of them is what Australia's Voice is fighting for. It's so obvious that Labor can't even deliver what's already in their own party platform, let alone take the bold steps needed to meet this moment. They talk big on fairness, then cave to donors. They talk big on security, then sell our sovereignty to AUKUS. They talk big on care, then leave people on poverty payments. This is a budget with no backbone, no direction and no long-term plan. To my former Young Labor crew out there: you know this isn't good enough. You know this isn't the bold, progressive Labor of the old. Don't be scared to tell them.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","114","Senator VAN","283601","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I'd like to congratulate the Treasurer on his budget last night. There aren't many Treasurers who get to do four budgets in one parliament—and, yes, I know that last night's budget was focused on the upcoming election. That's not a criticism; that's just what parties of power do in a pre-budget election.  However, let's look at what the budget is really about. The budget is, first and foremost, about the financial underpinning of our economy. I just want to get on the record that our economy is facing some very significant challenges over the coming decades. Currently, our economy is underpinned by exports of iron ore, coal and natural gas—$138 billion in exports of iron ore, $90 billion in exports of coal and $92 billion in exports of natural gas. It makes up a huge part of our economy. Yet all those things are going to come under pressure, if not disappear altogether, as the world moves towards a low- or no-carbon future. This doesn't even have to be an ideological argument. Our iron ore is low grade, and as steel furnace plants turn to electricity to be able to do direct reduction furnaces they need the higher grade iron ores that are going to be available out of Latin America and Africa. To shore up some of these exports, we need to be looking at producing our own green metals, and particularly green iron. But to do that we're going to need to do a large number of things, and very few of them got mentioned in the budget last night. It was heartening to hear that green metals did get a mention in the budget under the Future Made in Australia program, which I happily support—although I would argue, and I have argued in this place, for more direct production credits for things such as green iron, green aluminium, low-carbon liquid fuels and sustainable aviation fuel. These are all things that are going to be incredibly necessary in our economy moving forward because to be able to produce all that green iron you need an awful lot of clean electricity. At the moment we can't even get the electricity generation for our own grid down to low or no carbon. We're barely removing any of the coal fleet, and yet we're spending billions of dollars on building more transmission to run that electricity from one coal-fired plant to another. In the budget last night there was even more money for more transmission, and I think some of it is necessary, with the $10 million Accelerated Connection Fund. It's going to help some renewable generation connect to the grid, but it's a far cry from the $4 billion and $5 billion state interconnected projects that aren't going anywhere, are only going to go up in cost and don't generate one electron, don't store one kilowatt hour. These are not the things that are going to help us go to a clean energy, green metal future. I applauded the government earlier this year in announcing $250 million for low-carbon liquid fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel. But what we need is production credits for those, and I moved an amendment on that in the last sitting. What we need is mandates. We need our Defence Force to agree to start using renewable diesel. We need to put mandates on our government fleets to start using it. These are the things that are going to make a difference to bringing on these clean fuels and clean energy for our future. Even the Trump government is spending $70 billion on a renewable diesel or low-carbon fuel plant in Montana.

It has been quite the rocky road to get to this point. There have been a few stumbles along the way, but I do think we now have a plan that all Queenslanders and all Australians can get behind and deliver the best games ever in 2032. That's certainly been the reaction I've heard from Queenslanders overnight, while I've been down here. I have had the privilege to know a little bit about these things. We have, for most of this parliament, had a Senate inquiry established on the planning for the games and, as the chair of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, I have been leading that inquiry through that time.  As I said, it's great to get to this moment. For a while there, there were some concerns—particularly when the former Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, decided to abolish the independent organising committee that had been such a successful model for the Sydney Olympics and other Olympics subsequent to Sydney. She had decided to abolish that after the election of the Albanese government. The independent committee was a request of the federal Morrison government, before. Things seemed to go downhill after that. Decision-making was centralised in the Premier's office. We had a proposal for the Gabba to be used as the major stadium, which seemed to come from nowhere and certainly wasn't properly costed at the time. Subsequent to Premier Palaszczuk stepping down as Premier, new Premier Miles decided to scrap that and move to upgrading the old QEII Stadium, in Brisbane, now known as QSAC. That seemed to come from absolutely nowhere, and the drawings that were produced did look a little bit embarrassing. There was an attempt to almost have a cut-price games, at the time, in the lead-up to the 2024 election. But all that's been swept aside now. We can forget all about that. The independent organising committee has been re-established. The new government established a 100-day review to look through all this stuff, as quickly as they could, and I do think the plan that was delivered yesterday is fantastic. One of the reasons I think this plan is much superior to what was on the table before is that it is a plan that involves all Queenslanders. Queensland is such a big, wonderful state and, unlike most states in this country, it is quite regionally dispersed. We have large population centres a fair way from the capital city of Brisbane. Indeed, still, to this day, about half of Queenslanders live outside of the capital city—very, very different from most other states in this country. I myself live in a region away from Brisbane, in the Rockhampton region. Many of us were perplexed that we were going to have to pay for this wonderful event, all the way down in Brisbane, and not see much of it at all. But now we have the opportunity to involve all Queenslanders, to sell Queensland to the world. The previous plan that the LNP inherited had just a few football games occurring in Townsville and Cairns. Hardly the high-profile, marquee events at an Olympics, they were just qualifying games for the football. That was in stark contrast to the last successful Paris Olympics. Even in Paris, six sports, across 10 cities, were played at least 200 kilometres from Paris. They used their whole country. In fact, you probably remember, they had surfing in Tahiti but many other sports spread right through France as well. It would be a shame for us not to do the same thing. Now we have a plan that involves all Queenslanders. We have the equestrian events going to Toowoomba, which has wonderful heritage as a rural, agricultural town. They'll do a great job with that. We have archery being proposed for Maryborough—a beautiful, historic town—showcasing that part of Queensland.

I think each games has the ability to add a couple of local events. I have a few places I'd suggest for the pigging! We could market western Queensland as well. But you distract me, Senator Pocock. We've got the sailing up in the Whitsundays and Townsville. That's a wonderful idea. Why would we not use the games as a vehicle to sell and market the Great Barrier Reef to the world? Hosting the sailing through the Whitsundays will be a wonderful opportunity to do that. Cairns will continue to host football, as well as some indoor sports events. That will mean infrastructure upgrades throughout regional Queensland.  That brings me to my hometown of Rockhampton. After the push from a number of locals last year we've been successful in having the rowing moved to Rockhampton. It was an amazing result for my community and my region. We're often overlooked, but the Liberal-National party team—they're in Central Queensland—always fights for our region. I was fortunate enough to be joined by the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, and newly elected state MPs Donna Kirkland for Rockhampton, Nigel Hutton for Keppel and Glen Kelly out at Mirani. All of them got behind this vision. We have a wonderful rowing facility already in Rockhampton. It's often used by the Australian Olympic team to train. The state school championships are held there annually. We will now also have the ability to sell the Australian bush, with the beautiful gumtree-lined river there, the Fitzroy River. It's also connected to the reef as well, which is just 40 minutes away. So I'm very excited about that. There's nothing like a crocodile to sell newspapers, is there? That's what I've discovered over the last few days. People love them. They just love crocodiles and they love hearing and talking about them. It's sort of strange to me—and we scratch our heads up there—when everyone's saying that somehow there'll be world records set because the crocodiles will be chasing the rowers, rah, rah, rah. Well, how is it that we can allow 700 of our children, school children, to compete in the Fitzroy River every year but that apparently there's going to be a huge risk for Olympians? If there was a risk for Olympians, why would we as parents allow that? I should say that I've got skin in this game. My son rows on the Fitzroy River three or four times every week, normally, in training. It's perfectly safe. It has been used for a hundred years. In fact, no-one has ever been killed by a crocodile in Central Queensland. They do exist in different places, but they're well managed, and our river is very safe for human purposes. I'm sure we'll be very successful. More recently we have heard about issues of streamflow in the Fitzroy. Again, a few of us are scratching our heads. There are people who don't want the rowing in Rocky, and I understand that, but there has to be a winner and a loser in these things. Now people are saying the river will flow and that that will cause interruptions to the event. First of all the river does have barrages, which are not tidal at all. It flows from the ocean and is contained. The streamflow from upstream doesn't really happen at this time of the year. That's why the locals don't understand this issue. We're a subtropical environment. Almost all of our rain—95 per cent—occurs in the summer months. In the winter months, as a recent hydrological study of the Fitzroy River concluded, the river slows to almost zero flow. I've had a look at this in detail in the last couple of days, since the issue was raised, and the streamflow gauges that we have show a flow in winter, in July to August, when the Olympics will occur, at well below the world rowing association's threshold of 0.1 metres per second. I should say that the world rowing association has been very flexible for LA. In LA, the rowing is occurring at a marine stadium that is impacted by tidal flows. In fact, the course will just be 1,500 metres—500 metres shorter than normal—to allow LA to host the rowing in the Long Beach area, where so many other events will be. In terms of the flows there, when the world rowing association went to do its feasibility study, it detected flows of 0.15 metres, which is 50 per cent higher than the allowed threshold, and yet it has still approved the holding of this event there. So there's obviously a degree of flexibility. I think it's now time to just get behind this plan. I've had some conversations with colleagues on the other side. They seem happy and excited. I hope we can put aside the politics now and deliver this great event for all Australians. I remember as a young person that I was probably a little sceptical of the Sydney Olympics leading up to it—we all watched the games and those sorts of things—but, geez, it was a wonderful event. It was so good in bringing our country together. It was done brilliantly. All credit to Sydney and the people who organised it. We all remember it. So now we've got the opportunity for the same thing for a new generation of Australians, especially those young Australians who compete at the highest level. It will be an amazing opportunity for them to compete on their home soil and hopefully win as many gold medals as possible for Australia, and we can all celebrate with them.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","120","Senator DAVID POCOCK","256136","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I want to start by acknowledging that over the last three years Labor has made some major investments in areas that people in the ACT care deeply about: education, housing, the cost of living and of course health, which was definitely the hero in this budget. The focus on women's health care is particularly welcome, given the massive gender bias that currently exists in medicine. At the last election the people of the ACT voted for an Independent senator for the first time in our history because, as they told me, they wanted someone who would stand up for Canberra and the things we care about most. At the last election I heard that integrity, climate and the environment topped that list. So, while I acknowledge the progress, I also need to emphasise how far we still have to go.  Despite Labor promising at the last election to do better than a decade of coalition neglect, the ACT has missed out again, in Labor's fourth budget. I know the four Labor representatives for Canberra and the ACT Labor government are at pains to disagree with me on this, but the facts speak for themselves. The PM's promise of nine out of 10 visits to the doctor being bulk-billed will not work in the ACT. I have surveyed every GP practice in the ACT, and that's what they've told me. Gap fees will continue to be among the highest in the country. So where's the strategy for the ACT? Yes, there's extra funding for public hospitals, but the Commonwealth isn't funding anywhere near its 45 per cent share here in the ACT. There's $50 million for the Monaro Highway while some of our other massively congested and dangerous roads get overlooked. At the same time, other jurisdictions get tens of billions of dollars. Yes, you're building a national security precinct in Barton, and, whilst that's great for the top security-clearance holders who will use it, it's not the convention centre, stadium or multipurpose arena that the community has been crying out for for decades—projects that would not just create welcome construction jobs but also be vital to ongoing economic activity and community benefit. 'Light rail', I hear you say. We still don't know how much stage 2B will cost and what the Commonwealth will contribute. As it is with the national security precinct, the public doesn't know. In terms of the AIS, I think everyone in Canberra believes that if the ACT hadn't voted Independent then the AIS would have been moved to Queensland by now—just like the Centre for Disease Control that was on its way to Melbourne but will now be based in Canberra and will hopefully help fill some of our critical medical workforce shortages. What about housing? Yes, thanks to negotiations with the Senate crossbench, the ACT will get a fair share of the Housing Australia Future Fund. But what about the old CSIRO Ginninderra site that was promised for desperately needed new social and affordable housing in the town that has the highest rate of persistent homelessness in the country? Why hasn't the government waived the historic housing debt as Senator Gallagher promised when Labor was in opposition? Most critically of all, where is the funding for nature? We've gone backwards on environmental laws this term despite all the promises that things would be different. My message is simple. Being less bad than the coalition isn't good enough. That can't be the message that we hear. Canberrans deserve better. We need specific investments in Canberra, a growing city. Yes, we've seen investments in the national capital—leaking roofs fixed at the gallery. But you can't just count things that you're doing for everyone else as special investments in Canberra. Things like urgent care clinics are very welcome, but they don't cut it as saying, 'This is how we're investing in the ACT.' We've been dudded for decades, and it's past time that Canberra caught up. We can't continue to be taken for granted. We heard the government announce the National Capital Investment Framework at the ACT Labor Conference. It's a great start, but at the moment it just sounds like a bunch of pieces of paper; nothing has been delivered. So, whilst there's rhetoric, I urge the government: let's see some action; let's see some investment in our nation's capital.

It is a budget that offers no help to households and holds out no hope for business. It is a budget that will only perpetuate the malaise and stagnation felt across the Australian economy.  This budget does not get to grips with wasteful, out-of-control government spending. This year, real government spending will grow by six per cent and the economy only by 1.5 per cent. Government spending is at a record 27.4 per cent of GDP, the highest in four decades outside of COVID, and we've seen a $43 billion deterioration in the budget balance in a single year, with a decade of deficits to come. This budget does not help households. Australians have suffered the largest fall in living standards in the developed world under Labor, and Labor is offering you 70c a day in 15 months time, at the same time that it plans to take at least five times as much as this from you by growing tax on your income over the next decade. This budget does nothing to help business, to encourage investment or to address our national decline in productivity, and this budget does not address our urgent defence needs. At the same time we are being told we face the most dangerous and uncertain strategic environment in decades, we are spending as much on the NDIS as we are on our entire Defence Force. Labor's fiscal plan is setting us up for a wasted decade. They have no ambition for Australia. Their sole ambition is for themselves: to retain power whilst presiding over a continued national decline. This is no future for Australia.

We don't complain, but we do expect to get our fair share. After a decade of being ignored by the LNP, I'm really pleased to say that this budget is delivering for Queenslanders. In fact, we expect Queensland's funding to grow by $42.5 billion in 2028-29, and the budget revealed that we will be delivering $37.6 billion to Queensland in the next financial year.  What that means for Queenslanders is that every single taxpayer will receive a new tax cut. When you combine that with Labor's first round of tax cuts, the average benefit for Queensland taxpayers will be $2,494. Of course, Queenslanders will still receive savings from our cheaper medicines policy. Queenslanders are set to save $44 million with our cheaper medicines policy to reduce scripts down to $25. When it comes to students, students will be saving on their HELP debt, because we know that Queensland students will have an estimated $3.3 billion wiped from their loans—an average reduction of $5,357. We're also going to be opening 10 additional Medicare urgent-care clinics, including in Cairns North and across regional Queensland. Importantly, we're also making the investments we need in infrastructure. Last night's budget delivered $7.2 billion to finally fix the Bruce, $225 million for the Barron River bridge, $200 million for the Rockhampton Ring Road, and $70 million for the Kennedy Developmental Road. And, of course, we've secured $87.5 million to support the Cairns Water Security Project.

This is the system built by the old parties for the billionaires and the big corporations. They gutted public services, privatised government businesses for their corporate mates, slashed taxes for the rich, let banks run wild and let landlords run amok. The rich got richer and the old parties told the rest of Australia to be patient. Well, the Greens have had a gutful. We're calling time on this.

This course was built in partnership with MND organisations, clinicians, researchers and most importantly people with lived experience. That includes their families and their carers. Their insights and voices are central to this course, and that's what makes it so powerful. It covers the science of the disease, the impact it has on individuals and families, and the practical approaches to providing the best care and support. It's an incredible resource designed to be accessible, clear and compassionate.  I was proud to be part of this launch in my role as co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of MND. Every day in Australia, two people are diagnosed with MND. It's an horrific disease that changes lives in an instant. We must do everything we can to improve support, increase awareness and back the research needed to find a cure. Education is a critical part of that effort, and this MOOC will help make a real difference. I encourage all Australians—health professionals, students, carers and community members—to explore the course. You can access it through the UTAS website.

In less than a generation, Labor and the coalition have effectively borrowed more than $1 trillion to fund their reckless spending. By 2006, the Howard government managed to virtually wipe out the debt accumulated under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. Here we are 19 years later, and the Australian government's gross debt is now over $1 trillion. That's a one followed by 12 zeros, a thousand times a billion or a million times a million. It's more than 35 per cent of Australia's GDP.  Net debt costs Australia $27 billion a year in interest payments, while our total debt across the entire government sector costs us almost $50 billion a year in interest. It doesn't stop there. In the next three years, across the forward estimates, this gross debt is projected to grow by another $200 billion. If you ran your household this way, you'd lose your house. If you ran your business this way, you'd lose your business. You have to ask yourselves why you keep voting for them. Labor is robbing our great-grandchildren in a desperate bid to stay in power so they can heap another three years of misery and pain on the Australian people. One Nation has identified $90 billion in wasteful spending that could be slashed from the budget. This will liberate the resources needed to provide genuine cost-of-living and tax relief totalling $40 billion to pay down our growing debt and invest in nation-building infrastructure for Australia's future prosperity. Everything this government has touched has failed: climate change, the Voice, the housing scheme, immigration, the cost of living, economic stability and reform, and national security. Enough is enough. My message to the Australian people is: boot out this government with their Greens supporters, because they're the ones that are destroying this country, our standard of living and our way of life.

That can impact things like bees. I know the beekeeping community is very worried about this. I urge the Queensland state government to stay focused. I know there are places south of Brisbane, around Logan and places like that, where there are an enormous number of identified fire ant nests.

The previous coalition government let the Moss review collect dust while whistleblowers like Bernard Collaery faced relentless prosecution. It was, to their credit, a refreshing change when the current government dropped the charges against Collaery and promised to act on the Moss review's recommendations. But what followed? Days passed, days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months.  As months turned into years, the government chose to continue prosecuting more cases. David McBride, who exposed war crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison last year. Richard Boyle, who blew the whistle on improper debt recovery tactics by the ATO—tactics that the ATO was later forced to stop—will stand trial later this year. The Attorney-General released a discussion paper on whistleblower reform in November 2023. Since then—silence. Nothing. This has utterly fallen off the government's agenda. It's not so for the crossbench, who have introduced here and in the other place the whistleblower protection authority bills. These would establish a strong, independent body that not only protects whistleblowers but actively supports them in disclosing wrongdoing. Whistleblowers are essential to our democracy. Their insider knowledge can expose the very misconduct that reviews and inquiries fail to uncover. And yet, just like with banning gambling ads, legislating truth in political advertising or strengthening our climate targets, the government continues to ignore private members' bills, even when there is majority support in both houses.

It is a unique place and a budding tourism hub, home to many Territorians who love country and fight fiercely to protect their beautiful, sacred and precious places. The current government, and successive governments in the Top End, are consistently disregarding the community's self-determination and, in fact, ignoring a lot of the science. Last week the NT's CLP government rammed through the Territory Coordinator Bill, which overrides 32 statutes relevant to any project they consider economically significant. I want to be crystal clear: this green-lights an unelected bureaucrat who will be Australia's Elon Musk. They will facilitate projects for fracking, carbon dumping and cotton expansion, all with no oversight, community input or environmental assessment, which basically equals disaster. You couldn't even put lipstick on that pig of a bill.  The coordinator has powers to fast-track regulatory processes and prioritise approvals almost at will. Mobs from the gulf and Roper regions have told me of the issues they see in these ramped-up projects, which need urgent regulatory oversight for water and for country. The Northern Territory desperately needs renewable energy, yet this is being sidelined in favour of these climate- and environment-wrecking projects without any accountability or oversight. The fact that the Northern Territory government chose a gas executive to be the interim coordinator while the bill made its way through the parliament says absolutely everything we need to know. Federal Labor must now publicly condemn this bill and urgently commit to federal environmental protections to safeguard the unique and sacred biodiversity and the cultural heritage that exist in the Northern Territory.

If you missed it, they have been running a campaign: 'This weekend, have an awkward conversation.' It's all about having the conversation we never have or put off until it's too late, to let our loved ones know what we'd like to happen if the very worst takes place and we can't communicate.  Gill Savell, an advocate for palliative care, summed it up perfectly: Death doesn't discriminate, and it doesn't make appointments. A sudden stroke or dementia could steal someone's ability to communicate their wishes and make decisions. This is something that's really close to my heart. My mum passed away from health issues at 51 years old. I remember being with her when she passed, but we didn't get to have the conversation—and I truly wish we had. It was a really difficult time for me and my family, and it was so much harder because we hadn't talked about her final wishes. As I'm getting older, I've had to think about what matters to me and share my wishes with my family, if I can't speak or respond—although I have to be careful, as they might quite like it if I don't say a word at all! This weekend I'm going to encourage my family and friends to do the same—to be like me and make a start, no matter how difficult it might be. If you're still unsure, Palliative Care Tasmania has an 'awkward conversation' website with everything you need to get started, with lots of information, advice and support. We must have that awkward conversation with our families about what we want if the worst should happen. The last thing I want is for my family to be left in the same position I was when my mum died.

We know cost-of-living pressures drive the theft of basics, but instead of receiving support, people, including children as young as 10, are caged and abused. Lack of bail access is the biggest driver of First Nations overincarceration, particularly for women. There are more women are in prison awaiting trial than those convicted, mostly for non-violent offences that wouldn't result in jail time. Thousands are locked up without ever being found guilty. I've called on the Attorney-General, the Treasurer and the Minister for Indigenous Australians for urgent national investment in therapeutic bail support. They also have an open letter from the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, co-signed by 91 Aboriginal organisations and legal services, demanding action. Bail reduces remand populations, keeps families together and supports rehabilitation and community safety.

Western Australia has been short-changed by this government, and Tangney has been completely ignored.  Since I've mentioned Tangney and infrastructure, you probably know exactly where I'm heading, and that is, of course, the Shelley Bridge.

And, right now, thousands of cars and trucks are squeezed into just two lanes on the Shelley Bridge, creating delays, rat runs and safety risks. It's a daily challenge for thousands of residents, commuters, parents on their school runs and students heading to Curtin University. The failure of the state and federal Labor governments to deliver Roe 8 and Roe 9 has only made this worse. We need alternative solutions, and widening Shelley Bridge is one of the best options. Howard Ong is currently running a petition to gain community support for the widening of Shelley Bridge, and I encourage everyone to sign it. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peter Dutton, visited Shelley Bridge to see the congestion and the delays firsthand and to listen directly to the residents who are experiencing the daily frustrations of this vital transport link. Mr Dutton is committed to leading a government that listens to communities and delivers the infrastructure that they need so that people can get home faster and more safely. Howard Ong is the only candidate in Tangney fighting for the widening of Shelley Bridge, and only a Dutton led government can be trusted to deliver vital projects like this.

We will be delivering an additional 50 Medicare urgent care clinics, including three in my home state of South Australia, with one in the electorate of Sturt, which our candidate, Claire Clutterham, has been fighting tirelessly to deliver. And, for the women of Australia, we are delivering $793 million worth of investments into their health, because the women of Australia are sick of having their pain dismissed, they are sick to death of having their experiences minimised and they are sick of paying a tax on their health care which isn't shared by the rest of the population simply because they are women. We are adding contraceptive pills like Yasmin, YAZ and Slinda to the PBS for the first time in decades. We are funding endometriosis and IVF treatments, putting MHT on the PBS and taking women's health seriously, as it deserves to be taken. In contrast, Peter Dutton was voted the worst health minister on record by the doctors themselves. He tried to cut billions of dollars out of Medicare once; he'll try it again. When he cuts, you pay. We cannot trust the Liberals when it comes to Medicare.

Our responsible budget helps Australians now and builds Australians' future by delivering cost-of-living relief, a new tax cut for every taxpayer, energy bill relief for every household, and cheaper medicines, and by backing in higher wages. We're also strengthening Medicare with more bulk-billing and more urgent care clinics. We're making it easier to buy and rent a home, with an expansion of our Help to Buy scheme, and we're training more construction workers. We're investing in every single stage of education—I know that's something that those on this side have campaigned for, in many instances, including from Senator Walsh's point of view, for careers—including a 20 per cent cut to student debt. We're putting all public schools in Australia on a path to fair and full funding and we're investing in early education and care. We're building a stronger economy, with $3 billion for green metals. There are competition reforms, supports for small businesses and infrastructure investments. We're providing relief and investing in the future while delivering the biggest single improvement to the bottom line in one parliamentary term. I know you don't like that, but they are the facts. The measures in this budget combined with the cost-of-living relief we have delivered for Australians over the life of this parliamentary term will make a meaningful difference to households. On this side of the parliament we have understood that the government should respond when people are doing it tough and find ways to help households. Despite those opposite consistently voting against cost-of-living relief for Australians, we have taken every opportunity to help out Australian families with the pressure when they're facing it.

You see, the Liberals won't tell Australians what essential services they'll cut but they have made it crystal clear they're not going to cut Australian taxes.  It's incredible how quick Mr Taylor was to jump out of the gates to say no. In one of his recent disastrous interviews, the shadow Treasurer managed to say no to supporting everything, including his own leader. I would have thought it would be easy for him to rule out he was gunning for the leadership. He can say no to tax cuts for hardworking Australians but can't say no to a promotion. And now the Liberals are telling the media the message is, 'Leave him alone.' Leave poor Mr Taylor alone. Maybe he needs space for a clear run. Australians can't risk a Liberal government, whether it's led by Mr Dutton or Mr Taylor. They'll cut everything but your taxes.

That is the reality that Australian families are living.

When we came to government in 2022 it had never been harder or more expensive to find a doctor. Bulk-billing was in freefall after a decade of cuts and neglect to Medicare, and that's why strengthening Medicare was a key focus of our election platform. In just three years, we have delivered more doctors, more bulk-billing, cheaper medicines and opened 87 Medicare urgent care clinics, including one in Darwin. There are actually nine in the Northern Territory.  At this election Australia faces a choice of a stronger Medicare with more bulk-billing for all Australians under Labor or more cuts to Medicare under Peter Dutton's Liberals. A re-elected Albanese Labor government will make the single largest investment in Medicare since its creation over 40 years ago. We're investing $7.9 billion so all Australians can see a GP for free. Australian patients and families will save hundreds of dollars a year in out-of-pocket costs, and, for the first time, Labor will expand bulk-billing incentives to all Australians and create an additional new incentive payment for practices that bulk-bill every patient. Seeing a GP regularly helps to catch health issues early before they worsen and escalate to needing more intensive and more costly care.

Australia has a serious tax leakage problem regarding profits and labour sent offshore that are taxed at a much lower rate than profits and labour retained in this country. Australian domiciled businesses struggle to compete with foreign multinationals because of this, resulting in significant erosion of the tax base and our capital reserves. Last night's budget has revealed serious structural issues that need to be addressed urgently, with deficits forecast to occur out to 2035-36.

We spend about $70 billion a year through Commonwealth programs, and one of the issues we've had is how you define an Australian business. In the past, it's just been by an ABN. Australian businesses say to us that is not adequate to say you're an Australian business working here with Australian workers. We've done that, and we've looked at ways to strengthen the procurement guidelines to ensure that, particularly, small businesses get a fair share. I think we'll continue to look at ways to level the playing field, particularly in the way that we purchase services and programs, as a way of making sure that Australian businesses get a fair deal, and we constantly look at ways to ensure the integrity of the tax system, particularly as it relates to the issues you raise around tax leakage and multinationals' tax avoidance.

Budgets, obviously, are different in terms of the role that they have to play in the economy. When there is a need for government to lean in, as we saw during economic shocks, the budget is used as a way of leaning in, particularly when private investment withdraws. What we've seen, in welcome ways, is that private-sector investment is returning post the inflation shock that we've just been through, and that is good. That means we can continue to repair the fiscal buffers over time. But a budget also has to provide services and supports to the community. We have to balance up the range of pressures that are on the budget but repair it over time. That's what we've done in the last three years, and that's what we'd do if we were re-elected.

You are right: our No. 1 focus is making life easier for Australians by helping with the cost of living. Over this term we have prioritised acting on energy prices, with two rounds of energy bill relief and our steps to cap gas and energy prices. It is complemented, as you know, by action in the long term to implement our plan for reliable renewables. I'm pleased to advise the chamber that the Albanese Labor government will provide another $150 in energy bill relief, extending our energy rebate until the end of 2025.  Now, this responsible cost-of-living measure will help every household and will help small businesses as well. From 1 July 2025 every household and around one million small businesses will see further rebates, on top of the previous rebates that have already been rolled out to Australian households and small businesses. Treasury estimates that this will directly reduce headline inflation by about half a percentage point in 2025 and reduce household bills by 7.5 per cent on average nationally compared to bills without the extension. It builds on the practical and meaningful steps that we've taken to assist households with cost of living over the term—action that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, has stood against on every possible occasion. We know that under Mr Dutton and under Mr Taylor Australians will be worse off. We know, because they have shown us through their actions—not just by opposing energy price relief but also by opposing cost-of-living measures across the board. They are now opposing, unbelievably, Labor's tax cuts for every taxpayer—not once but twice. It is clear that Mr Dutton will cut everything but your tax.

My view of the definition of 'insanity' is—when they were in power, those opposite did nothing on housing for a decade. That's what I think. It's not only insanity but a complete abrogation of responsibility. They didn't have a housing minister for most of it, didn't do anything about supportive housing, didn't do anything about affordable housing and didn't do anything to provide the housing stock that this country needs.  They did absolutely nothing, and then worse, once they're in opposition, once they've been booted out because they failed to deal with a whole range of policy areas including housing, they systematically vote against everything we are trying to do to improve the housing supply in this country—every single time. They not only voted to oppose it but voted to delay it. Then, once they'd delayed it, they criticised the fact that it's not building enough houses. This is the sort of incoherent and irresponsible approach from those opposite, and this is a real indication of how they would behave if they were elected into government. This is what we are seeing—these kinds of student union questions from Senator Bragg, as opposed to serious engagement on an issue like housing, which is a serious issue that most people care deeply about. We have $33 billion on the table. We are building thousands of houses right now. They are under construction all around the country—no thanks to you, because you've opposed this every single step of the way. Where we have proposed sensible policies, you have sat back and opposed them, you've criticised them, you've delayed them and you've complained about them, and then, when it hasn't built the houses, you criticise that as well.

If you want to quote economists, have a look at what most of them say about that policy: that it's insanity, not only because of the burden on the age pension but because of the fact that you would singlehandedly reduce young people's superannuation savings and inflate house prices at the same time.

For three years, the Albanese Labor government's focus has been on growing wages and addressing cost-of-living pressures. Last night's budget shows that real wages will continue to grow alongside more new jobs, low unemployment and low inflation, and our budget locks in a further tax cut for every Australian taxpayer.  In an extraordinary development, we've now seen Mr Dutton and the coalition oppose those tax cuts. After months of Mr Dutton promising cuts so he can pay for $600 billion worth of nuclear reactors, we've finally found the only thing that Mr Dutton and the coalition won't cut, and that is your taxes. So we have the supposed party of lower taxes now opposing a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. The mental gymnastics we've seen on display from Senator Hume and Mr Taylor have been something to behold. Even the coalition's preferred broadcaster, Sky News, today asked Senator Hume, 'So, you're going to vote against these tax cuts but still claim to be the party of lower taxes?' Try to square that circle. Senator Hume, I wasn't able to do that. It does explain, though, all the coalition's leaking against their economic team, because I'd be pretty nervous about them too. But at least there are a few people on the coalition side who are willing to be honest, like the coalition MP who described Angus Taylor's Insiders performance as 'very strange'. And who could forget the No. 1 ticketholder of the Angus Taylor fan club, Senator Hughes, saying Mr Taylor needs to 'show some maturity and get across the detail'. No wonder Mr Taylor has a hit list of people he wants to target if he becomes the opposition leader after the election. That's right! We are now in a situation where those opposite are so busy thinking of things they can cut that they want to cut each other from being members of their party room. The only thing that Peter Dutton won't cut is your taxes, and Australians are about to have their say.

That doesn't happen often. I move:  That:  the Senate notes that:  the 2025-26 Budget does not contain any substantial support for small business, and  the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Incentives and Integrity) Bill 2025 presents an opportunity to legislate a $30,000 instant asset write off to give small businesses the certainty they deserve;  the order of the Senate agreed to earlier today relating to the hours of meeting and routine of business be further varied, to insert, at the end of the list of bills in paragraph (b) (ii), the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Incentives and Integrity) Bill 2025; and  a message be sent to the House of Representatives requesting that the House immediately consider the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Incentives and Integrity) Bill 2025. Unfortunately, we've seen this government repeatedly ignore small business when it comes to consultation on legislation, when it comes to digitisation to unlock productivity, when it comes to many of Bruce Billson's sensible recommendations for small business in this country. Here we are on the last day of the parliament, and the government is prioritising all sorts of bills. One they aren't prioritising is the instant asset write-off for this year, which hasn't even passed the House yet. Yet earlier, when he was asked about it, we saw the Treasurer blame the Senate. Blaming the Senate for a bill that hasn't passed the House yet seems like a very strange excuse from the government. I urge the major parties: rather than trying to score political points, let's pass these measures for Australia's 2½ million small businesses. They need the certainty, and this parliament has not adequately looked after small businesses in this parliament. We've heard, rightly, lots about cost-of-living pressures, but the thing we don't talk about is that small-business owners face a double whammy when it comes to cost of living. In their business they are dealing with rising costs and, in many instances, trying to work out ways to not pass them on to customers, and then at home they're facing the same cost-of-living pressures that all Australians are. This instant asset write-off is something that needs to be done today. It needs to be done today to allow small business to have certainty, and I urge the coalition to support it. We may see some squirming, some pushing for a higher amount and to make it permanent. I agree with both of those things. Last time this bill went through, I actually moved amendments to it, and we saw the coalition abstain. I'm not too sure why. But I urge the parliament to pass it. It's in the budget. It's something that the government has committed to. Let's get this $20,000 for this year done, and the next parliament will need to do the work of making it permanent, providing certainty and raising it to at least $30,000. I'll be moving an amendment to the TLAB—the more cost-of-living relief bill—to make sure that the instant asset write-off is legislated for this financial year. I urge all senators to think about the small businesses in their states and territories and support the amendment.","Consideration of Legislation","BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DAVID POCOCK (Australian Capital Territory) ","(15:14):","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","1","0","363","Senator HUME","266499","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Thank you very much, Senator Pocock, for moving this motion. The coalition will be supporting you in your effort to move this motion. The instant asset write-off is a fundamentally important feature of our taxation system, to drive productivity. Productivity has fallen to record lows under this government. Productivity is one of the great drivers of economic growth, which is so desperately needed in this environment. We've seen economic growth stagnate to around 0.8 per cent per annum. That is anaemic growth. Without productivity driving economic growth our prosperity is at risk.  The instant asset write-off is a fundamental tenet of our taxation system, particularly for small businesses. Small businesses rely on the instant asset write-off so that they can invest in the productive capacity of their own businesses and receive a full tax deduction for doing so. You will recall that the instant asset write-off has been used previously by governments in order to inject that productivity into our economy, back into economic growth. During COVID it went up to have a cap of around $100,000, from memory. That was a really important part of the coalition government's COVID response, to make sure that we kept businesses in business and kept people employed. At a time when the economy was at great risk, this was a fundamentally important measure. The instant asset write-off was continued under the Labor government, but we see that was removed from last night's budget entirely. The coalition have been pushing to not only keep this measure but raise it. We want to see the threshold raised from $20,000 to $30,000 to allow those small businesses who want to grow, to invest and to employ in their own businesses a tax deduction for investing in productive assets. I don't think that's too much to ask. Small businesses have been crying out for it, and last night they were devastated to see that it had been removed from the budget entirely. The coalition would like to see the write-off reinstated not just in this year's budget but in last year's. Let's face it: the problem is that because the House of Representatives hasn't passed this legislation—and it's in the House of Representatives, not in the Senate—thousands of small businesses have relied on the write-off being there at the end of this tax year. They've already made the investments, and they're expecting a tax deduction. But because this government has sat on it hands, because this government disrespects small businesses, those small-business owners are going to find themselves sorely disappointed unless Senator Pocock gets his way today and the House of Representatives stops sitting on its hands, passes this incredibly important measure and sends it here for the Senate to support. Small businesses need this. Small businesses not only need the instant asset write-off this year; they need it next year as well—and it has gone from this budget. We want to see the instant asset write-off threshold lifted from $20,000 to $30,000. Most importantly, a coalition government will commit to making the instant asset write-off a permanent feature of the taxation system. Why is this important? Because small businesses aren't like large businesses. They don't have the capacity to just make investments at the drop of a hat. They need to plan for it. They need to budget for it. And, when they do, they deserve to be rewarded for it. They deserve to make a tax deduction for those investments. Let's say you're a restaurant, a hospitality business. We know that one in 11 hospitality businesses failed last year, along with 29,000 other businesses that have failed under the Labor government. If you are a hospitality business and you want to invest in a new refrigeration system that's going to be more environmentally friendly and bring your electricity prices down, that would be fantastic. But you should be able to invest in that asset and then write it off immediately. Under a coalition government, that will always be the case. Unfortunately, under a Labor government that disrespects small businesses and doesn't understand small businesses—and you know why they don't understand small businesses? Because they have never worked in one, because they have never owned one, because they have never run one. The Labor government disrespect small businesses, so they will never approve an instant asset write-off. They don't think this is necessary. They would rather give people an election bribe of 70c a day in 18 months time in order to win an election. That's not taxation policy. That's not taxation reform. That's not productivity enhancing. That's an election sweetener. That's a budget measure for the next five weeks. That's not for the next five years. That's not for the next 50 years. That's simply a bribe. It's a cruel hoax to ordinary Australians who deserve so much better. The Labor Party think they can buy your vote. How dare they! Australians are not that stupid—and the small-business community certainly know that. One of the hats I've been wearing in this term of parliament is that of the chair of the Senate Select Committee on the Cost of Living, and one of the most heartbreaking stories I heard was that of a small-business owner in Western Australia. Western Australia is a pretty prosperous state, don't get me wrong. This man was 67 years old and he was sitting in a forum that I was running. He spoke at the very end of the forum and said: 'Under this government, I have seen my business go backwards. I have been running a hairdressing salon for 45 years. Me and my wife, together, have been running this salon. At our peak, we employed eight people, but we're down to four. I saw my business manager the other day. My business manager said to me—and I'm 67 years old—that I have $2,000 a month for my wife and I to live on for the foreseeable future, and that's it—$2,000 a month. Otherwise my business will go under and we will die paupers.' He has $2,000 a month, and, as he told me this story in front of about 40 people, he burst into tears. It was possibly the most moving and confronting moment that I have had throughout this term of government, because that's the face of failed Labor tax policy. That's the face of Labor's cost-of-living crisis. That's the face of Labor's cost-of-doing-business crisis. This poor man was facing poverty after years of doing what was right—running a business, employing other people, investing in his business and growing his business. It's small-business owners like that man that are the ones that we are standing up for here. On my side of the chamber, we stand up for small business. We know that the country can't run without small businesses. We know that communities falter without strong small businesses. We know unemployment goes up without small businesses. We need small businesses for economic growth and for our economic prosperity—prosperity for the nation for the next generation. This government does not understand small business, and that is why it has not legislated for an instant asset write-off for this financial year, let alone the next financial year. They have sat on their hands and allowed small businesses to make investment decisions thinking they were going to get a tax deduction for them, and now small businesses have found out that, because they're at the end of the runway, they're not. Well, that's just outrageous. That is a failure of a promise. That is a broken promise. So we will support Senator Pocock's motion. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Incentives and Integrity) Bill 2025, which is the bill that Senator Pocock would like to see pass the House of Representatives and come back to the Senate, is, for the most part, a bill that is in fact antibusiness. We tried to amend it because there were so many schedules to it that we did not agree with. They embedded the instant asset write-off in this bill, hoping that they could get through a whole series of antibusiness measures along with a pro-business measure. That's what this government does. It does it every single time. It tries to find a wedge so that it can get its antibusiness, antigrowth, antiproductivity, antiprosperity agenda through at the same time as those items that we want to see go through so that we can see growth in the economy and inject productivity into all that we do. I have colleagues who will go through the individual schedules, which include things like luxury car taxes and denying deductions for ATO interest charges, which is a terrible impost on small businesses. It also extends the period to retain a BAS refund. But schedule 4 is the one that is most important, because this is Labor's attempt to chip away at the instant asset write-off with this limit of $20,000, which is completely inadequate and which the coalition has said it would like to see extended to $30,000. But that's just this financial year, and small business have been waiting for and relying on this. Next financial year, when this terrible Labor budget kicks in—when that $42 billion of deficit and the trillion dollars of Labor debt kick in—there will be no instant asset write-off, because Labor don't care about small business. Labor don't care about small business, because they don't understand small business. So not only do we want to see this pass but we want to see this budget rejected. We want to see an instant asset write-off that goes up to $30,000 and is made a permanent feature of the taxation system. Why do we want to do that? Because small businesses, for three years now, have been crying out for help. They've watched their electricity bills go up by 32 per cent. They've watched their gas bills go up by 34 per cent. They've watched their rents go up. They've watched their wage bills go up. They've watched their superannuation bills go up. And they're caught in the pincer movement because they're also at the other end of the cost-of-living crisis. So many businesses have seen demand for their products and services drop away, as consumer demand has dried up after 12 interest rate rises under Labor. Those 12 interest rate rises, I might add, all occurred while these guys were wearing 'yes' T-shirts and wandering around the country telling people to change the Constitution. That happened on their watch because they took their eye off the ball. Labor took their eye off the ball, and their misplaced priorities and poor policies have meant that Australians have suffered under Labor. If you want to know why your standard of living has gone backwards by eight per cent, if you want to know why you are poorer, if you want to know why you've spent an additional $50,000 on your mortgage over the last three years—$50,000 that you will never get back—look no further because they're sitting across the chamber. They were out there campaigning in 'yes' T-shirts while interest rates went up. While electricity prices went up, they said, 'Oh, no, the best thing would be a renewables-only approach.' They forgot to say $275. They haven't said that for three years now. They said 97 times before the last election that they were going to bring power prices down by $275. Have they said it once since the election? No. They're pretty big on subsidies. They're pretty big on giving you your own money back to compensate for their failed policies. It doesn't matter if it's in health. It doesn't matter if it's in energy. They're happy to give you your money back because their policies don't work out. The instant asset write-off is a fundamental feature of our taxation system. It has worked for years to increase productivity, economic growth and prosperity—prosperity that all Australians expect and deserve from a government that understands fiscal responsibility and economic management. But, unfortunately, that's not what we've seen this week. It's certainly not what we've seen today. What we've seen this week is a budget that's willing to squander two windfall surpluses and instead return a $42 billion deficit and a budget that's willing to rack up debt to the tune of a trillion dollars that your kids and your grandkids are all going to pay for for generations to come. But they've also said they're willing to buy your vote back. They're willing to buy your vote back for 70c a day, which you won't get for another 18 months. How about them apples? Isn't that extraordinary? They think that you are so stupid that you would fall for something as shallow and as brazen as an election bribe of 70c a day. Bring back the instant asset write-off. Bring it back to this parliament, bring it back to this chamber and let's pass it right now. But let's not just pass it at a $20,000 threshold; let's raise it to $30,000. Let's do small business a favour finally because they've been crying out for help and they'll never find it from the Albanese government.

Twelve months ago, Jim Chalmers, we thought, started work on this year's budget, which was delivered last night. The budget is delivered in the House of Representatives every May every year. Jim Chalmers, as the Treasurer, had 12 months to prepare for last night's budget—12 months to think how Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and he, Treasurer Jim Chalmers, and indeed Labor senators would respond to the cost-of-living crisis that is crippling our economy, as well as mortgage stress, which is crippling the experiences and the savings of Australian families, and indeed how they would respond to the 27,000 business insolvencies that have taken place under almost three years of Labor. And when thinking about how he would respond to this disastrous set of economic experiences being felt by people in their homes and by small-business owners, Labor's response was: 70c a day, sometime next year. That is the depth of care and consideration that this Labor government has put into the issues of falling living standards and falling productivity levels. That is the extent of Jim Chalmers's creative thinking. That is the extent of Anthony Albanese's economic experience: 70c a day, to be delivered sometime next year. Senator Hume's contribution a moment ago was absolutely right: this is an election bribe. It does nothing to tackle tax reform in this country. It does nothing to tackle the productivity challenge we face in this country. And of course it does nothing to tackle the collapse in living standards that Australians have experienced and will continue to experience for years ahead of them. It is not a budget that delivers even the closest resemblance to anything that can be described as sound or responsible economic management, and it certainly is not a plan that tells Australian families and Australian businesses that their standard of living is on the way up instead of on the way down. Labor's fourth budget is a plan they hope will get them across the line on 3 May, 10 May or 17 May. It is most definitely not a plan about how this country can keep its head above water for the next three years and for the next 10 years. It's a shameful exercise by Labor, on the eve of the election, to try to hoodwink Australian voters into thinking that a vote for Labor is a vote for the future. A vote for Labor is a vote for Jim Chalmers's future; there's no doubt about that. A vote for Labor might actually be a vote for Anthony Albanese's short-term future; there's no doubt about that. But it is absolutely not a vote that anyone should be handing to Labor if they care about the future direction of this country. In just three short years—well, three long years, if you've been a mortgage holder suffering mortgage stress or if you've been a small business that's been forced into insolvency—Labor has ruined the country and has ruined the economy. You don't have to believe me; you just have to look at the data. The OECD says Australian living standards have slipped. Regulators say small business insolvencies have peaked at 27,000, and more are expected. The RBA provided data to me just last week saying that mortgage stress in this country is up. People should not risk their vote at this election on Labor.

To give a couple of examples, every single cost-of-living relief measure that we've brought into this place, whether it be cheaper medicines or tax cuts, they've opposed. But they've got the cheek to come in here and ask us what we're doing for cost-of-living relief. They've opposed every single one of those measures.  As to being asked about jobs, the Labor Party is the party of the worker. We've created one million new jobs in our term of government, the most of any first-term government. We absolutely back Australian workers. We've done that. We've got wages moving again. We've done that while we've kept unemployment low, and we're also getting inflation under control. You'd think that it might be of interest to those opposite, actually, to help us with all those things—to help the Australian economy and Australian workers. But, every time, they've sat on that side of the chamber and voted against every single thing that we've done to support Australian households, and they come in here with the cheek to ask us what it is that we're doing when they know, because they sat on that side and voted against it every single time. It is completely embarrassing for you, actually. In the meantime, the Albanese Labor government is putting money back in the pockets of Australians who are making the run to the supermarket or the petrol station. We know that every dollar matters, and it should be back in your pocket. The cost of living is front of mind for every Australian right now. It's the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 issue. We in the Albanese Labor government know that. We know that no Australian should have to check their bank balance and decide between putting food on the table, sending their kid to school, seeing a doctor and putting petrol in the car. We don't want Australians to have to make that choice, and that's why our No. 1 priority is taking the pressure off Australian families through our responsible economic management and the cost-of-living relief we're providing to Australians. The budget you saw last night from Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher is another great example of what it is that we are doing as a government. The Albanese Labor government will deliver two more tax cuts to every Australian taxpayer in 2026 and 2027, taking the total to 50 bucks a week extra in your pocket. Those people over there are making fun of this, saying that it'll be five bucks. Well, five bucks actually gets you a loaf of bread and two litres of milk. That actually matters to families who are doing it tough.

I just checked on the Coles app. That's where I know I can get a loaf of bread and a two-litre bottle of milk. So $5 actually makes a difference when you're trying to put food in your kids' bellies, but you're over there making fun of it. Those extra dollars make a difference for Australian families, absolutely.  We know that Australians are still under pressure, and that pressure is being felt at the checkout, with the energy provider or at the doctor. Electricity prices went down by 25 per cent last year, but they're still putting pressure on households. We know that. Two rounds of energy rebates have helped take some of the sting out of energy costs. Three hundred dollars of energy bill relief for every Australian household is absolutely making a difference, and the next instalment of that is coming on 1 April for Australian households. We're also making sure that you can see a GP for free, with the single largest investment in Medicare since its creation over 40 years ago. We believe that the only card that you need to see a doctor should be your Medicare card, unlike those opposite, who think you should be pulling out your credit card. Those are not our values. They are absolutely not our values. We're also making medicines cheaper. When we came to government, the cost of a prescription was $42. We are going to cut that to $25, because we don't want you to have to choose between putting food on the table and taking care of your health.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","372","Senator SCARR","282997","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","As to the cost of a loaf of bread, I've just done some quick research. If you go onto a website called the Numbeo website, it indicates that a 500-gram loaf of fresh white bread is cheaper in Iceland, the US—including Puerto Rico—Switzerland, Norway, Costa Rica, Denmark, Luxembourg, Jamaica and South Korea than in Australia. I could go on. In dozens of countries, it is cheaper to buy a loaf of bread than it is in Australia. So don't come here and talk to us about the cost of a loaf of bread.  The previous speaker spoke about this as being 'another great example of what we are doing as a government'. That's how they described this budget. I say to the people of Australia: do just three things, if you want to assess this budget. Before you make a decision at the next election, please do these three things. First, the one page in the budget that you should have a look at is in Budget Paper No. 1, Budget strategy and outlook, table 3.2. What will you see there? Underlying cash deficit: $27.6 billion, 2024-25; $42.1 billion, 2025-26. Deficit: $35.7 billion, 2026-27; $37.2 billion, 2027-28; $36.8 billion, 2028-29. A sea of red ink is what you'll find in another great example of what this government's achieved. That's only looking at the underlying cash balance. It doesn't include off-balance sheet items, which—under some accounting sorcery—aren't included in that table but would add $104 billion to that deficit, taking you, over the forward estimates, to a total of $283.4 billion of deficits in this budget. That's the first thing you should do—look at table 3.2. The second thing you should do is read what economists are saying about this budget. I want to quote from an article written by Professor Richard Holden, a professor of economics at the University of New South Wales. This is what he says about the budget. These are his words, not the words of a politician on either side of this chamber. These are the words of an economist who's studied the budget. I'm quoting from an article in the Fin Review. This is how he describes it: Chalmers is wrong. The worst is not behind us, it is yet to come. Those are his words. In relation to the so-called tax cuts, this is what Professor Holden says: The government is stealing a $10 note from you and throwing back a $2 coin. That's how Professor Holden describes the 70c-a-day tax cuts in this budget. Why? Because of bracket creep. He says: A worker on $100,000 a year will get a $268 tax cut in the 2026-27 fiscal year and $536 each year after that. So $5000 over a decade. But the same worker will be hit by $25,000 in increased taxes from bracket creep … With increased taxes of $25,000 you'll get $5,000 back. This is the Labor Albanese government stealing a $10 note from you and throwing back a $2 coin. So the second thing you should do is read that article by Professor Holden. The last thing you should do is ask yourself: after three years of the Labor Albanese government, am I better off? If you are not better off—and we know, as Senator Hume referred to this, that net real disposable income has fallen by eight per cent over the term of this government—over the last three years, then why, in goodness sake, would you give this Labor government another three years? Why would you expect a different result? The millions of Australians who are doing it tough out there, should ask themselves this question: am I better off or worse off after three years of this Labor government?

"0","0","0","1","1","0","373","Senator DARMANIN","301128","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I'd also like to take note of the ridiculous assertion by Senator Hume earlier today that Australians are poorer because of Labor's failed policies. This could not be further from the truth. Since 2022, when we came into office, this government has been working every single day to bring responsible economic management to this country and ensure Australians are better off. Under Labor, inflation is down, incomes are strengthening, unemployment is very low, interest rates are coming down and now growth is rebounding solidly as well. We've got the budget in much better shape, with the biggest ever fiscal improvement in a parliamentary term—$207 billion better than what we inherited. In our first two years we delivered the first back-to-back surpluses in nearly two decades, and this year we've almost halved the deficit. We've lowered the Liberal debt that was left to us by $177 billion, saving $60 billion in interest costs over the next decade.  And this budget is keeping the reform wheels turning as well. We're boosting wages, boosting competition and boosting growth by banning non-competes for most workers, making sure that they can move to better, higher paying jobs. We recognise people are still under pressure and that's why our highest priority remains easing the cost of living for Australians. I want to talk a little bit more about non-competes. Far from contributing to poorer outcomes for Australians, this is an important reform close to the hearts of many Australian workers. The Albanese government is taking action to stop unfair non-compete clauses that are holding back Australian workers from switching to better, higher paying jobs. We will ban non-compete clauses for most workers when those clauses have no justification and drag down wages. The budget is backing workers, boosting wages and building a stronger economy. Reforming non-compete clauses is about encouraging aspiration, unlocking opportunity, lifting wages and making Australia's economy more dynamic and competitive. Right now, more than three million Australian workers are covered by these clauses, including early childhood educators, construction workers, disability support workers and hairdressers—some of whom have been taken to court by their employer for simply trying to change jobs and get a better life for themselves and their families. Research suggests that the reforms could lift wages of affected workers by up to four per cent, or about $2,500, per year for a worker on median wages. The Productivity Commission modelling suggests that these changes could improve productivity and add $5 billion, or 0.2 per cent, to GDP annually as well as reduce inflation. I want to move briefly to the impact of the budget on Victorians. Very soon Victorians, along with the rest of the country, will be heading to the polls, and as a Victorian senator I want to look at how Victorians will fare under this budget. Victoria will be a big beneficiary. Every taxpayer will receive tax cuts of up to $268 in the 2026-27 year and $537 in 2027-28. And despite what those opposites say, those are big amounts of money for some people. And, combined with the first round of tax cuts, average Victorian taxpayers will be $2,530 better off. Some comments were made about energy. Treasury estimates that this will directly reduce headline inflation by around half a percentage point in 2025—this is the additional energy rebates—and reduce household bills by 7½ per cent nationally, on average, when compared with going without the extension of the rebate. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has shown the energy rebates that the government has been rolling out with the states have directly reduced electricity prices. In 2024, they fell by 25.2 per cent but would have fallen by just 1.6 per cent without energy rebates. What this means for Victoria is that all 2.5 million households will get this $150 to help with their bills, along with 223,000 eligible small businesses. This government's energy bill relief payments to Victoria in 2025-26 are estimated to total $441.4 million. The divide could not be more glaring. Labor is building Australia's future; the coalition is blocking it.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","375","Senator FAWCETT","DYU","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Thank you. I had better speak a bit quicker then! In 2022 the Australian people decided to give the Albanese Labor government a chance. They trusted the promise made by Mr Albanese that life would be cheaper under his government. Well, how did that work out? We know food has gone up by 13 per cent, housing by 14 per cent, rent by 18 per cent, electricity by 32 per cent—excepting the one-off things that Labor has put in that they're calling 'cost-of-living support', which won't last for long—and gas by 34 per cent. In my home state of South Australia, we sometimes pay up to 45c per kilowatt hour, compared to places in the world where the cost is down around 13c per kilowatt hour. Experts around the world say that it will only get worse because of the policy direction of the Albanese government. When it comes to housing, the Albanese government promised 30,000 affordable homes. What have they delivered? Zero new homes have been built. As estimates highlighted, the few homes that have been delivered are actually repurposed existing housing stock, so that's another promise not delivered.  In contrast, the ACCC highlighted in December 2021, at the end of the coalition government's term, that there was an eight-year low in electricity prices under the coalition government and their policies. The coalition's policy going forward is in line with the OECD, the International Energy Agency and the expert economists and engineers of the world, who say that we can reduce the cost of power, increase the reliability of power and reduce emissions through including nuclear generation as part of our mix. The Australian people also trusted the Albanese government on defence. They trusted Mr Albanese when he said in March 2022 that he vowed to provide Defence with the resources it needs to protect Australia. Well, how did that work out? The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in their independent analysis, have highlighted that, despite the promises of funding in the future, in the actual three years of delivery of the Albanese government since they came to office in March 2022, funding in real terms has actually gone backwards by about $1½ billion. We see them robbing Peter to pay Paul across a whole range of projects, with some $83 billion worth of cuts across air, sea, land and space, which has decreased Australia's military capability. In four or five weeks time, the Australian people will once again get to go to the polls and decide on who they wish to have govern this country. As one of my colleagues, Senator Scarr, said just previously, one of the key questions people should be asking themselves is: are you better off than you were three years ago? The answer for the majority of Australians is no, and that's because the government have been distracted for almost half of their term by things like the divisive Voice campaign, which cost half a billion dollars that could have been far better spent; they've been fixated on an ideological approach to energy that is flying in the face of global experts on energy policy; and, most disturbingly, they have been delinquent in their responsibility to properly resource what both sides of politics acknowledge is the first priority of government—the defence of the nation. When you look at this budget, again, independent experts are saying that it is failing to respond to the real security threats that Australia is facing. The signature support that they're saying they'll give to Australian people is a cup of coffee a week in 18 months time. That's not helping families dealing with grocery bills, rent bills, housing stress and rent pressures today, nor is it investing in Australian industry, despite the promises of a future made in Australia. What the defence industry tell me on a frequent basis is that they see the funding going offshore to international primes, in the main, for capabilities that won't be delivered for another five to 10 years. Australian jobs are disappearing or being put at risk, and the future is not being made in Australia. So, when Australians go to the polls in a few weeks time, they should ask themselves: are you better off than you were three years ago? Do you want a government that's distracted, delinquent and fixated on its ideology, or do you want a government that has a good track record and plans that align with international best practice in engineering and economics? Australia needs a Dutton government to get back on track. Question agreed to.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","377","Senator WATERS","192970","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I move:  That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Emergency Management (Senator McAllister) to a question without notice asked by Senator Hanson-Young today relating to environmental laws. I came into this parliament as an environmental lawyer, and one of my main drivers in seeking election was to try to strengthen our environmental laws to better protect nature and give voice to communities who also want to protect nature. It turns out that's a whole lot harder than you might think. Imagine my surprise to discover that, in fact, both big parties don't want to strengthen our environmental laws, because they're both in the pockets of the mining companies, the logging companies, the forestry operators—big industrial complexes. Imagine my horror to discover that it is harder than you think to have laws that protect the wondrous biodiversity and nature that our very survival depends on. The Prime Minister made a promise that, in this term of government, his government would strengthen our environmental laws—it would have an independent watchdog and it'd fix some other longstanding flaws in the EPBC Act. Apart from one tiny change which expanded out the water trigger to include shale gas and tight gas—at the behest of the Greens and with our votes to deliver it—we haven't seen any strengthening at all. In fact, when we were on the verge of inking an arrangement with the Minister for the Environment and Water, the Prime Minister himself came in and cancelled that arrangement because he'd just gotten off the phone with the WA Premier, in the lead-up to their state election, who'd said that the big miners and the big loggers didn't want this bill, so the Prime Minister had to dump it—and so he did. Nature, once again, went to the back of the queue because politics trumped it. How base! How absolutely demoralising for anyone who expects better from parliament. Not only did we not get the strengthening of environmental laws that had been promised to the public as part of this party's election platform; now we see in the final week of parliament, on the very final day of this parliament, that, no, we're not prioritising making the GP free, we're not prioritising making TAFE free, they're not prioritising climate action or even getting dental into Medicare—all things that the Greens want to see. No. In fact, this government is prioritising doing a deal with the opposition to weaken our environmental laws to send an ancient species, of which there are no more than 120 left on the planet, to extinction to save a rotten industry. At risk are 22 people's jobs. The jobs of 22 people are worth more to the folk in this chamber than an entire species. Those people deserve help; it's not their fault that they work in a toxic industry. They could be receiving different kinds of help from the government, but, no, the Prime Minister has decided that he's going to wreck our already weak environmental laws to facilitate a toxic industry continuing to operate and send the maugean skate to extinction. That's the political calculus that he thinks is a good call. It's not just for the salmon industry. This change to our laws means that any change in circumstance, any new information that comes to the environment minister's desk, can't be considered. It cannot change the mind of the minister. This bill is fundamentally anti science, because it says that if you find out you are going to send a species to extinction or, wow, that that patch of habitat is the only bit that's left now after, perhaps, a bushfire destroyed the rest, tough luck—the minister won't be able to reconsider that decision. The minister will not be able to act to protect nature in that instance. This bill doesn't just affect the Tasmanian salmon and the future of the maugean skate; this is a blank cheque for any industry that wants to try and sneak out of our environmental laws. The message that it sends to any powerful industry is, 'If you're not happy with our environmental laws, if they're not weak enough already for you, you can just get on the blower to the Prime Minister, ask for a special loophole and, hey presto, the parliament will deliver that for you.' It sends the message that the big corporates are in charge of this building and that they are more important than the community or nature. The Greens will not stand for that. It's likely there'll be a minority government, and we will push the next government to actually protect nature and finally cancel the stranglehold that big corporates have over this so-called democracy.

Leave granted. The speech read as follows— I rise today in favour of the Liability for Climate Change Damage (Make the Polluters Pay) Bill 2025, an Australian Greens Bill that will make coal and gas corporations liable for the damage caused by climate disasters. The climate crisis is turbocharging extreme weather events and devastating local communities across the country, with locals in Northern Rivers and Queensland most recently bearing the brunt of more intense and severe storms and flooding. We know that coal and gas are fuelling these climate disasters, yet the major parties keep approving projects that fuel the fire. Fossil fuel corporations continue to profit while everyday people are paying with their homes, livelihoods and, in some cases, their lives. This Bill will give people and businesses affected by climate change fuelled events, such as victims of Tropical Cyclone Alfred, the right to sue coal and gas corporations to pay for the damage these corporations have caused. In Australia, regulators and lawyers have advised that companies and their directors may have climate-related risks that should be disclosed, including litigation risk. In other countries, fossil fuel companies have faced legal action for climate damage. This Bill will clarify the situation under Australian law. The Liability for Climate Change Damage (Make the Polluters Pay) Bill 2025 would allow victims of climate disasters, including people affected by Tropical Cyclone Alfred, to sue thermal coal, oil and gas companies for damages caused to their homes or businesses. Governments would also be able to take legal action in their own right or on behalf of people affected by climate disasters. Major emitters of greenhouse gases, including fossil fuel producers and owners or operators of coal-fired power stations, will be liable for climate change damage if their total emissions are greater than 1 million tonnes in any 12-month period that began on or after 1 September 1990. The first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was released in that year, unambiguously linking fossil fuels to global warming. From at least this time onwards, every fossil fuel corporation has known, or should have known, about the consequences of their actions. It has been widely acknowledged for a long time that climate change is making natural disasters worse. We cannot keep allowing those fuelling the fire to rake in profits while our communities are left behind to clean up the mess. Instead of continuing to approve new coal and gas, I urge the major parties to prioritise Australian communities on the frontline of the climate crisis and support this bill.","Liability for Climate Change Damage (Make the Polluters Pay) Bill 2025","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WATERS (Queensland—Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate) ","(16:08):","N/A"

I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill. Leave granted.  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.  Leave granted. The speech read as follows— Every person in Australia, regardless of sex or gender, is likely to experience reproductive health issues at some point throughout their working lives. Many of these health issues can take a serious physical and mental toll on workers and can inhibit their ability to work. While some people may simply want workplace flexibility, those who need leave to manage their reproductive health should be able to access it. This Bill will give every worker the right to 12 days of paid reproductive health leave per year. All employees will be able to access reproductive health leave. Much like paid family and domestic violence leave, this leave will be accessible to all workers, irrespective of their employment status: casual, part and full time employees. No one should have to suffer financially or jeopardise their employment to manage their reproductive health. Whether it's for perimenopause and menopause, fertility treatments, chronic conditions like endometriosis or preventative screening for breast, cervical or prostate cancer—it's about supporting workers at every stage of life. If someone wants to get a vasectomy or be with their partner for the first scan of their baby, they will be able to under this entitlement. This Bill delivers on Australian Unions' It's For Every Body campaign for paid reproductive health leave. It builds on Queensland's 10 days of paid reproductive health leave for workers in the Queensland Public Service, and Victoria's Public Service Agreement, which provides 5 days of paid reproductive health leave to Victorian Government employees. It also follows many employers in the private sector who have implemented reproductive health leave policies. Menopause is a natural life transition, yet for some women and people who menstruate, perimenopause and menopause symptoms can impact workforce participation. Ensuring access to flexible work arrangements, and providing leave where it is needed, are critical tools to ensure that all women and people who menstruate can continue to participate in the workforce for as long as they want. Evidence to the Senate inquiry into menopause and perimenopause was that many women are leaving the workforce earlier to deal with their symptoms, whereas allowing them to access leave or request flexible working arrangements could see them continue in the workforce longer. This Bill adds perimenopause and menopause as reasons an employee can request flexible working arrangements. This could look like the ability to start a bit later if you've had a rotten night's sleep or the right to work from home if you are having really heavy bleeding. Flexibility to manage perimenopause and menopause symptoms was one of the key calls from women, employers and unions who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry into menopause and perimenopause. The Bill also amends the Workplace Gender Equality (Matters in relation to Gender Equality Indicators) Instrument 2023 to allow for the collection of data on the supports employers are providing, and their usage, for employees experiencing menopause and perimenopause, including specific workplace policies. WGEA used to collect this data on a voluntary basis, before it was found to be beyond the scope of the Act's remit. This change would permit and require WGEA to recommence this data collection, which will help build an evidence base on the existing approaches to menopause and perimenopause across organisations and help to paint a picture of what's working. It is well over time to bring reproductive health issues out of the shadows and address the stigma. Paid reproductive health leave and expanded eligibility to flexible working arrangements will help do this. Let's make employment work for everyone and ensure that workers don't suffer financially or jeopardise their employment to manage their reproductive health. I commend the Bill to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.  Leave granted; debate adjourned.","Fair Work Amendment (Paid Reproductive Health Leave and Flexible Work Arrangements) Bill 2025","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WATERS (Queensland—Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate) ","(16:10):","N/A"

Leave granted.  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.  Leave granted. The speech read as follows— Today I commend this Bill to the Senate, a Bill to legislate against, and apply penalties to, the release of emissions that cause damage to First Nations rock art that has been recognised as culturally, historically, scientifically and archaeologically significant. Rock art that has this significance should be recognised as an important type of national monument. In fact, for our future generations and preservation of cultural heritage, we need to protect all of our important national monuments from corrosive emissions and destruction for the benefit of resource projects. Rock art is irreplaceable and priceless. It is the oldest surviving human art form. Across Australia rock art is an integral part of First Nations life and customs, dating back to the earliest times of human settlement on the continent. Researchers estimate that there are more than 100,000 significant rock art sites around Australia. More than 5,000 are located in the Northern Territory's Kakadu National Park alone. The first humans arrived in Australia between 65,000 and 80,000 years ago. Australian rock art has been dated to around 45,000 years ago, although there are possibly much older sites on the continent. All cultures use imagery to tell stories, so it is likely that, from the time of their first arrival in Australia, First Nations peoples were using artworks in sacred and public sites to give form to their narratives. For First Nations peoples in Australia, rock art sites are records of their ongoing history since time immemorial. Rock art consists of paintings, drawings, engravings, stencils, bas-relief carvings and figures made of beeswax in rock shelters and caves. It can take two main forms: engravings (petroglyphs) and paintings or drawings (pictographs). Petroglyphs are created by removing rock through pecking, hammering or abrading in order to leave a negative impression. Pictographs are made by applying pigments to the rock. Drawings use dry colours, such as charcoal, clay, chalk and ochre, which can be anything from pale yellow to dark reddish brown. Paintings use wet pigments made from minerals, which are applied by finger or with brushes made from chewed sticks or hair. Sometimes stencils are created by blowing the colour from someone's mouth over an outline. Broadly speaking, rock art in Australia employs two main design types. The first uses engraved geometric forms, such as circles, concentric circles, arcs, dots or animal tracks. The second creates figurative forms, such as painted or engraved silhouettes of humans or animals. These figures can be either simple outlines or more complex constructions. The X-ray pigment art of Kakadu, for example, shows the internal organs of humans and animals. Within these two main designs, however, infinite variations are possible, depending on the preferences of the individual artist or cultural groups. Petroglyphs are created on almost any stone surface, and examples of engraved art can be found across the continent. But examples of pictographs usually survive only in more sheltered areas, such as overhangs or caves. Owing to their connection to First Nations beliefs, many of these locations are considered sacred sites. First Nations peoples' knowledge of rock art is still vital and alive in Australia today. Stories about these artworks have been passed down, in some cases through thousands of generations, and in others directly from the artists themselves. Rock art is an invaluable spiritual, historic and artistic resource, but it raises various issues, primarily concerning how it can best be protected. In Australia, seven heritage places are on the National Heritage List, in recognition of their outstanding cultural significance to the nation: Dampier Archipelago, Grampians National Park, Kakadu National Park, Koonalda Cave, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, the Tasmanian Wilderness and the West Kimberley. All these sites have been given the highest protection under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. With the proper care and recognition of their cultural value, they will continue to be appreciated by generations of Australians to come, although it has to be pointed out, the EPBC Act doesn't currently prevent any project from being approved if the Minister thinks it can coexist with heritage. The biggest island in the Dampier Archipelago is Murujuga, which many of you will know as the Burrup Peninsula. In 1963 the island became an artificial peninsula when it was connected to the mainland by a causeway for a road and a railway. Murujuga means 'hip bone sticking out', and if you have a look at the shape of the land there, the name makes a lot of sense. Murujuga is unique. It contains the Murujuga Cultural Landscape, the world's largest and most important collection of petroglyphs. Some of the Aboriginal rock carvings have been dated to around 45,000 years old, making them some of the oldest known. The collection of standing stones there is the largest in Australia with rock art petroglyphs numbering over one million. Some of them depict the now extinct Tasmanian tiger. The Dampier Rock Art Precinct covers the entire archipelago, while the Murujuga National Park lies within Murujuga. It is estimated that around 900 sites, or 24 percent of the original rock art on Murujuga, was destroyed to make way for industrial development between 1963 and 2006. The historical, cultural and archaeological significance of the area has led to a campaign for its protection. The preservation of the Murujuga monument has been called for since 1969, and in 2002 the International Federation of Rock Art Organizations commenced a campaign to preserve the remaining monument. Murujuga has been listed in the National Trust of Australia Endangered Places Register and in the 2004, 2006, and 2008 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. In 1996, a land use plan by the Burrup Peninsula Management Advisory Board divided the region into two areas, a Conservation, Heritage and Recreation Area, spanning 5,400 hectares—62% of Murujuga—and an Industrial Area with an emphasis on port sites and strategic industry— 38% of Murujuga. While the plan commented upon 'the value of the Northern Burrup for the preservation of its renowned Aboriginal heritage and environmental values', no comment was made on the amount of rock art affected by development and recreational activities. According to the Philip Adams radio show on Radio National, one worker on an industrial site, an electrician for Woodside, claimed the company had crushed 10,000 petroglyphs for road fill, at a time of international outrage over the Taliban destruction of the Bamiyan buddhas. The oldest representation of a human face was destroyed. As of 2011, the area remained on the World Monument Fund's list of 100 Most Endangered Places in the World—the only such site in Australia—because of continued mismanagement of the heritage and conservation values of Murujuga. Murujuga has become the host for one of the gas industry's largest facilities, the Burrup Hub, and there are plans for extensive expansions. We are talking about one of the biggest oil and gas developments ever undertaken in Australia, by Woodside Petroleum and BHP, known as the Scarborough project, Scarborough being the name of the gas field 375 km off the Pilbara coast. The project includes a floating production unit, the drilling of 13 wells, and a 430 km pipeline to transport the gas to the onshore Pluto LNG processing facility near Karratha, which will be expanded. The existing facilities already burn the equivalent of the entire annual emissions of New Zealand, every day. Much of the rock art now lies inside the Murujuga National Park, and on 7 July 2008, the Australian Government placed 90% of the remaining rock art areas of the Dampier Archipelago on the National Heritage List. Campaigners pushed for the Australian Government to include all of the undisturbed areas of the Dampier Archipelago on the World Heritage List and, in January 2020, the Australian Government finally lodged a submission for the Murujuga cultural landscape to be included as an entry to the World Heritage Tentative List. But along with mechanical damage to the rock art from industrial land clearance for roads, pipelines, power lines, and other activities, Murujuga rock art has been damaged by industrial emissions. Without even considering the plumes that rise from the fertiliser and gas plants, acidic dust pollution can combine with water to form acids that dissolve manganese and iron compounds, causing the fragmentation of the rock varnish. Researchers have said that reducing the amount of dust stirred up by machinery is essential to protect the rock art for future generations. Then we have to consider the emissions that arise from fertiliser and LNG production itself. Airborne emissions from industrial activity that can degrade rock art and other monuments include nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ammonia and particulate matter. The existing facilities at the Burrup Hub produce all four of these pollutants, and the proposed expansions will fill the air above Murujuga with chemicals that react with water and air to produce acids and other corrosive materials. There are nine matters of national environmental significance under the EPBC Act, including, but not limited to, world heritage properties, national heritage places, Commonwealth marine areas and water resources. There is a policy gap in that emissions which cause damage to the surfaces of national and world heritage monuments are currently not considered a matter of national significance under the EPBC Act. The Bill seeks to address this deficiency. The Bill will establish a new class of controlled action under the EPBC Act relating to emissions which damage the surfaces of important monuments. When this is shown to be occurring, an entity that continues to pollute despite the damage will receive a civil financial penalty under the EPBC Act. The penalties for non-compliance are in line with the rest of the Act. The Bill will insert an item into Section 34 of the EPBC Act. That item is 'the National Heritage values of a National Heritage place'. This establishes National Heritage values as being important to the Act. A person that is a corporation, the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth entity contravenes the Act if the person or entity takes a damaging industrial action within what's called the 'prohibited area' for a vulnerable monument. Prohibited areas will be defined through scientific investigation. A person who proposes to take an action that may significantly impact a monument that is part of a National Heritage place must cause a vulnerability investigation to be conducted for the monument. The purpose of the vulnerability investigation is to determine whether damaging industrial action is causing, or is likely to cause, damage to the monument. If a vulnerability investigation finds that damaging industrial action is causing damage to a monument, the Minister must declare the monument to be a vulnerable monument, and must declare a prohibited area around the monument. The investigation will also determine whether preventing damaging industrial activity in a particular area would prevent or minimise future damage. The Western Australian Government has tried to deny that airborne emissions cause damaging compounds to form on the surface of rock art. This is not surprising, seeing as the WA Government always seeks to boost the gas industry, regardless of the consequences. University of Western Australia archaeology expert Benjamin Smith has pointed to the scientific consensus showing that emissions such as nitrogen oxides have an acidic effect that destroys the surface of stone monuments. Professor Smith has also been involved in research involving the first photographic evidence of the art being damaged since industry arrived on the Burrup in the 1960s. Photos, taken about 50 years apart, clearly show artworks that have faded and had their surfaces peeled away. In all, photographs of 26 pieces of rock art, or petroglyphs, taken prior to or early in the industrialisation process were compared with recent pictures. Professor Smith said 50 per cent of them had changed, and he has stated clearly, 'Once those rock surfaces start to degrade, there's nothing one can do. We have to stop the acidity getting on to the rocks.' Of course, this is disputed by the companies that operate on the Burrup. The WA Government launched its own monitoring program in 2019, which was jointly funded by Woodside, the Yara fertiliser company, and iron ore giant Rio Tinto. There was no attempt to put the program at arm's length from parties with a vested interest. Anyone could be forgiven for being sceptical about the objectivity of the study. Woodside backed the government's monitoring and said previous research did not prove LNG production was damaging the rock art. A Woodside spokesperson said, 'The photographic methodology used [by Professor Smith] is not a reliable means of determining such changes'. In other words, the evidence from your own eyes, when examining Professor Smith's photos, should be ignored. This Bill bypasses all of that. It puts the onus on the proponent of a development, or an expansion, to prove scientifically that they are not destroying a monument. Let's make the law match the science, and let's see what the evidence shows. If we have to talk about money to make people understand the value of our heritage, look at the tourism value of Murujuga. When we tell people that Western Australia is home to some of the world's oldest artworks, tourists come in droves. They want to see. Most of the potential is untapped. A boardwalk has been constructed near some of the most visible pieces, and the numbers are growing. Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation wants to establish a new benchmark for Indigenous tourism with a Tourism Precinct at Conzinc Bay on the western side of the peninsula. The precinct will include the Murujuga Living Knowledge Centre, eco-accommodation and day-use facilities at the bay. The business case for the precinct is being drawn up now. WA Tourism's new approach to its work is all about First Nations heritage. The WA Visitor Economy Strategy 2033—or WAVES 2033—that came out last year, talks about a vision for Western Australia 'to be recognised as a world-class destination that immerses people in its unique cultures, communities, and environment'. Murujuga could not be more relevant to that goal. Tourism is Australia's third biggest export and we must start valuing the assets that underpin the industry. Tourism brings in an enormous amount of revenue, and that revenue is different to the revenue from other industries, because tourism spreads the benefits around. Most of the beneficiaries are smaller, localised businesses. The money doesn't disappear overseas or line the pockets of the already-rich. Tourism benefits all Australians. We as Australians all have a critical role to play and we have seen extensive campaigns, including the open letter from 95 top Australian and international artists who united to stop the destruction of one of the world's greatest artwork. People are fascinated to see and visit a place and to have an experience like no other, which brings to our shores visitors from all over the world. And it's not just the rock art—the country and wildlife that inspired the art are grounded in story, time and place. If we protect these precious and sacred places like Murujuga, we can continue to showcase them to the world. This Bill inserts a new value into the considerations of the EPBC Act—the value of some of our most important national heritage. More than that, this is our heritage as human beings. We are talking about 45,000 years of human history. Murujuga has been put forward as a World Heritage site for a reason. Not for the first time, I ask the Parliament to put heritage in all its forms, but in particular First Nations cultural heritage, above a quick buck for a few corporations. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.  Leave granted; debate adjourned.","We All Come Together For Country Bill 2025","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator COX (Western Australia) ","(16:11):","N/A"

I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill. Leave granted.  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.  Leave granted. The speech read as follows— The inclusion of mandatory minimum sentencing in Labor's Hate Crimes Bill earlier this year was an absolute disgrace. When the bill came to the Senate, I made it clear that this was a disgusting breach of civil liberties, born from a completely unnecessary dirty deal between the Labor and Liberal Parties. And it was rammed through at the last minute in a highly charged political atmosphere that we now know was based on a hoax by known criminals. It now appears that the community and the crossbench were fed lies to manufacture consent for an attack on the rights of Australians to a fair trial. When this bill passed, I didn't think I could be more disgusted by a gutless Labor Party that goes out of its way to align itself with Mr Dutton's Liberals. The ALP 2023 Platform states the following: 'Labor opposes mandatory sentencing. This practice does not reduce crime but does undermine the independence of the judiciary, leads to unjust outcomes, and is often discriminatory in practice.' Labor has not only once again capitulated to the Liberals, but in doing so they have acted in direct contradiction to their own party platform. And, still, you know what the most galling part of this debacle is? The original bill had the numbers to pass. There was no need to make a dirty deal with Mr Dutton. But as usual, Labor would rather deal with the Liberal Party to pass racist laws than work with the progressive crossbench. We are not seeking to repeal the Hate Crimes bill, just the dirty deal that brought in mandatory minimum sentencing. The dangers of mandatory sentencing are well known. Legal expert after legal expert tells us mandatory minimum sentencing simply does not work. It takes judicial decisions out of the hands of judges and courts and into the hands of politicians. The Australian Law Reform Commission has highlighted that mandatory minimum sentences are discriminatory and in breach of our international human rights obligations. The Law Council of Australia president, Juliana Warner, has said that mandatory sentencing laws are 'arbitrary and limit the individual's right to a fair trial', and the organisation has warned that mandatory sentencing refuses to take into account the personal circumstances of an offender, and therefore, the laws disproportionately affect vulnerable groups. Australian Lawyers Alliance spokesperson, Greg Barns SC, has said there is 'simply no evidence' to support mandatory sentencing. We do, however, have extensive evidence that mandatory sentences disproportionately and unfairly target First Nations people and other people of colour. The Australian Law Reform Commission that mandatory sentencing increases incarceration, is costly, ineffective as a crime deterrent and can disproportionately affect marginalised groups. Go and speak to any community lawyer or peak legal body and they will categorically tell you that mandatory sentences are unjust, inappropriate, and highly discriminatory. A recent Conversation article by legal scholars described the mandatory sentencing amendments that are 'populist, knee-jerk reactions [that] are highly unlikely to make the community safer.'[] Politicians are not in a position to understand the individual circumstances of a case, and there is no justifying politicians intervening in judicial discretion. I oppose mandatory minimum sentencing for all the reasons law experts have given, including because we should not strip the judiciary of its ability to assess cases individually, it undermines judicial independence, and it undermines a fair trial. I receive racist, Islamophobic, and misogynistic hate constantly. I want consequences for hate crimes, but mandatory minimum sentencing makes no one safer. It is egregious, unjust and discriminatory. I can already see the eyerolls from the Liberals as soon as I mention Islamophobia. Yes, Islamophobia exists. It is extensively documented. I remind the Senate of Senator Sharma's shameful claim that there is a 'fictitious Islamophobia which was not going on.' And not a word of condemnation from anyone in this place. Imagine if that had been said about any other group. The latest Islamophobia register's report documents the rise in anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hate. Muslim women are being spat at, punched in the face, their hijabs being torn off, racist graffiti is rampant, and two mosques have now had threats referencing the Christchurch Mosque massacre where an Australian man with an extreme far-right, white supremacist and Islamophobic ideology murdered 51 Muslims. But to the Liberal Party, Muslim lives simply don't matter. We've known that for a very long time. And Labor is meek, mediocre and morally compromised. They have again capitulated to the Liberals to push through this bad law. And we must talk about the elephant in the room, the criminal attacks on the Jewish community that Labor and the Liberals appear to have exploited, weaponised, and politicised to push through these mandatory minimum sentencing laws. Following the revelations that the caravan found with explosives was part of a 'fabricated terrorist plot', Executive Officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, Sarah Schwartz, made the following comments: Yesterday's statement from the AFP should prompt reflection from every politician, journalist and community leader who has sought to manipulate and weaponise fears within the Jewish community. The attempt to link these events to the support of Palestinians—whether at protests, universities, conferences or writers festivals—has been irresponsible and dangerous. It is now clear that individuals are seeking to exploit the Jewish community, and the broader public's concern about antisemitism. Disinformation and irresponsible reporting is providing a permissive environment for these malicious acts. We restate our calls for politicians to act responsibly and stop using the Jewish community as political footballs to push divisive agendas. The Prime Minister has serious questions to answer. If the AFP knew almost immediately that the caravan plot was a hoax and linked to organised crime, why did Labor whip up media hysteria and community fear? Did they push these laws through under false pretences? There was no justification for mandatory minimum sentencing in the first place, but now that the truth is public, there is even more reason to repeal these provisions. Sentencing should be up to judges, not politicians. And certainly not politicians in the Labor and Liberal Parties, who thrive on stoking fear and division. That is why these mandatory sentencing provisions must be repealed. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.  Leave granted; debate adjourned.","Crimes Amendment (Repeal Mandatory Minimum Sentences) Bill 2025","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator FARUQI (New South Wales) ","(16:12):","N/A"

When he was seeking the endorsement of the Australian community to be Prime Minister, Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said—and I'll say this very clearly—'Families will be better off under a Labor government.' So said Anthony Albanese. He also said, 'Under our watch, what we have is a plan to reduce costs for working families.' Well, three years later, we know that that has just not been the case. Australian families have been ravaged by cost-of-living pressures. They've been ravaged by mortgage stress. And we know, as of today, there have been 27,000 small business insolvencies. But when Australians go to vote, I hope that they will think not about the next few weeks but the next few years, because in last night's budget papers was a clear indication that the future of this country is now perilous. The economic crisis—the financial insecurity—that has ravaged families and small business is now a national financial and economic crisis. Let me tell you why. The budget papers show that gross debt for our country will surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever next financial year. The budget papers also show that the 10-year timetable that had existed to bring our budget back to balance has now been surpassed and that, now, bringing our budget back into balance is in the never-never. More than that, pre-election decisions made by this government—indeed, by Senator Gallagher, the Minister for Finance, who's in the chamber this afternoon—have worsened the budget bottom line by $34.9 billion. The government's decisions made before the election has even started have worsened the budget bottom line by $34.9 billion. Then the discretionary decisions of the government, which are decisions made by the government in the normal course of governing the country, have worsened the budget bottom line by $112 billion. This information is contained in Labor's own budget that was delivered last night. So you're asking yourself: how are we paying for this? Let me tell you how you are paying for this. Revenue to government has increased in this country on the back of increased takings from personal income taxes and from very, very high commodity prices for things like iron ore, coal and gas. That is how these things are being paid for. It's not because the government has demonstrated any blood, sweat or tears in making sure the books are balanced, in making sure that your hard-earned taxpayer dollar is being put to the best possible use in the government—no, not at all. The $34.9 billion of extra pre-election decisions and the $112 billion of discretionary decisions taken by the government are all paid for off the back of increased personal income taxes and high commodity prices for iron ore, coal and gas. Government spending, as demonstrated in this budget, is up 8.7 per cent to $731 billion, and federal spending is forecast to hit 27 per cent of GDP next financial year. It has not been that high for over 40 years. So what does this mean? In an uncertain and volatile world, if things were to go bad for our country, if iron ore prices were to collapse, if prices for coal and gas were to collapse, guess who would be left stranded? You, the Australian family and the Australian small business, because in that budget last night there is no insurance policy for when things go wrong in this country. There is no lifejacket for the Australian economy in last night's budget. If you're voting for the future, you must vote Labor last.

The compare-and-contrast on the alternative Treasurer, Mr Taylor, could not be more stark. Australians should not allow Mr Taylor anywhere near Australia's budget. Australians should not allow Mr Taylor anywhere near Australia's economy. Mr Taylor cannot even tell Australians how much the coalition's nuclear never-never nonsense will cost Australians. He says it will cost 44 per cent less—44 per cent less than some amount that he can't identify, despite having procured his own dodgy costings of this nuclear never-never policy.  Well, I am 100 per cent sure that Mr Taylor is about 40 per cent sure of what is actually going on in this country right now.

Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is the recitation of old rhetoric from now four budgets, where the government has promised now four times that it will deliver housing policies, which have clearly failed. Four times the government have announced, in four budgets, a housing agenda which is yet to build a single house. It would be hard to choose, when you go through the dreadful budget speech of Mr Chalmers, which quote is the worst, but I'd have to say that it's probably this one here: Our $33 billion plan will help build 1.2 million new homes before the decade is out. This is a target—1.2 million new houses—which, as any and every economist and housing specialist and even the Treasury itself has shown, the government has no chance of ever meeting. It shows how out of touch this government is that every time we meet here in Canberra we hear how great things are and how this government, the Labor government, has done such a great job. We hear that people should be so happy and fortunate and people should come to Canberra and give their thanks to Mr Chalmers and Mr Albanese for doing such a great job. But one of the reasons that younger Australians are so squeezed and so annoyed about housing is that housing construction has collapsed under this government. This government has presided over a collapse in housing construction and a massive influx of immigrants. One million people have come into the country in the last couple of years, and housing construction has collapsed. There are a million new people and only 160,000 new houses a year. You don't need an economics degree, a PhD or a school-leaving certificate to work out the mathematics. A million more people all need somewhere to live. You can't live nowhere. They need houses, and this government has collapsed the building of new houses. Tradespeople, builders, developers—they all know. If you're not sure, I can tell you, because I asked the Parliamentary Library. Under the last government, on average, 195,000 houses were built every year. The peak, of 210,000 houses, was in 2018. Under this government, we're down to 170,000 houses. There are a million more people and we're heading south on housing construction, yet we hear, in the budget speech, 'We're going to build 1.2 million new houses.' There is no trajectory that anyone can show us or that will ever be realised. So this is a bizarre budget full of untruths. Perhaps the silver medallist here is his quote about the Housing Australia Future Fund: The first two rounds— Mr Chalmers says— of the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund are helping build … 18,000 … homes … Well, guess what? After 18 months of operation, how many houses has the HAFF built? Is it 18,000? Is it 14,000? Is it 12,000? Is it 5,000? Is it a hundred? It's a duck. It's on a duck. I believe, when you read the budget speech, the most striking thing is that the Labor Party think that the Australian people are stupid and that Labor can roll out this rubbish every year they have a budget and commit to things and promise things that they know will never materialise. Meanwhile, in the real world, people can't afford to buy a first house or a first flat because housing construction has collapsed and migration is through the roof. This is a callous and cold budget, the government should be ashamed, and now the Australian people get to have their say.

Defence knows this. Why, then, did the Treasurer fail to mention climate or environment once in his budget speech last night? Because, for them, it's an inconvenient truth standing between them and their corporate cosy-up agenda. And now, with a middle finger to every person and community group doing their best to protect our precious forests, waterways and wildlife, Labor and the coalition are teaming up to ram through legislation that waters down our already weak nature laws. Their goal? Protecting the toxic salmon industry at any cost. The maugean skate is on the brink of extinction in Macquarie Harbour—nothing to see here. Environment laws might get in the way of corporate profits for a bunch of multinational corporations—quick, get laws through under the cover of the budget. That the government appears to be willing to put the future of an entire species at risk at the behest of one industry is truly outrageous.  Those on both sides of the chamber are completely captured by big business. And while this decision was made with the stinky, rotten salmon industry in mind, it will have far-reaching consequences beyond that. It will encourage big polluters to seek other industry-specific carve-outs—a free-for-all. It will make it harder for communities to challenge dirty fossil-fuel projects or deforestation projects. It will further erode the role of science in policymaking at a time when we should be strengthening it. I mean, Labor's own conservation advice describes the pollution created by salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour as being 'catastrophic'. This isn't just one policy; it's a dangerous trend of science and evidence being wound back. Labor once promised to uphold the role of environmental science through stronger laws, but now, three years later, they've backtracked, erasing nature from the agenda. This government's latest attack on nature means that environmental protections are weaker now than when Labor took government three years ago. They are weaker now. Environment laws are meant to protect the environment, not green-light destruction. Just once, Labor, show some courage for our kids—our kids who have the right to inherit a world in the same order as we've been able to enjoy it. Put the future of our precious, beautiful planet first, ahead of a quick corporate buck. This is an insult to every Australian who trusted Labor to deliver real change in nature. It's a betrayal of our environment, traditional owners and future generations. It's disgraceful, and everyone in this chamber with a conscience knows it. So, with the election imminent, it is clear that neither major party will deliver on environmental protection. Only the Greens will keep fighting for our climate justice and a secure future for all.

Australians rightly complain that politicians from both major parties have no vision for our country's future prosperity. It's all just short-term budgets that never look beyond the next election. That's why, tonight, One Nation is moving an amendment to the 2025 budget that would benefit our children's children and everyone in Australia today. If successful, our amendment would remove the secret tax, the stealth tax, known as bracket creep. Bracket creep is where the government quietly takes more tax from Australians because of inflation. The government uses inflation to take more tax out of every Australian. This simple amendment to end bracket creep would save Australians tens of billions of dollars each year. It's another One Nation plan to put more money back in your pocket.  So let me explain. As inflation continues, wages increase to try and keep up. A salary might go up from $100,000 to $120,000, and yet, because of inflation, you can still only buy the same things because prices have risen. Despite being able to only buy the same things, your tax bill goes up because, on paper, the salary has gone up and been pushed into a higher tax bracket with a higher rate of tax. Inflation pushes up the salary you need to survive every year, yet the tax thresholds stay in exactly the same place. As salaries increase, they enter a higher tax rate bracket. This is bracket creep. One Nation would end it. We would index the income tax thresholds to inflation so you do not enter a higher tax rate bracket, making sure Australians don't pay a higher tax rate because of inflation. Tax reform is mentioned a lot in parliament. Here's a genuine opportunity to do it. Australians are being squeezed from every angle. The current tax system is bleeding Australians dry while letting foreign multinational corporations rip off the country. Tonight, One Nation is proposing a policy that will tip the balance back towards helping Australians, because we believe in putting more money back in Australians' pockets. At the election, vote One Nation No. 1.

We're banning non-compete clauses, to help another three million Australians. But the Liberals and Nationals, of course, have opposed or voted against so many initiatives about workers' rights and better pay.  These initiatives include: multi-employer bargaining reform, including establishing the supported bargaining stream for low-paid feminised industries; empowering the Fair Work Commission to arbitrate and track more bargaining disputes; banning unilateral termination of enterprise agreements; getting rid of or sunsetting zombie clauses, zombie agreements; simplifying the better off overall test; improving the process of enterprise agreement approval by the Fair Work Commission; simplifying the process to initiate bargaining; simplifying the process to conduct protected action ballots; making job security and agenda equality objects of the Fair Work Act; limiting the use of repeat fixed-term projects; prohibiting sexual harassment in connection with work; establishing a pay equity expert panel and caring community sector expert panel within the Fair Work Commission; prohibiting pay secrecy clauses; making it easier to request flexible work arrangements; increasing the cap on small-claim proceedings, prohibiting job ads with illegal pay rates; improving workers compensation access for firefighters; strengthening protection for migrant workers; giving stronger access to unpaid parental leave; adding superannuation contributions to the National Employment Standards; improving long-service leave access for casual workers; improving paid parental leave, including increasing it from 18 weeks to 26 weeks; legislating paying superannuation on paid parental leave; introducing 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave; advocating for low-paid workers in the Fair Work Commission's minimum wage case; fully funding aged-care and early childhood wage increases in the federal budget; same job, same pay for labour hire workers; changes to casual definition and conversions; criminalisation of wage theft; extending the power of the Fair Work Commission to employee-like forms of work; giving workers the right to challenge unfair contractual terms; allowing the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards to ensure the road transport industry is safe, sustainable and viable; and providing stronger protections against discrimination, adverse action and harassment. In the five quarters before our first budget, in 2022, real wages fell in annual terms. That's what the coalition delivered to this country and to working Australians. Now, under an Albanese Labor government, they've grown for the last five consecutive quarters. Under this government, there's more to do—but there's more being done than those across the aisle have ever done. They're determined to make sure they oppose every initiative about making sure that working people have fair rights and fair arrangements. What's quite clear is these regulations and these opportunities are opportunities for good business when they're competing with bad business, business that turns around and their objective is to exploit and take advantage. The idea of getting rid of these laws, opposing these laws, means all Australians—those in those businesses that are striving to do better, to include their workforce, pay decent wages—are competing with the scoundrels that these people want to empower by taking these laws away. It's in their DNA—the Liberals and Nationals—when people are doing it tough, to rip away their rights. Mr Barnaby Joyce said, in March 2024, that increases to the minimum wage were 'window dressing', when hundreds of dollars more were paid than the minimum wage. Mr Peter Dutton said that he was deeply concerned about our workplace relations laws because they were going to 'result in higher wages'; he said that in October 2022. Mr Angus Taylor said that he opposes multi-employer bargaining because, heaven forbid, it pushes up wages! That was in September 2022. You have to go to their DNA. Scott Morrison, then Prime Minister, in May 2022, said that Albanese's call for a $1 hourly increase to the minimum wage was 'reckless and dangerous' and that he was a 'loose unit'. Mathias Cormann, then finance minister, said in March 2019, 'Low wages growth is a deliberate design feature of our economic architecture.' That's exactly what Mr Dutton wants to deliver for all Australians. The coalition want you to work longer for less. They want you to not earn more and to not keep more of what you earn. That's the opposite of what we want.

I'll give you that, Senator Sheldon. You made an attempt. Of course, what you read out was the laundry list that the union movement gave you before you got into government, but we'll put that to one side and we'll talk about the budget from last night, a budget that has disappeared without a trace.  I've been around this building in one capacity or another for quite a long time, and I have never seen a budget go down like a lead balloon in quite the way the Labor budget from yesterday evening did. There's the slogan about tax cuts. Clearly the Treasurer wanted a front-page headline with the words 'tax cuts'. He didn't care how small it was. He didn't care if it was 70c a day—while, on the other hand, inflation under this Labor government eats that up literally in minutes. Inflation under this government has made every Australian family worse off, not by 70c a day but by tens of thousands of dollars over the course of this government, whether it's electricity bills, where the Labor Party's renewables-only policy has pushed up prices by thousands; whether it's mortgages, where inflation has caused interest rate increases under this Labor government that have put tens of thousands of dollars onto everyday Australians' mortgages; or whether it's the 20,000 small businesses that have gone into administration under this Labor government. Those small businesses are facing the pressure of high interest rates, high supply costs and the inability to pass those costs on to their consumers and, at the same time, are facing the increasing involvement of the union movement, which is imposing itself on workplaces where there was no desire to have the union involved. You've got to remember, as this Labor government is out there shelling for the union movement, that the union movement represents less than one in 10 private sector workers. Unions do not represent workers. They represent a tiny cadre of workers in this country, and this Labor government is merely here to support those unions. As this government goes down like a lead balloon, let's look at what wasn't in the budget. What was completely absent from the budget? Any mention of the importance of the North West Shelf decision. In fact, while the budget was being delivered, Tanya Plibersek again kicked the can down the road regarding a decision on the extension of the North West Shelf project. Everyone knows the North West Shelf project will be extended, but Western Australia will be at a near-term gas supply risk if that project is not extended. This is blocking $30 billion worth of investment.

If you are a FIFO worker; if you are involved in the oil and gas industry; if you're involved in any part of the manufacturing sector in WA—and 70 per cent of Western Australia's industrial energy comes from gas—if you are one of the many tens of thousands of households in Perth that rely on gas; or if you are one of the many tens of thousands of workers that rely on, yes, supplying gas to key allies overseas like Japan, then, for goodness sake, Australians, this is what you're going to vote for.

Last year, during this time in Ramadan, I couldn't stop thinking about Palestine. Every moment—fasting, breaking my fast, sleeping, waking, working—Palestine was on my mind. I kept wondering: how could things possibly get any worse? The genocide was live streamed for the world to see. It wasn't hidden. I don't think I will ever be able to forget the horrific images of children being bombed, being snipered and being starved to death. And what was our government's response? Best case, we saw the mildest of criticism, always framed in Israel's right to defend itself. Some government MPs even travelled to Israel to meet with war criminals and watch the destruction firsthand. I hope this election marks the end of their time in parliament.  Here we are in another Ramadan. The brief respite Palestinians had was destroyed when Israel broke the ceasefire, although we know that there never really was a ceasefire. Then came the criminal act of cutting off life-saving aid, tightening the noose around the neck of some of the most vulnerable people on earth, followed by the resumed slaughter of hundreds of men, women and children. In just a few days, refugee camps and hospitals were being bombed once again. The settler colonial state continues its attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, seizing more land to expand its apartheid settlements. Just this week Hamdan Ballal, the Palestinian co-director of Oscar winning film No Other Land, was abducted and assaulted by settlers. This Ramadan I am wiser. I know that there is no red line for Labor when it comes to Palestine. There are no limits to their inhumanity and their cowardice. There are no limits to their shamelessness, hypocrisy and double standards when it comes to protecting the apartheid State of Israel. They ruthlessly pursue anyone who dares to criticise Israel or challenge their narrative. They drove Senator Payman out of their party. They withdrew artist Khaled Sabsabi and curator Michael Dagostino from the Venice Biennale. Academic Randa Abdel-Fattah faces relentless targeting. The level of impunity they provide Israel and its partner the US was there for all to see when neither our Prime Minister nor our foreign minister could bring themselves to even denounce Trump's plan to literally ethnically cleanse Gaza and take it over. We know you have double standards. When Russia commits war crimes, you uphold international law and standards. But, when Israel does the same, there is complete and utter silence. I do not know what else I can say to convince you to act. There are at least 50,000 dead, likely closer to 200,000, mostly women and children. If that's not enough, I don't know what will be. So I will say this. These are the final words of a 23-year-old Al Jazeera journalist, Hossam Shabat. Of course Israel and their bootlicker friends in the conservative media claim that Shabat was a fighter, something the Committee to Protect Journalists called unsubstantiated. It is a well-known tactic of Israel to cover their tracks of murdering journalists to try and cut off the coverage of the genocide. Shabat's final message was this: If you're reading this, it means I have been killed—most likely targeted—by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old—a college student with dreams like anyone else. For past 18 months, I have dedicated every moment of my life to my people. I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined to show the world the truth they tried to bury. I slept on pavements, in schools, in tents—anywhere I could. Each day was a battle for survival. I endured hunger for months, yet I never left my people's side. … … … I ask you now: do not stop speaking about Gaza. Do not let the world look away. Keep fighting, keep telling our stories—until Palestine is free. The Greens and I will keep fighting. We will keep speaking out about Palestine. We will never be silenced.

Undoubtedly, it's been a tragedy for all those involved—the Palestinian people of Gaza, the Israeli people and the people of the region. But what I find troubling about this motion and many others like it is that it only ever attributes moral agency to one party in this conflict, and that is Israel. There are multiple parties to this conflict. The conflict was started by the terrorist organisation Hamas unleashing one of the most brutal and barbaric terrorist acts of the modern era on the civilian population in Israel and taking many of the civilians hostage. Where is the motion calling on Hamas to release the hostages that would help bring this conflict to an end? Where is the motion calling on Hamas to relinquish its role as the political and military authority in Gaza that would help bring this conflict to an end? That's something that the Palestinian Authority, the Fatah leadership, did just last week. Where is a motion condemning a number of the regional actors who are involved in sustaining this conflict, whether it's the Houthis in Yemen or it's Iran and its support of the armed terrorist proxy groups that are found in abundance in the region?  We've got to where we are today because Hamas refused multiple offers and approaches to extend phase 1 of the ceasefire. Phase 1 of the ceasefire, which expired on 1 March, was meant to provide for the release of hostages and the cessation of hostilities. Hamas was offered, by the US mediator Steve Witkoff and by Qatari and Egyptian authorities and intermediaries, the option to extend that ceasefire so that the fighting would continue to cease, so that the people of Gaza could continue to return to their homes and so that Israel could get its hostages back. Hamas still holds some 60 hostages, of which we have hopes that, perhaps, 25 are alive. But Hamas refused these attempts. It didn't want to continue with the ceasefire. It wanted to resume hostilities and resume conflict. As long as Hamas remains in control of Gaza, as long as Hamas does not accept that it can no longer play a future role in Gaza and as long as Hamas does not accept that the continued detention of hostages is an ongoing war crime, I don't see much alternative for the nation of Israel other than to seek to recover its hostages. That is undoubtedly a terrible tragedy for the Palestinian people, the Gazan population and their region. But any sovereign state would expect its government to do its utmost to recover its hostages. They've tried it through negotiations. Hostages have been released through negotiations. Hamas is refusing to release any more hostages. So, until such time as Hamas can be brought to its senses—and motions like this that make no mention of the role of Hamas, Hamas's moral agency and Hamas's instigation of the conflict, frankly, do not help— ","Middle East","MATTERS OF URGENCY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

They might signal to an audience that's important to you where you sit on the conflict, but they do not help resolve the conflict. Ultimately, this conflict will be resolved when Hamas releases all the hostages and recognises it cannot and should not play any future role in the governance of Gaza. The Palestinian people—the Gazan population—have been protesting about Hamas's actions in resuming this conflict and breaking this ceasefire in recent days. The other, more legitimate element that governs Palestine, the Palestinian Authority, led by Fatah, have called on Hamas to relinquish any future role in the governance of Gaza, because they recognise that the fate of the Gazan Palestinian population is being prejudiced by Hamas's continued intransigence here.  So by all means let's discuss this conflict in this parliament, including in this chamber, but let's also recognise that there are multiple parties that have moral agency in this conflict, and Hamas has been the most intransigent actor of all of them.

It's not a considered motion. It's not a motion that advances the cause of peace or builds unity in our community here in Australia.  The conflict in the Middle East is a long and complex one, and it is characterised by divergent perspectives and disputed history. It's existed for a very long time. But the current war in Gaza was begun on 7 October 2023 by a heinous terrorist attack by Hamas on the people of Israel. That attack resulted in the worst loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. The anguish of that day has been extended by the taking of more than 250 hostages, and we have heard and learned of the horror of their treatment as time has gone on. The war that has followed has been a humanitarian disaster. The unbearable scenes of conflict, the loss of innocent life and the devastating effect on the Palestinian people have shocked the people of Australia and people around the world. On behalf of the people of Australia, the government has consistently sought to advance the goal of a just and lasting peace that ensures the ongoing security of the State of Israel and its people and establishes a stable and peaceful Palestinian state which realises the sovereignty of the Palestinian people. The government has consistently called for an immediate and unconditional return of the hostages taken by Hamas and for a ceasefire—a cessation of hostilities—to permit the negotiation of a peace agreement that will produce that two-state solution and a stable and peaceful region. The government has sought to play an engaged and responsible role in this debate and in promoting peace, recognising that we are not a major player in the Middle East but have a respected voice and a history of support for international institutions and multilateral action in international affairs. That is why we are supporters of the ceasefire and also seek the release of the hostages by Hamas as part of that agreement. Inflammation and division within our community do nothing to advance the cause of peace. Ignorance of the importance of multilateralism in resolving international disputes, and particularly armed conflict, does nothing to advance the cause of peace; nor do other forms of extremism. In the end, in this parliament, we represent peoples and communities around Australia. Since 7 October 2023, in a variety of different ways, we've also seen behaviour in Australia that is unrecognisable to many Australians. We've seen a rise in antisemitism and antisemitic incidents; we have seen a rise in racist and Islamophobic incidents; we've seen a community more divided on this issue; and we've seen actions and behaviours that we would not traditionally have seen nor would want to see replicated. It is important that, in ensuring our future as a community and ensuring we succeed as a country, we remain a place where people of a variety of races, backgrounds, religions and views feel comfortable and safe. We need to respect each other, and we need to push for that unity. It is in that spirit and vein that the government continues to seek to advance the cause of peace in the Middle East while also providing leadership in relation to ensuring that those conflicts are not replicated in Australia and that Australia remains a united community where people of all backgrounds can feel safe and respected.

Israel has never had any genuine regard for any peace process with Palestinians over the past 78 years of its existence. This colonial project has always been hell-bent on its mission of total annihilation of the Palestinian people and their aspirations for justice, equality and the establishment of a Palestinian nation.  The only way to stop Israel from executing its genocidal mission is by massive international pressure, particularly from Western nations who are supplying their army with vital military equipment. Just last week the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report called More than a human can bear, detailing horrific crimes of sexual violence carried out by Israel against Palestinians. Yet this report has been conveniently and largely ignored by the Australian government and the mainstream media outlets. We have seen the deaths of two journalists, Hossam Shabbat and Mohammed Mansour, while mainstream media refused to report on the cold-blooded murder of their colleagues. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has determined that Israel is practising racial segregation and apartheid in the occupied Palestinian territory. Bob Hawke, during apartheid in South Africa, successfully pressured the global financial sector to divert from South Africa, which directly contributed to the collapse of the apartheid regime. Why is Australia treating Israel's apartheid differently? Since Israel invaded Gaza in 2023 we have seen a tidal wave of solidarity and of staunch resistance, a movement of millions of people taking to the streets, making their voices heard, asking their representatives to call the accumulating atrocities what they are: a genocide. Yet this government hasn't even got the guts to call it so. The major parties this morning, in opposing my genocide bill, showed they are not willing to act on genocide and accountability for war crimes or crimes against humanity. This country supplies weapons to Israel, without which they wouldn't be able to commit these crimes. This isn't just complicity; it is enabling of war crimes and genocide. The government claims it has legal advice affirming that its actions are in line with international law, yet it refuses to release this. It is exactly what one would expect of a colonial institution that never even signed a treaty with its First Peoples. This colony was built on genocide and is now enabling another one. On the national day of action for Palestine, I call on this government to repair the hurt you have caused by finally acting and imposing an arms embargo and sanctions on the State of Israel— ","Middle East","MATTERS OF URGENCY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator THORPE (Victoria) ","(16:59):","N/A"

Since the apparent breakdown of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the State of Israel has launched a series of devastating attacks on civilians, hospitals and journalists. There are countless examples of the State of Israel breaching international humanitarian law.  In the last few weeks we have seen the passage of aid into Gaza being blocked once again, and we have seen the deaths of hundreds of adults and children. Hospitals, including the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital and the Nasser Hospital, have faced bombardment. Statements from healthcare workers on the ground at the Nasser Hospital are devastating. The level of both trauma and injury, and the scenes of sheer inhumanity can never be justified. Human Rights Watch have shared that their witnesses at three hospitals in Gaza have described that the State of Israel's military forces have denied electricity, food, water and medicines, and that they have mistreated health workers and deliberately destroyed medical facilities. I would like to use some of the time here today to share with the Senate the experience of Dr Mohammed Mustafa. Dr Mustafa is from Perth, and he is currently in Gaza working in the Baptist hospital as a volunteer with the Palestinian Australian New Zealand Medical Association. In statements in the last few days he has described the situation as 'catastrophic'. He has shared that 'it seems like we have been cut off from the world', and, as Dr Mustafa described the situation—the lack of medicine, the lack of ventilators and the impact of bombardment on children—he called on the Australian government to do something. Meanwhile, the Australian government has failed to take significant action. Human Rights Watch have called out the lack of political and diplomatic pressure. It is clear that the Australian government is not doing all it can to prevent further atrocities. Amnesty International Australia has called on the Australian government to 'exert pressure on the Israeli government to immediately end its renewed bombardment of the Gaza Strip' by putting an end to military coordination and to work to 'restore the flow of humanitarian aid, guarantee unrestricted access to food and medicine, and rebuild Gaza's decimated health and sanitation infrastructure'. What is clear is that Australia is not a helpless bystander. We have the power and we should be using it. The Greens are a party of peace, and my colleagues and I continue to call for an immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire, and an end to the genocide and the occupation—and, yes, for the release of all hostages and political prisoners. Along with human rights experts, I urge the Senate to take action today. We must work to rectify the injustice we see in ways that enable both Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace, security and equality in line with international law.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","468","Senator SHOEBRIDGE","169119","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Just yesterday, seven Jewish groups from across Australia signed a statement condemning the Israeli government's decision to break the hostage and ceasefire agreement negotiated in January 2025 and resume the horrific bombardment of Palestinians in Gaza. Those groups were the Jewish Women 4 Peace Action Ready Group, the Australian Jewish Democratic Society, Australian Jewish members of the leadership team of Sydney Friends of Standing Together, Jews for Palestine WA, Jews Against the Occupation '48, the Jewish Council of Australia, and Emet. I won't have time to read the full statement, but I think it's instructive that we see the courage and the moral compass that these groups have shown in delivering that statement to the Australian government and the Australian people. The statement says, in part:  We, Jewish Australians, oppose the Israeli government's decision to break the hostage and ceasefire agreement negotiated in January 2025 and resume the horrific bombardment of Palestinians in Gaza. It further says: On 18 March, the Israeli military launched a wave of airstrikes in Gaza, massacring over 750 (and rising) Palestinians, including countless children. Survivors of Israel's assault face excruciating conditions, including having to endure amputations without anaesthesia. Palestinians in Gaza are suffering from famine, the destruction of healthcare systems, relentless aerial attacks, and are now being subjected to a new wave of violence. They conclude: We reject any naive suggestion that the Netanyahu government has renewed fighting in order to bring back the Israeli hostages. The resumption of the bombardment of Gaza only endangers the lives of the hostages further, while ensuring death and destruction of Palestinians in Gaza. We call on the Australian Government to immediately censure the Netanyahu government's resumption of war in the strongest terms and move to imposing sanctions on the state of Israel. I say on behalf of my party and, I know, millions of Australians: I thank them all for the courage they've taken in putting that clear statement on the record. When we ask what the complicity of the Australian government is, we should reflect upon what this parliament has done in the last 12 months. In the last 12 months we have taken no steps to stop the trade of weapons with Israel. In fact, we've gone further. We have removed all constraints on exports of weapons and military equipment between Australia and the United States. And do you know what the Trump administration did earlier this year? They removed any consideration of international humanitarian law for the transport of weapons and methods of killing from the United States to the rest of the world. So we are now in the situation where we send weapons to the United States with no constraints, no controls and no licences, and they can now send weapons made in Australia anywhere in the world, to any conflict, including Israel, without any consideration of humanitarian law. We are deeply complicit in the F-35s and we are now complicit in our entire supply chain. We call on the government to act.

It's not a war, as the apologists for what is going on over there claim it is. It's not a conflict; it's not a war. I'll tell you what it is. It's a slaughter. It's a barbaric murder spree. It is an ethnic cleansing. It's a genocide. It is a war crime. It's resulted in tens of thousands of people, countless of them—innocent babies and children—being blown to bits, being dismembered, being buried alive under rubble. And Australia is complicit; Labor has made us so.  We're not just supplying weapons components and military hardware. We're not just supporting the US and, presumably, Israel in their military operations through facilities like Pine Gap. I mean, we could not even bring ourselves to criticise US President Donald Trump, that dangerous demagogue and fascist, when he openly admitted to having a goal of ethnically cleansing Gaza so he could redevelop it into some kind of bizarre, obscene resort for wealthy colonisers. It is utterly disgraceful how complicit Labor has allowed us to become in this country. We need to take strong action to hold the war criminals to account and to end this barbarous slaughter in Gaza.

I did wonder whether Senator Hanson-Young wasn't commenting on Tanya Plibersek's career when she brought that dead fish into the chamber. We all remember that classic scene from The Godfather where Luca Brasi's jacket was returned to the Corleone family wrapped around a dead fish, and Michael Corleone looks at the dead fish and doesn't understand. He hasn't grown up with the mafia traditions, and his brother explains to him that the dead fish, of course, represents swimming with the fishes—it means Luca Brasi is dead. I do wonder whether that was some reflection on the career of Minister Plibersek and the decision that this government has taken. But if there's any blame to be shared at home, it's to be directed to the minister, because she has now kicked the can on the North West Shelf project down the road past the election date, trying to cover for this government's lack of decision-making ability. Now, for political reasons, the Labor Party has decided to override the EPBC Act here, and, again, I'll pay tribute to Tasmanian senators—Senator Chandler is in the chamber—who have stood up for the salmon industry in their home state, and rightly so.  It does beg the question of why a $30 billion project in my and Senator Cash's home state, Western Australia, is being kicked down past the election. Why? Why would they do this, Senator Cash? I ask the question. Is it because it causes too many problems within the Labor Party itself for them to make a decision? Is it that they don't think the six years of consideration given to it at the state level is worthy, even though that was completely under the control of their own Labor colleagues in Western Australia, the Cook Labor government? There has been six years of consideration and approval, yet even though the first due date was 28 February, and then another date was set—that was changed, again—now it's been kicked down past the election. It should cause everyone whose job in Western Australia relies directly or indirectly on the oil and gas industry or the mining industry, as well as small businesses that rely on gas as an energy source, to worry, because we have commitments to our trading partners overseas, and we must meet those commitments. I was lucky enough to be in Japan last year, meeting with very senior figures. The supply of gas to Japan, particularly from Western Australia, is absolutely essential, not just for their economic security but for their national security. Anyone who thinks that the relationship with Japan, particularly in the challenging geopolitical circumstances which the world faces, is not of utmost importance to Australia is, quite frankly, fooling themselves and letting down the whole of this country, particularly my home state of Western Australia. But it's not just that we need to do the right thing by our export partners, our partners that helped invest in those projects—billions of dollars in those projects in the first place. We also need to do the right thing by my home state of Western Australia. The fact is that there is risk to the near-term gas supply—that is, in the next four or five years—if this project is not given the go-ahead. This is not a new project. That is the thing that is so baffling to all Western Australians. This is not a new project. This is a continuation of a project that was begun in the 1970s. I was a lad of seven or eight when the North West Shelf first kicked off under Sir Charles Court. It is ridiculous to think that the Greens can somehow describe this as a new project. It isn't, in fact. It's a decades-old project. It is ridiculous that this extension they are seeking was with the Western Australian state Labor government for six years, but the fact that the federal Labor government cannot make a decision keeps delaying the project, kicking the can down the road, whether for political reasons or because they know they might have to make a deal with the Greens after the next election to retain government. It's horrifying, and it should be horrifying to every Western Australian. You can be sure of only one thing. If you believe in the economic future of Western Australia, if you believe in the ability of households to continue to get their energy supplies, if you believe in manufacturing in Western Australia, and if you believe in the jobs of all those FIFO workers linked to the mining industry and the oil and gas industry in Western Australia, there is only one way to protect them, and that is: don't vote for Labor, don't vote for the Greens; put Liberal as No. 1. That is the only way of protecting those jobs, our economy, our future, our relationship with key partners like Japan and $30 billion worth of investment in Western Australia. The only way you can protect that is to vote Liberal No. 1 and put Labor and the Greens last in the upcoming election.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","483","Senator PAYMAN","300707","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Last month, I described the political collapse of negotiations and the quiet death of the nature-positive reform as emblematic of this government's Blairite, Third Way fence sitting on the environment, and I stand by it. That failure didn't please anyone—not industry, not conservationists and not communities—because the truth is that the current EPBC Act isn't working for everyone. In fact, it's working for no-one. It fails to provide real protection for our environment and it offers little certainty for industry. Instead of addressing that failure, this government has decided to double down with a bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025, that makes it painfully clear whose side it's on—and it sure isn't the environment's.  The so-called reconsiderations bill will shut down the reconsideration process currently underway into salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour. It effectively pulls the plug on efforts to protect the critically endangered maugean skate. More broadly, it risks silencing communities across the country by restricting their ability to seek reviews when environmental threats emerge. Let's be clear; this is not a small procedural tweak. This is a calculated rollback of public oversight, one that could leave entire ecosystems unprotected if species that were once considered secure become threatened over time. It removes the power of the Minister for the Environment and Water to intervene when the facts change, because, apparently, for this government, evidence based decision-making is too inconvenient. These changes didn't arise from some sweeping public mandate or scientific consensus; they were driven by an ongoing conflict between the business interests of salmon-farming giants in Macquarie Harbour and the survival of a species found only in those waters. On the very same day that this bill was announced, 20 March, Huon Aquaculture, a Tasmanian salmon-farming company, had its RSPCA animal welfare certification revoked. You may be asking why. It was because employees were caught on camera sealing live salmon in crates alongside dead ones. These are supposedly the good guys in the story. This bill is a direct intervention in an active reconsideration process about the risk salmon farming poses to the maugean skate, and let's not pretend this is just the environment minister's doing. The Prime Minister himself, who seems to have quietly assumed the role of de facto environment minister after sidelining Minister Plibersek, has once again overridden sound judgement with political opportunism. And it's not just me saying this. Let me remind the chamber of what Senator Grogan said just last month when the coalition tried to pull the same stunt. She called the reconsideration mechanism 'an important safeguard in our environmental decision-making'. She then continued, saying: Limiting reconsideration requests beyond three years and limiting who can make them is highly problematic. You're turning it into an entirely political situation, as opposed as a scientific, factual one … That was just one month ago. Would Senator Grogan repeat those words now? Would any Labor senator repeat those words? I highly doubt it. This isn't an isolated case. We're watching a disturbing pattern emerge. Labor continues to endorse coalition policy, not out of conviction but out of fear of losing political advantage. We saw it with the passage of the mandatory sentencing laws—legislation that flew in the face of Labor's own platform. We saw it again with the migration bills—so callous, so dehumanising that even the coalition's shadow immigration minister remarked that they were 'basically running the immigration system from opposition'. At what point will the Labor government's paper-thin principles give way to real moral clarity? Or is that possible only if they're dragged to it, kicking and screaming, by the political necessity of a minority government, which now looks increasingly likely to be the result of the upcoming May election? This chamber could be doing real work. We could be passing the free-TAFE bill. We could be legislating the long-overdue 20 per cent cut to HECS-HELP debt. We could be fixing the EPBC Act in a way that protects the environment for the generations to come. Instead, here we are debating a bill that actively undermines those goals. And the timing is no coincidence. With the budget freshly phlebotomised and the public's attention elsewhere, this bill has been quietly ushered in, slipped through while no-one is watching. This bill is not just a threat to the maugean skate. It is a threat to biodiversity, habitats and our already fragile ecosystems across Australia. It is the wrong decision, and it will go down as yet another black mark on the Albanese government's environmental record—a record marked by hesitation, capitulation and political cowardice.

In the first instance, can I just say thank you to the shadow minister for the environment, Senator Duniam, and the Tasmanian Liberal team. If not for their efforts prosecuting the case for the Tasmanian salmon workers down there in their home state, then, quite frankly, these people would have lost their jobs. They have quite literally, through their strong advocacy—standing up for people in Tasmania whose jobs would have been at risk if this legislation did not go through—forced the Albanese government to come to the table.  Tonight, this will finally put an end to the chaos that has been visited upon the Tasmanian salmon industry by the Albanese government and Minister Plibersek. But when you look at the title of the bill and you actually explore the bill, you see that there is so much more to it. This bill is emblematic of the chaos within the Albanese government, and this has been going on for some time now. This is not the first time this chaos has arisen. It has been happening for some time now over the environmental portfolio. In fact, some may say they haven't seen the relevant minister, Tanya Plibersek, for some time—and they'd be right, because she has been emasculated: she is not allowed to make decisions in relation to this portfolio, because, as we all know, the decisions that she would make would bell the cat in relation to what a future minority Labor-Greens-Teal government would look like. So she is literally being silenced until after the election. And no greater example of this silencing of a minister—who, but for being silenced, would make a decision, but a decision that is adverse to the people of Western Australia—is the one in relation to the extension of the North West Shelf gas hub. Anyone in Western Australia can tell you that this project is of vital importance to our great state. Quite frankly, it is an absolute disgrace, an act of cynical political manipulation, that, regarding the decision on whether to extend the life of this project—and it's not just about the life of the project; it's about what this project does, which is basically ensure that Western Australians have a supply of gas, are able to turn their lights on, whether for people living at home or for businesses, going to work every single day—Mr Albanese has told Ms Plibersek that, even though she should have made the decision last year and given certainty to the industry and, more than that, showed their true colours to Western Australians, the decision has been delayed. If that was not bad enough, there was last night. 'Sneaky' is all you can call this. Last night, on budget night, what did they quietly do? They did it with no fanfare, no announcement. The people of Western Australia have long relied on the North West Shelf gas project. As I said, gas is where we get the majority of our energy from in WA. What did Mr Albanese do? He pushed that decision out, quietly, quietly, until 31 May. What an absolute disgrace! At least have the guts to stand up, do a press conference and tell all Western Australians—in particular Premier Roger Cook, who himself stood up to Mr Albanese and said he would like to see this approved because the Western Australian government spent six years going through their approval processes and came to the decision that this project needed an extension. But, no, Mr Albanese doesn't want Western Australians to know, prior to the federal election, that he has well and truly walked away from WA. More than that: his policy decisions will have a detrimental impact on our great state. Any Western Australian knows we always need to fight to preserve our prosperity, and we are going to have a hell of a fight on our hands to preserve our prosperity in the shadows of a second-term Albanese government, governing in minority with the Australian Greens and the teals. What's so disappointing, though, about the Western Australian federal Labor members is: where are they? Where are the senators? Where's Madeleine King, the member for Brand? Where's Patrick Gorman? He's the Prime Minister's assistant minister. Where are they every day in terms of standing up and doing press conferences, standing up for the people of Western Australia—for the people they allegedly represent—and saying: 'Get your skates on. Do something that's in the best interests of the Western Australian people. Make a decision, if nothing else, on the approval of the North West Shelf gas hub extension'? Western Australians expect the people they elect to this place to stand up for Western Australia, and that is something that the WA federal Liberal team have done time and time again. We were successful in negotiating for Western Australia's fair share of the GST, and we will continue to stand up for our great state, in particular in the face of a detrimental decision to be made after the next election by Mr Albanese and Ms Plibersek. Let's talk about what the North West Shelf actually is. Anyone who understands Western Australia knows it is an economic powerhouse for our state. This is not new. They're not asking if they can turn the first sod on a project. This is a project that has been in operation, ensuring that Western Australians have a reliable supply of gas, for 40 years. On top of that, it has delivered over $40 billion in taxes and royalties since 1984. Imagine if we were to take that $40 billion away from our economy. Imagine what we would not have. But thanks to Woodside, thanks to the North West Shelf project—as I said, it's been going for 40 years—that project has delivered to the Australian economy $40 billion in taxes and royalties. But more than that, this is where Mr Albanese's true colours are coming through. Your true colours are coming through here. You've walked away from WA. What's worse is you don't have the guts to make a decision and tell us where you sit on this project. This is a project that has provided mums and dads in Western Australia, small businesses in Western Australia, manufacturers in Western Australia with a reliable source of domestic gas. That's what this project represents to us. It's not a big project up north somewhere. Mr Albanese, as the Prime Minister of our country, you are playing with our reliable source of domestic gas. You are playing with Western Australia's energy, and, quite frankly, that is unacceptable. We've made it very clear that, if we are given the privilege of being elected to government, we will ensure that we make a decision on this project within 30 days of being elected. It took Roger Cook, the Premier of Western Australia, six years to work through whether or not this project should be given an extension. And guess what? He did it. There is no logical reason not to given that the Premier of Western Australia—a Labor premier, ironically, given the stance of Mr Albanese working against our great state of Western Australia—has extended it. I can't see any reason at all that a decision cannot be made by this government. We're going to put Labor senators to a test tonight. When this legislation is voted on, we are going to be moving an amendment. Senator Duniam and the WA federal Liberal team will proudly be voting for these amendments because we believe in the state of Western Australia. We will stand up for the state of Western Australia. We want to ensure that the people of Western Australia continue to have a reliable source of domestic gas. I say to all Western Australians: you know what you're going to get under us, under a Liberal government. You'll get certainty. You'll get certainty in the economic powerhouse that is our great North West Shelf. You will get certainty on billions of dollars of future royalties flowing through to Western Australia and the Australian economy. You will get certainty for mums and dads at home, for small businesses, for manufacturing businesses, for anybody who uses energy, anybody who uses gas. Under a Peter Dutton government, you will get certainty as to what we stand for. What it also means is this: if Mr Albanese doesn't approve this project, people are going to lose their jobs. People in Western Australia will lose their jobs. Mr Albanese doesn't seem to care. So, you have a whole lot of people who currently work on the North West Shelf project who are doing what we, as Western Australians, need them to do each and every day. They've been doing it for years and years and years.

Again, he walks away from those jobs in WA.  There is no logical reason that a decision on this project could not have been made last year. There is no logical reason that a decision on this project could not have been made in the first few months of this year. But I tell you, there is logic in putting one and one together and getting two as to why, on budget day of all days, when people are distracted by other things, Mr Albanese and Ms Plibersek quietly, without any announcement to the people of Western Australia, pushed the date for consideration of this project back even further until after the next federal election. I don't know what more is needed for Western Australians to come to the understanding that Mr Albanese and his Labor government have well and truly walked away from WA. As I said, the Labor senators in this place will be given a chance later this evening to stand with the WA federal Liberal senators in standing up for Western Australia and showing their support for gas in our state. Senator Duniam is going to be moving an amendment—it is encapsulated in his second reading amendment and will also be moved in Committee of the Whole—that states the bill's changes to the reconsiderations regime should be substantially strengthened to ensure that all assessments of all projects across all industries do not remain subject to the open-ended review processes that currently exist. In other words, let's make sure that the minister, going forward, cannot in any way revoke a decision that has been made—in particular, in relation to the North West Shelf. I foreshadow that I will also be moving a second reading amendment, to note that the Albanese Labor government has put thousands of Western Australian jobs at risk by delaying the decision on the proposed extension of the Woodside North West Shelf gas project. Key stakeholders, including the Premier of Western Australia, have put on record that Mr Albanese's actions will have a chilling effect on potential investment decisions. This is yet another example of how the Albanese Labor government has walked away from WA and doesn't have the back of Western Australians.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","487","Senator STEELE-JOHN","250156","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The government today seeks to reform our environment laws by amending the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, not for the stronger protection of our natural world but to make it even more difficult for projects that impact our environment to be properly assessed. Australia is in the grip of a biodiversity and climate crisis. This has been clearly evidenced by researchers, experts and academics across the country. Yet today this parliament has before it legislation, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025, that will further undermine our hope of protecting our environment. The major parties in this Senate are satisfied with rushing through this legislation this evening. They are not following the usual process of the Senate and they are not following the process usually taken after a Senate inquiry, leaving no way for a genuine opportunity to assess the impacts of these changes.  How can we trust this government when we consider the history of failed environmental protections in Australia? In the last two centuries, Australia has lost more mammal species than has any other continent. Our biodiversity rate—the rate at which that biodiversity is lost—is considered the second worst in the world. Let me frame that for you again: Australia's environmental protection laws are so weak that we are now a world leader in biodiversity loss. From 2000 to 2017, 7.7 million hectares of native habitat were cleared. Ninety-three per cent of this was cleared without any assessment under our environment laws. Beyond this, billions of animals have been lost to us forever through wildfires. Nineteen irreplaceable marine and land ecosystems around Australia have collapsed. The government cannot say that the cost of this biodiversity loss is unknown. Experts predict that it will quicken the collective collapse of our climate. Our food, our water resources, our economy, our human spaces and our beloved natural world teeter on the very brink. The protective steps, as this government is framing them today, are far from that. The actual protective steps that we need to take today to conscientiously conserve our environment for future generations tomorrow should be the priority of the Senate this evening. The Labor government made a commitment in 2022 to the Australian community to actually reform our environment laws. Not only did they abandon this commitment but the Labor government are now rushing to intervene in a legal process and legislate the exact opposite, against the fulsome assessment of projects under our environmental laws. This is an absurd use of our parliament—to ram through significantly important policy and to gut our environmental laws in less than 48 hours without proper scrutiny or assessment. Australians expect better of their representatives than this. Australians who voted for this government with the assurance that it would strengthen our environmental laws have every right to feel angry and disturbed by what is happening here today. Strong environmental laws are essential to safeguarding our precious lands and our native wildlife and to ensuring the resilience of our food and water resources and of our very communities. We rely on Australia's biodiversity to keep our ecosystems going. It is absolutely astounding that the basic protection of natural ecosystems is being overtly undermined and exploited for the benefit of industries and corporations. What is the point of the EPA and the minister for the environment if genuine challenges and appeals to environmental protections are being shut down by this Labor government? The impact of the Labor government failing to take climate action and environmental commitment seriously is known to our community. Right now in WA, at the end of March, we are experiencing yet another heatwave. At 7 pm on Monday night, Perth was still sweltering through temperatures of 38 degrees. Yet we have the Labor government again siding with the coalition, whose leader has explicitly stated that he would speed through the approvals of Woodside's Burrup Hub, regardless. Just think about it. This is a man who has said he will speed up the approvals of Woodside's Burrup Hub in the full knowledge of the havoc that it will wreak on our climate and vulnerable ecosystems like Scott Reef. It is sadly very simple. If we do not understand and prioritise the rebuilding of a healthy natural world, if we do not make sure that precious places like Scott Reef are preserved, then we will face the consequences in every shape and form in our society. We hear from community members who are doing all they can to decarbonise, to recycle, to manage their waste and to be sustainable in their lives. On the opposing side, we have new gas developments greenlit in New South Wales, for example.

While I live on Wajuk Noongar country, the privilege of serving in this place has connected me to Yawuru, Gija, Yamatji, Bardi Jawi, Ngaanyatjarra and many other wonderful communities. It is a connection that has taught me a profound truth: progress happens when we stop seeing others as strangers and start recognising our common interests and humanity.  In his historic Redfern speech, Paul Keating said: We practised discrimination and exclusion. It was our ignorance and our prejudice. And our failure to imagine these things being done to us. I've got a great-great-great-great-uncle named Alfred Howitt. He led the search party that found Burke and Wills—my mother originates from Victoria—and he witnessed firsthand the consequences of our failure to learn from First Nations people. As Burke lay dying at Cooper Creek, it is well documented today that his racial arrogance prevented him from learning and asking for help from First Australians. Today it is in all of our interests, if we want to live abundant, sustainable lives, to draw on the knowledge of First Nations people—knowledge accrued over six millennia. For me, the gap between Australia's legacy of colonialism and the needs of First Nations people still remains too great. This is important to all of our wellbeing, and for our wellbeing as a nation. The issues confronting First Nations communities cannot be addressed by treating communities as the problem. We can only step forward by listening to the oldest living culture on earth, a culture that has adapted and renewed itself over the last 200 years since colonisation. A failure of imagination, an inability to see our interests align with others, lies at the heart of so many challenges we face, both as individuals and as a society and a nation. I have to say that it was a pleasure to see how we responded to these needs in the Labor budget delivered last night, including cost-of-living relief, climate change, support for families and more. In 2014, when my first term in this place ended, I stood on the other side, six months pregnant with Jasper—hello, Jasper!—giving my valedictory. He's now 10. I became pregnant with you, Jasper, between the 2013 election and the 2014 Senate re-run, after the AEC lost all those ballot papers. It was a very challenging time for me personally on many fronts, but also there was a loss shared by so many of my Labor colleagues. We knew that some of the reasons behind our defeat were of our own making. But we've worked very hard to rebuild and earn the trust of Australians, and we seek to hold that trust secure. Jasper, when I returned to parliament, you were nearly two. I have, in fact, Malcolm Turnbull to thank for my return, because he called a double dissolution election. I remember talking to you, Jasper, about going to work in Canberra again, and you pointed to the sky and said, 'Plane.' I'm pretty sure you thought that coming to Canberra meant that I was literally up in the air in an aeroplane all the time. It did feel that way sometimes. Jasper, I'm enormously proud of you and of our family. I want to thank Dennis and Stephen and my wonderful wife, Bek, for making it possible for me to serve in the Senate for these last nine years. Back in 2001, as a state legislative councillor, I was involved in changing the laws around access to IVF in Western Australia. I was part of campaigns before that time that asked Western Australians not to imagine the wish of de facto couples, single women, including lesbians, as strangers in our desire to have a family. Without that change I would never have had the privilege, Jasper, of being your mother, because you simply wouldn't exist. So I know that you know that the work of parliamentarians is important. The decisions we make in this place matter both in Australia and overseas. But to me, Jasper, you're more important than all of that. I know you're upset about missing your school puppet show tomorrow, but thank you for being at this puppet show with me today. We both experience that feeling of missing out sometimes, and this place, like your puppet show, holds a unique magic—a stage on which to recognise and respond to the many issues affecting Australia and the world, with a new iteration of sometimes old debates every year. I really feel that these past nine years since my return have been incredible, from defending hard-fought Labor reforms in opposition to embracing the opportunities of government—from marriage equality to COVID, from manufacturing to employment, social security, immigration, blocking regressive industrial relations changes and engaging in ever-evolving debates about rights and freedoms. It has been such a great privilege to play a role in these debates and more. The journey to marriage equality was long and deeply personal, as it was for others of us in the chamber, but I was so proud to walk that path alongside so many Australians who demanded fairness and dignity. I hope that my time in this place has shown young queer, LGBTIQ+ Australians that there is a place for them in politics and in shaping our country's future. On that note, Senator Wong, thank you for placing me on the committee that established the guardrails for implementing marriage equality. And it was such a great pleasure to work with you, Senator Dean Smith. We need strong institutions that listen to citizens, and the Senate's capacity to do that is indeed a powerful one. Of course, in this context, Senate committee work is key. When compared to other upper houses, our role in reform through our committees exceeds that of other parliaments around the world. Of course, as I look at the Clerk, I know we could not accomplish this without the hard work and commitment of all of parliament's officers and staff. I thank you and all of the staff here—the clerks, the committee staff, the Black Rod—for your steady moderation of this institution. I also thank security, COMCAR drivers, cleaners, catering staff, the library, building services, the Parliamentary Budget Office and attendants. You all make this place function, despite the tendency of politicians to create chaos by sitting late and engaging in heated debates, as we may well do tonight. We are in a very dynamic place, and, having visited other parliaments, I've seen that the access of civil society, unions, advocates, business, health consumer groups and more to this building, and therefore to power, is such a great asset to our nation. This openness is special. Please protect it. It helps us recognise the issues that are important to the nation. In my time in the Senate, I've seen how we need to face the critical need to break down barriers that make us see the needs of others as strangers unaligned to our own interests. When we see someone who doesn't look like us, sound like us, act like us or love like us, our first instinct is often rooted in fear or judgement. There's a popular quote on TikTok at the moment, from US governor Pritzker. He said: 'We survived as a species by being suspicious of things that we are unfamiliar with.' But he goes on to say: 'This instinct, this animal brain, it limits our potential. When we fail to evolve past these primal urges, our thinking lacks imagination and creativity. Our problem-solving becomes narrow and ineffective, and, most importantly, we miss the opportunity to learn from and connect with the rich diversity of human experience around us.' I have witnessed this throughout my parliamentary career, from the struggle for marriage equality to the recognition of First Nations voices, the fight for transgender rights and the protection of vulnerable Australians from predatory systems like robodebt. In each case, progress only happened when we stopped seeing strangers and started seeing people. I've been reading an essay by Palestinian writer Isabella Hammad. It's titled Recognizing the Stranger. She writes of recognition versus denial. Recognition means acknowledging our shared humanity and the legitimacy of others' experiences, even when they're different from our own. She also goes on to say: 'With recognition must come action.' She commented on the extremity of language from the Israeli government, dehumanising those being bombed—50,000 lives, or more. But as a nation we have citizens with interests on both sides of this conflict. Just as the Berlin Wall fell, apartheid in South Africa ended, and all throughout history great civilisations rise and fall, nothing is in stone. We always have the power and an obligation to look to the future and to shape it with a stranger in mind. I saw the transformative power of recognition firsthand when our party caucus welcomed First Nations voices like Senator Dodson's, Senator McCarthy's, Marion Scrymgour's, Linda Burney's and Jana Stewart's. Our discussions changed fundamentally. Today it feels like we're no longer deliberating on the lives of strangers. We can discuss what is important to us all, and that means a great deal to me. The same principle applies across every domain in life and decision-making. The success of Australia's response to HIV has always meant not treating those affected with stigma or discrimination. Our progress on marriage equality came when Australians recognised that our relationships and families have the same qualities as any other—love, kindness and support. Our strongest public institutions are those that listen to and serve all citizens, not just a privileged few. In saying this, I think particularly of the Fair Work Commission, Medicare, the PBS, the Net Zero Economy Authority and even the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, who are seeking to drive economic investment and opportunity for communities around the nation. My best experiences with colleagues in this place have never focused on our differences. We've always sought to replace fear with curiosity and, in committee work when taking evidence, to ask in a collaborative way with our colleagues, 'What do we need to learn from this person or this evidence?' It's a practical wisdom. As a Senate, we should always keep an eye on the need to reform our institutions when they're out of touch, out of date or leaving people behind so that all voices can be heard. We want public services to be adequately resourced to respond to citizens' needs, where we recognise that no parent should be deprived of a relationship with their child due to poverty and no child should be deprived of basic health care like immunisation here in Australia or overseas—a world where we understand that there can be no strangers among us if we are the truly multicultural nation we claim to be. This is a value in today's day and age, in a complicated world, that we must continue to share, with no stranger to us in Palestine or Israel, just as we were moved to see no strangers in our support for the end of apartheid. Speaking of strangers, transgender Australians have been talked about in this place by some as if they are strangers to citizenship in their own nation. These debates reinforce harmful stereotypes about how men and women should behave and exist in the world, and this ultimately limits all of us—the policing of who's allowed to have a masculine or feminine attribute. It's a ridiculous debate that distracts from the real issues. To address these issues, we need to listen to transgender people and let them speak for themselves. Extreme debates about same-sex parents or marriage equality are no longer the norm. Australians are listening to transgender Australians, just as they did on the calls for marriage equality, and, for us in this place, Australians overall would much prefer politicians to be supporting issues that actually affect their daily lives. They understand that stopping discrimination does not cost money—we can walk and chew gum at the same time—and that these attacks on transgender people undermine the human rights of all. As I leave the Senate, I reflect on what this journey has taught me about the connection between recognition and action, and recognition isn't just an abstract concept; it demands action. Some of the highlights we've seen in this place relate to child migrants, institutional child abuse, the apology to stolen generations and veteran suicide. These are all issues we recognise that we have to respond deeply to. In this context, I'm proud to have stood firmly on the side of transgender rights, sex workers, people living with HIV, vulnerable children, traditional owners and many other people throughout my career, recognising that social and economic exclusion means you need to take action and that taking action doesn't benefit the few; it benefits us all. Deep relationships with brave constituents and advocates have been deeply fulfilling, enriching my understanding and effectiveness as a senator, and from all of these people I have learned a great deal. Justice cannot be sought and found without people speaking for themselves. In issues spanning the Sterling collapse, robodebt, the misuse of Centrepay, dowry abuse, immigration rights, aged care, manufacturing, consumer rights, unions, sex workers, LGBTI health, children's policy and HIV, all of these groups and advocates have been instrumental in my drive for the pursuit of justice and positive change. When we truly see others in their full humanity, we must not be passive. We must not be passive in the face of injustice or indifference. It's wonderful to see how my colleagues in this place understand that recognising issues in our society must compel us to step forward and make a difference. I've tried very hard to embody this principle in my career in this place, and I ask my colleagues who remain in this place to stay brave in your pursuit of justice. Stay curious. Your recognition of what matters to Australia must be paired with the courage to act upon it even when it's difficult. I want to thank Steve McCartney, state secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. It's been a collective effort to build political support for important workplace and income and industry issues. But your leadership is also about recognition and action. Your leadership on a just transition in Collie is showing the rest of the nation what needs to be done. You've taken insecurity and navigated that with recognition and action on issues that others remain in denial on. To the union movement and the ACTU, I'm proud to have been a servant of your movement, our movement, standing up for workers' rights, particularly in my role as chair of the Senate employment committee in the past. Tony, you're doing a sterling job now. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to help the lives, rights and needs of Australian workers so that they be recognised and reformed in this place. To my Labor colleagues, our collective commitment to the common good is a wonderful asset to the nation. Each of us has the great privilege of helping to realise the values of the Labor Party. To my Western Australian colleagues, thank you for standing up for our state and for being great campaigners. It is a privilege to have been entrusted for so many years with the values and opinions of so many thousands of WA Labor members. I want to thank all of those members now for handing out at polling booths, doorknocking and sharing your values and opinions. I particularly want to thank those who handed out back in 2014 on that rainy day when I stood as the only person at the polling booth in Gidgegannup. I want to thank the electors of Western Australia, regardless of how you voted. I hope you feel I have served you well. I particularly and proudly want to thank the broad network of party members who are Rainbow Labor. You've given me tremendous personal support. You have been at the core of what Labor governments have been able to do to support LGBTIQ+ Australians. I will always remember the national conference of 2011, where we changed the platform to support marriage equality as a highlight. I'm going to give a shout-out to Bill Bowtell to thank him for all he's taught me and for his own contribution to the causes we share. I want to express my gratitude to all of those who've made my work possible. I'm very proud to have been part of an Albanese Labor government. In my many years of working with the Prime Minister, I have watched as he has consistently provided stability, made progress and dealt with complexity while keeping sight of the public interest that guides our party. We need leadership with these kinds of navigation skills, and our Prime Minister has them in spades. I've got many colleagues I'd like to thank for the opportunity to contribute to reforms: Bill Shorten, on Centrepay; Tanya Plibersek, on midwifery; Mark Dreyfus, on hate speech, discrimination and more; Senator O'Neill and my colleague from WA Zaneta Mascarenhas, on a commitment to protect people from financial abuse; Mark Butler, on his work on HIV; and Ged Kearney, on LGBTIQ+ health. Julian Hill, we've known each other for some 25 years, and I want to acknowledge the many things we've worked together on, but, more than that, I want to thank you personally for your friendship, drinking tea late at night and sitting in bed like two old nannas. I have a great deal of gratitude for all my colleagues—for all this and more. There are too many other collaborations and outcomes with colleagues right across the parliament to mention at this time, but I thank you all. I have friends and comrades who I thanked in 2013 and who have remained supporters and allies on this journey, and I thank you again without naming you. Many others I'll never have a chance to thank. But I do want to say thank you to Tim Cahalan. Tim asked me to call him a god or something in this speech, but I want to thank you, Tim, as a person with a disability, for your visibility and voice in our party and for standing up against robodebt. Your perspective and advocacy have strengthened the collective work of our movement. Our party is always more effective with diverse voices at the table so we can recognise and respond to what's important. I depart knowing that this place is brimming with talent and dedicated Labor ministers, who share my values, and it makes it easier to leave. I don't feel the need to be on the stage in the next iteration of debates. It does make it much easier to leave. That stage will soon include Ellie Whiteaker, the first female secretary of Western Australia Labor in our more than 100-year history, who is ready to carry the torch. Ellie in fact worked with me in the past in my office, and I want to thank all my staff for all they have done: spending time helping constituents, listening to people on the phone, strategising with me, giving me sound advice and keeping me organised. You've delivered a great deal to constituents on issues and things that have affected them and that I will never even know of. Nicky McKimmie, thank you. Alison Elgar, thank you. Jaime Page, thank you. Avery Wright, thank you. Tania McCartney, we've worked together a very long time, and I thank you. I want to thank all of those who have worked with me since I was first elected to the state parliament, in 2001. Your loyalty, dedication, shared commitment to justice, and agency on issues of importance to us are just as important as mine. Ashley, Andy, Alanna, Jon, Kate and Justine, just to mention a few from the past—and Nicki Slevin is up there, too—I've worked with some of you for such a long time, and, long after our work together has ended, our friendships are strong. Finally, to my wife, Bek, thank you for marrying me on 4 June 2003. Thank you to my mother, Sandra; my father, Greg; and my siblings, Nicholas and Fleur. Thank you for making it possible for me to serve and for being there when politics was tough. Whether in this place or anywhere else in our nation, the work we do when we recognise our shared humanity lifts us all up. It elevates us above our animal instincts, above our fears and prejudice and into a place where we can see further and find solutions. So, to all of those I have worked with and made friends with in this place, please do not be a stranger. I still want to look to new horizons with you. Looking to the future, I will draw on my values to help me recognise my next endeavour, whatever that is to be. But I know in the meantime I'm looking forward to school pick-ups, to not missing Jasper's school events and to being home for dinner with Bek and Jasper more often. I thank you all for the privilege of serving in this Senate.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","492","Senator WONG","00AOU","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I think Senator Pratt is still farewelling people, but if she doesn't mind I might just make some brief remarks. Louise is one of those people who leave this place with as much commitment to principle as they arrived with and with as much optimism as they arrived with, which is not always the case. Louise, your service has been marked by dedication to key causes and campaigns. Louise Pratt has always been an activist politician in the true sense of that term, pushing the boundaries for change. Through her service, she has sought to amplify the concerns of, address the needs of and, most importantly, bear witness to the perspective and experience of those who are marginalised. We saw that again tonight.  No tribute to Louise would be complete without emphasising her contribution to marriage equality in this country in 2017. It probably says something about our age that that is still something we remember really clearly. We talk to younger members of the LGBTIQ community, and not everybody knows all of the history, and it was a hard history. It was politically hard, it was hard internally, and it was really hard for us personally because it was about our families. And Louise knows, more than anyone else, the years—actually, I think it was over a decade—of work it involved, including community activism and political organising inside the party and with community. She was integral to that. For some people from the outside looking in, they thought that the journey began in the mid-2010s and lasted for a couple of years before we came to the inevitable and obvious conclusion that equality wasn't something to be frightened of, but I think some of us—Louise and others—know differently. I want to say here, very clearly, that Louise Pratt was at the vanguard of that advocacy for equality, and she has been all her life, not only in here but also before she arrived here, as a student, in the Western Australian parliament and in her community activism. She pushed boundaries to get marriage equality on the agenda. I had forgotten this but, with Trish Crossin, Gavin Marshall and Senator Brown, Louise introduced the bill in 2012. A few of us voted for it; it didn't get up. That's okay. We had to come back again. Louise and others set up the cross-party working group to advance the cause, and, of course, there was the campaign inside the Labor Party to change our position, which was critical to achieving the final outcome. The pivotal select committee that Louise spoke of, chaired by Senator Fawcett—and that, I think, Senator Smith was on—that considered the issue over the summer of 2016-17 laid the groundwork for the legislative success. I think you described it as 'guardrails', and I think that's a very accurate way of talking about it. Over this journey, Louise and I played different roles at times, and that was important, but we were united when it came to the desired outcome. There's a great photo of us watching the announcements of the postal survey, and we're together in that. There's a great photo of us in here celebrating the bill being passed, and we were also together then. There are many thousands of Australians who, since that time—and there will be more into the future—have been able to make the decision to marry the person they love, as a result of the work of so many, and Louise was one of the torchbearers for a long time. At times, that was lonely. She kept the flame alight for many years. I think we saw tonight, again, an example of her undisputed commitment to equality and to human rights. She never relents in her advocacy—including with me at times—on many issues far and wide. She has been quite active in parliamentary friends and has been a leader and supporter of Gavi, the worldwide vaccine alliance. She's been one of the two people who have been the driving force behind the World AIDS Day parliamentary breakfast. She's never changed her view about what matters. She also doesn't shy away from a tough discussion about economic inequality. I think people may not see, all the time, the extent to which Louise is a policy head. She really is; she's somebody who looks at the detail of policy and comes to her views having thought through the policy issue very clearly. She's a vocal advocate for industry policy and, obviously, a member of the AMWU. She's a longstanding supporter of workers' rights, and her shadow portfolios reflected that over her career. I was trying to think about how to talk about this, and I thought, really, the most honest way of saying this is that you're not a cookie-cutter politician. Whether it's the quirky Halloween outfits, which to me—I have looked at some of the photos Louise has sent me and thought, 'Oh, my goodness, I don't think I could ever wear that, ever.' You have so much fun! But, also, there's the way you think outside of the square in the way you approach this job and so much else. I talked at the beginning about your optimism, and that's an inseparable part of who you are. It is a real tribute to you that, after years of being here, you still have that. We see people who leave this place or who come to this place who do not have that trait. You really do, and we are the better for both your optimism and your compassion. Senator Louise Pratt leaves this Senate articulating the same compassion that has been the hallmark of her career, and she leaves it with the same optimism which is the hallmark of who she is. I know that Louise has a desire to contribute elsewhere. I know she will bring the same energy and dedication to this next phase of her life that she has brought to so many areas of passion during her time as a senator. To her family, particularly to Bek, I'm sure it will be good to have her back more. But I want to say to you, Jasper—I hope you know it now—I hope that in years to come you will come to understand even more how much your mum has contributed to a better world and community for you. You should be very proud, as we are.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","493","Senator URQUHART","231199","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I rise to make a small contribution to this valedictory for Louise. Louise was here when I first arrived in the Senate, and I can remember back in, I think, October 2014 when Jasper was born. I was in Western Australia for a committee hearing, and I thought, 'Oh, Louise has had her baby; I might see if I can visit her.' That was a terrible thing to do; he was two days old! But, of course, I rang Louise because I had to see this beautiful baby, and she said yes. I've always taken an interest in Jasper and watched how he's grown and all his activities. When Louise was the deputy whip, we used to sit here a lot—I'm telling a few secrets now—and watch little videos of what Jasper was doing at home at the time. Last year Louise talked to me about this new puppy that they had and how the puppy had chewed his teddy, so I got to work with my knitting needles and knitted Jasper a new teddy. I hope you've still got it, Jasper!  Anyway, we've worked really closely on committees, supported each other as senators but also as whips here for some time—I haven't added up the months and years but always enjoyed that—and spent many hours here together in the chamber. Lou is an AMWU comrade. She's a very kind, gentle and compassionate person and a very hard worker. I have watched how she works really hard. Lou is the only person in the Senate I know who has their own electrical and communications substation under their desk. It is uniquely Lou. If anyone sat at her desk during a division, they'd know what I mean, and I'm sure it's still hooked up there somewhere. It is uniquely her. I don't think anyone else could get away with that in the Senate chamber, but Lou certainly has. Lou, I want to wish you all the very best wherever your next chapter takes you, and I know that you'll continue to make a really valuable contribution wherever that leads you. So congratulations and best wishes.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","494","Senator McALLISTER","121628","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I also wish to make a brief contribution to the valedictory. I met Louise, I think, in 1996, but it is so long ago now that it is quite hard to establish the precise date. But it means that I have seen Louise's contribution to progressive politics over a very long time. It began long before she came to this place and has continued throughout your time here as a senator, Louise, and I imagine it will continue for quite some time after as well. You began your career in community activism and you've never truly stopped, and that's brought you to a wide range of issues, some of which you talked about in your speech just now, but not all of them. I observed your interest in climate change, an area where we have both been active; in economic justice; and, of course, in human rights.  Being an advocate requires bravery, and Louise has that in spades. She has been a strong voice for views that at the time were neither popular nor common but have since been vindicated by history. She was the youngest woman ever elected to the Western Australian Legislative Council in 2001. At that time, she was appointed to a ministerial committee on gay and lesbian law reform, and the report from that committee informed the landmark reforms that the WA government made the following year. They included a complete ban on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; the granting of the right for same-sex couples to adopt children; a lowering of the age of consent from 21 to 16; the right for same-sex couples to inherit from a deceased partner; and the repeal of legislation which had made it an offence to promote homosexuality in schools. These were important reforms, and the reformist drive that you brought to that process you have continued in your other work here. You've been an important formal contributor to this chamber as a shadow minister, a deputy whip and a committee chair. Just as important have been the informal contributions that Louise has made as a tireless advocate for workers' rights, for women's rights and for climate and the environment. Louise exemplifies the connection between these issues that is found within Labor and the understanding that solidarity between workers extends to solidarity with other people who endure injustice. Your interest in building the bonds between those groups of people and making progress is something that I think has been a very important feature of the way that you've worked and the contribution you've made to the labour movement and to the community. I know, because they talk to me about it, that there is a generation of young queer Labor activists for whom Louise has been an immensely important example. If you can't see it, you can't be it. You have been vocal and courageous in taking on discrimination and injustice wherever you have seen them. You have organised across the party for decades, bringing together unionists, activists, NGOs and other parties too. You've provided encouragement and mentorship to decades of staff and party organisers inside and outside the building, including within Rainbow Labor. I know that there are many people who have been participants at different times in Rainbow Labor who would acknowledge the role that you played in supporting many, many different people who sought to be active within that movement. Senator Wong talked a little bit about the campaign for marriage equality. I cannot do it as well as Penny does, but this was a campaign that was conducted in the community, within the Labor Party and the labour movement and ultimately in this parliament. And it is a wonderful thing, in the years since that important legislative reform, that so many people we know have been able to marry the people they love. I know that those who have followed this debate will understand that this outcome is the product of years of advocacy. There were people within Labor who built the coalition for change within the Labor Party, within the trade union movement, with the community. There were people who campaigned within Labor, conference after conference, and, as Senator Wong has acknowledged, you were at the centre of that and it wasn't always easy. You were there, putting the case respectfully, but firmly. Once we had changed our position we created space for further political movement. That non-binding plebiscite asked a lot of the campaigners, particularly those who were willing to speak about their own experiences and speak about their own families to create that connection with others in the community, to make the case with dignity, equality and recognition. It is to your great credit, Louise, that you were so important in that, and it is one that I know many others recognise and for which you should be very, very proud. I want to say what an entirely decent, compassionate comrade and friend you've been to me, and I know you have also been to others in the building. This can be a place where if something difficult is happening at home it can be a little lonely, and I have absolutely drawn on your support at different times. I thank you for your kindness, compassion and empathy on a couple of occasions when I really needed someone to listen. I was so grateful for that. And finally, I simply want to say to Dennis, Steve, Bek and Jasper, you are getting Louise back. Thank you for sharing her with us for all of this time. Louise, we wish you the very best in all that is to come.

I was very impressed by this amazing young woman who was outspoken and really active. It was at some community event. I seem to think it was the MUA picket line, but I don't think that quite marries up. Nevertheless, I was very impressed with this young woman who just appeared from nowhere.  In Western Australia, you are a well-known and well-loved member of the Labor Party. You have many followers and, even though 'cherished' is not really a word you associate with politics, you are cherished by the WA members of the Labor Party. We, of course, are members of the Left faction. We have really fought hard in WA to make sure that there are progressive policies in the Labor Party. You have been a very strong advocate for the metal workers union, and for other unions as well, and for people down on their luck. You really pushed on the Sterling First financial crash when probably no-one else did. You took that on and continued to be a champion of that. Louise has always told us when Steve's in town we have to turn up, and we always do. I know that you'll be missed in this place. I wish you all the best. I'm really keen to see what you go on to do next. I know you will continue to be a strong advocate for WA and a strong advocate for the Left of the party and for the industrial movement.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","496","Senator WALSH","252157","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I too rise to make a short contribution about my friend Senator Louise Pratt. Lou, your passion for equality and inclusion has been really clear in your contribution tonight, just as it has been clear in your work for the Australian people so far, and it has been really clear in the contributions of the leader and others who have spoken here today. But I just wanted to comment on my experience of your commitment to inclusion here in this place, which has been so incredibly valuable to me.  In my time in the Senate, Lou has been one of the most inclusive and supportive people around. For all of us on this side of the chamber—and I hope across the chamber as well—she has brought a bit of joy every day to this place for many of us. She has brought a flash of colour, some vibrancy, and a lot of humour and warmth, which we heard in your contribution tonight as well. And you have brought all of that to a place that, let's face it, can be a little bit cold and hard without everything that you bring, and we've all been much better for that. Lou has been here a bit longer than me. I arrived here in 2019, and, from the day that I arrived, Lou was 100 per cent welcoming and 100 per cent supportive. It's a pretty tough place to land in. I had a lot of questions when I arrived here, as we all do, and there was never any question that was too big or too small for you, Lou, and I really appreciate that. I will always remember that. Lou is the type of political advocate and the type of person who is always ready to reach a hand out and a hand up to bring everyone along together, and we heard that in your remarks tonight. It's really important that women support other women. Lou has always done that both in her advocacy and in her real-world practice. I know that Lou really knows, practises and demonstrates that, when women support other women, we all do better together; we do better as women in our party; we do better as women in our parliament as a whole; and we do better as women in our country. Lou has also been the type of political leader here and in Western Australia who has chosen to use her platform not just to advance herself but to empower others and to give voice to others. I know that LGBTQIA Australians know they have a true friend and in Louise from all of the work that she described today—from reproductive health and the hard-fought campaign for marriage equality through to the incredibly important advocacy for trans Australians. That should not be required in this place and should not be required in this country today, but is required today. I particularly acknowledge the work, Lou, that you've done in supporting young trans people, who really need love and support today. You have that love and support, and you deliver it in absolute bucketloads and in boundless ways. Lou is also just as passionate about the Labor movement and the union movement. I also acknowledge the AMWU and Steve McCartney, here today. I acknowledge Lou's long advocacy for manufacturing workers and for women workers, including vulnerable women workers, like sex workers, who you spoke about tonight. I know that everyone that you fought for really thanks you for your advocacy. To Beck and Jasper; Lou's mum, Sandra; as well as Dennis and Stephen, I hope you're all as proud of Louise as all of us here. A life lived in service of others is a life well lived. A life in service of our great Labor movement is a life well lived, and Louise has made a tremendous contribution. I'm really proud, Lou, to have worked alongside you. I'm proud to call you a comrade and a sister in our movement. I'm proud to call you a friend. I and all of us will really miss you. We will miss all of the chats in the chamber. We will miss the laughs. We really look forward to watching your next big strides that I know you will take to empower Australians and continue your really fantastic work on behalf of all Australians. Thank you, Lou.

I also want to note that my colleague Senator Barbara Pocock thinks you're a wonderful chair for the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. We both want to thank you for the warm and welcoming way in which you worked with us when we first came to the parliament as new senators. Jasper, I want to thank you for your love of capybaras because, without that and your mum's persistence, I would never have seen a capybara in the wild. You're a fantastic travelling companion.

Before I came here, your reputation preceded you to me as well, as someone with great courage and conviction to strive for what is right and get outcomes. You might not remember this, but we did first meet a bit less than a decade ago, I think, when we were both involved with the national committee of EMILY's List. Jess spoke about women supporting women, and you absolutely lived your values through EMILY's List, and we crossed paths there for a short time. You had baby Jasper in tow at a particular meeting in Melbourne that I was at, and I remember being so impressed back then, about how you managed everything—be such an amazing activist for women, undertake the important role in politics you played, be a community activist and find the time for EMILY's List, all while juggling your new little one.  You travelled from Perth to be in Melbourne in your own time, at your own expense, for national meetings with everything else that you had on your plate. You were just the kind of role model that has inspired so many, as others have said. Never did I imagine that I would become your bench buddy so many years later. Whilst we haven't been parliamentary colleagues for very long at all, I want to thank you for your kindness and generosity as we've sat here over the many hours in the months that I've been here, and for your generosity in helping me to navigate the weird, confusing and sometimes scary things as we sit on these red seats. I can confirm that the little space station down here still exists, but there are many useful things that have helped me over the last few months. You've demystified many things, at many times, and provided a quiet word or some steadying encouragement—as a new senator, one sometimes gets a bit overwhelmed. You have really gone out of your way to help me settle in, and I think you were the first one to use the little phone under the desk to call my office and help me get some notes when I was in a particular flap at one point in time. Your contribution has been extraordinary. I wish you all the best and I say thank you to your family and friends for sharing Louise with all of us.

To Lou's family, particularly Jasper, it's nice to have been on this journey with Louise long enough to remember her with that beautiful bump, and her delight and joy in moving around the place and sharing the pregnancy with all of us, as a working mum, and then the many, many times that I've travelled with her to places far and wide, often in the northern parts of Western Australia, and experienced her joy in reconnecting with her family. Jasper, she's such a fun person. I know that, and I see her having such fun with you, and I know that you'll be absolutely delighted to have her back with you at home. I have had the privilege, perhaps more than any of the other contributors here, to work very, very closely with Senator Pratt on so many important pieces of work that we've done, both in opposition and now, more recently, in government.  Personally, I want to thank you for your time sharing with me your insights as an assistant minister, when I took on the role as shadow assistant for mental health and for innovation. That was profoundly personally helpful, and I think the stories that we're hearing from everybody show that, somehow, Louise Pratt has a homing beacon for finding people at a moment where there's a learning opportunity for them to pick up on her wisdom and her insight, but it's just this feeling of kindness. When everybody forgets everything that you do, what you produce and what you create, if the last thing that they remember about you is how kind you were, you're in that club. I believe that is part of why you have been so successful as a senator. What's driven Louise is not personal interest, not professional path-making to a particular personal end but a deep and abiding belief in people who have been done wrong. I would put it in the Christian tradition, the language that brings me to this place. The option for the poor in theology is manifestly obvious in you. What we see through the work in the corporations and financial services committee is Louise's determination. I see Senator Scarr here, who has been your partner in profound endeavour on behalf of people who were unbelievably exploited by financial instruments that were established determinedly to exploit people in the Sterling matter. People talk about a dog with a bone or say, 'She was like a terrier,' but that is about the explosive energy of keeping on going, and you certainly have that. But Louise has a very secret weapon, and it is this very deep and authentic sense of her responsibility as a servant of the nation in this place to stand up for people who have no-one else to stand for them. Thank you for your remarkable contribution. She's a serious person, but she's also incredibly funny. I hope that you have a wonderful time in the years that follow your contribution to the Australian nation through your role here in the Senate. Thank you.

I'm deeply appreciative of the opportunity to do this valedictory speech tonight, to have the opportunity to reflect on the things that I'm so proud to have delivered in this place, and to thank the many people—many of whom are here tonight—who have helped me along the journey.  I'm also very grateful to be leaving the Senate at a time of my own choosing—an opportunity I'm very well aware not all members and senators have. But let me be very clear about one thing. While I am leaving at a time of my choosing, the timing of my choosing has been expedited by events that are well known to all in this place. Those events have inflicted deep wounds on so many. However, my wounds do not define who I am. They have not distracted me for a second from what I was elected to do here as a senator and member, but they have made me stronger and they have made me wiser. More on that later. None of us succeed in this place on our own. We are at our best in this place when we collaborate to deliver meaningful and important reforms for our nation. It is a real shame that more Australians don't get to see this dirty little secret of ours about how much we do actually work together across the aisle in this place. I've got so many people to thank, which I will do at the end. But I do have a few acknowledgements upfront. Foremost is to my family—my partner, Robert; my father, Laith; my brother Andrew, his partner, Angela, and his daughters, Octavia and Anastasia; and my mother, Jan, who is so desperately sad that she could not be here tonight but is watching from home in Perth. To you, Mum, I say thank you. I love you. But I am somewhat comforted that my brother Cameron and his wife, Charlotte, and his two daughters, Olivia and Sophie, will be with her this evening. As senators, we choose this life, but our families are conscripts. I think it's safe to say that it's never really been that easy to be related to me. What those opposite did to me was so brutal and so deliberate, but they also did it to my family and my partner. For that, I am so deeply sorry that my career choice has done so much damage to those that I love the most. I'm also more grateful than I could ever express that so many friends, staff and colleagues are here tonight, and I know many more are watching online. I've received the photos of the screen on with the glasses of wine in front.

I'm so deeply grateful that year after year you have kept showing up to support me and be my friend. My staff are simply spectacular, but I'll have much more to say about you a bit later on.  My journey into the Senate was not a particularly smooth one. In 2012, after long and successful careers in both the Army and the Liberal Party, I was deeply honoured to be preselected by the WA Liberal Party as a Senate candidate. Service defines who I am and what I do, and it always will. In my early 20s, I found my philosophical and ideological roots in the Liberal Party, as well as lifelong friends, many of whom are in the chamber here and also in the gallery this evening. I am a Menzies Liberal. I draw on both philosophical traditions of our great party. I'm as comfortable with supporting same-sex marriage as I am with boat turn-backs and rearming our nation in preparation for war. I've never been a member of a party faction. I understand them, but I find them distracting and often destructive. I left the Army as the adjutant general, the senior governance adviser with responsibility for reforming the Army's compliance and assurance processes to ensure capability and the safety of our people. So, after 35 years of military and political service, I felt very well prepared to serve my state and my country in the Senate, but it almost was not to be. After the great excitement of being elected in 2013, the election was voided by the High Court, as the AEC had lost the princely sum of 1,375 ballot papers; Senator Cash remembers that well. As third on our Senate ticket, I almost lost in the 2014 Senate election rerun. I was then referred to in the media as 'one of the unluckiest people in Australian politics'. I've got to say, after the experience of the past four years, one could be forgiven for thinking that maybe they were right, but nothing—nothing—could be further from the truth. Being elected to serve in the Senate is such a rare privilege—a privilege that comes with great responsibilities but also great opportunities to do wonderful things for our nation. I've never lost sight of that—not once, not ever. Since Federation, I'm the 569th of only 648 Australians who have served in this place. I'm the 87th of 125 women, the 90th Western Australian and the fifth Liberal woman from Western Australia to have served in the Senate. At the last election in 2019, I had the great privilege of leading the WA party's Senate ticket. In my first speech—at that bookend—I focused on the themes of democracy, of leadership, of change and of gender. They were all causes that I have consistently and passionately pursued in this place both as a senator and as a minister. In that first speech, I also reflected on the values that underpinned my approach to life and to work, the dominant value being respect, which I learnt from my parents very early in life: self-respect, respect for others, and respectful compassion and support for those who genuinely need it, but also respectful but tough actions against those who ruthlessly exploit the compassion and the vulnerability of others and against those who seek to do us harm. On reflection, the most important lesson I take away from this place is the need to constantly recalibrate your own moral compass. We must be vigilant in here in ensuring it remains always pointing true north. I have Army to thank for instilling this practice in me. Constantly doing so has made it possible for me to navigate through some of the most challenging circumstances, and it has made complex moral decisions far easier. It also made the challenging issue of leadership challenges—three of which I went through—a relative breeze. My motto was: 'You always support the leader, unless there is serious misconduct.' And if you support the leader, you walk with them to the spill. I'm proud I walked twice with the leader, but today, on reflection, I must confess I have some degree of buyer's remorse for the second. Since my early 20s, I've worked in this building in very many different capacities, so when I came in I really thought I had a good handle on what to expect as a senator. However, the past 11 years have far exceeded my initial expectation in so many really wonderful and often challenging ways. I've had the privilege to serve in two constitutional roles: in the legislature and in executive government—and I'll address each in turn. But there was never any doubt in my mind that, if I was going to put my hand up for federal parliament, it would be for the Senate. I have such a deep respect for the Senate and its role in maintaining the strength and stability of our democracy. But it was in the committees that I found my greatest joy and purpose in the Senate. I counted it up—actually, one of my staff members counted it up—and I've been a member of 30 different committees, many of them on multiple occasions. I've chaired and deputy chaired seven and participated in hundreds of inquiries. I'm proud of all the inquiries and the reports that I've put my name to, but sometimes you're a little prouder of some than others. I think in this place we always have that moment where we realise the power that we possess to champion causes and change so many lives for the better. There are no topics off limits for senators, but we do have to choose which ones we pursue and for how long we pursue them. Now, that realisation came to me when I learned that thousands of young Australians with serious and permanent disabilities were forced to live in aged care. There was simply nowhere else for them to live. I'm so proud that the result of the inquiry, the report itself, was implemented. It has taken time, but thousands upon thousands of those people are now living with support and dignity in the community. In fact, my very last committee report was tabled today. It was the second community affairs committee inquiry into tick bite diseases. I had promised former senator Rachel Siewert at her own valedictory that I would continue the fight for justice for the thousands of Australian victims of tick bites who are so disgracefully and shamefully treated by the medical profession. I now ask my fellow senator, Senator Kovacic, to take on the challenge and to keep the fight going for those people. Sometimes, as well, issues just come across your desk—ones that you actually know very little about, but when you look at them, you just know there is something not right; there is something a little bit stinky. One such issue was the sudden axing of the Western Force club from Super Rugby by the Australian Rugby Union. This devastated fans, players, their families and their club. Now, I couldn't even identify a rugby ball—sorry, some of my friends up there, but I still can't after all these years. They were completely devastated. They could not understand why it happened, so, as the sport was partially federally funded, I sponsored a Senate inquiry. We did get answers for fans and the team, but unfortunately the Australian Rugby Union was never held accountable for their many quite questionable actions that sat behind that reason. Committees in this place can also lead us to very unexpected places. Over time—I'm sure like all of my colleagues here—I came to realise that sometimes solving or addressing some of the issues that we deal with goes well beyond our own national borders. For me, one such issue is tackling modern slavery. This is a crime that exists not just overseas; it is hidden in plain sight right across Australia. As a Liberal, there is no more important freedom for us to fight for than the freedom from slavery and servitude. As a direct result of my work in this place on tackling trafficking and slavery, I now lead global reforms on child trafficking and forced labour, particularly orphanage trafficking. This journey began in 2016 with two parliamentary study programs. The first was a CPA UK sponsored parliamentary education program for Commonwealth MPs on how to tackle modern slavery in legislation. The second was a Save the Children parliamentary study tour to Cambodia. This is where I learned that Australian donors, donors from many other countries and volunteers had inadvertently created a trade in children to satisfy their need and desire to help poor children. It's hideous. But the inquiry report that we initiated when we returned, called Hidden in a plainsight, recommended the introduction of modern slavery legislation in Australia. Significantly, the report also recognised orphanage trafficking as a form of modern slavery, and we were the first country to do so. One of the proudest moments in my ministerial career was when, as the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, I carried the legislation through the parliament. Since that time, I've worked on developing global partnerships to implement global reforms to stop orphanage trafficking and to reunite over five million children who've been trafficked back with their families. These efforts are coordinated through the orphanage trafficking working group that I chair at a DC based inter-parliamentary taskforce on human trafficking. I'm in this for the long haul. Unfortunately in this speech I can't completely avoid dealing, at least in part, with what I now refer to as 'the plan'. I have never disputed, not once, Brittany Higgins's claim about what happened in my office in the early hours of one Saturday morning. Brittany Higgins and David Sharaz developed a political #MeToo plan based on a simple but very powerful lie—a lie that has now resulted in the longest and largest political scandal in our nation's history and one that is well into its fifth year. Brittany always knew the truth. Justice Lee dealt with this in his judgement, where he sets out the false representations and false warranties given in her settlement deed. Justice Lee said, 'What is notable about Ms Higgin's account of a cover-up or victimisation allegation is not only its inconsistency with the contemporaneous records and its falsities, particularly as to Ms Higgins's dealings with Ms Brown but also its imprecisions and reliance upon speculation and conjecture.' He also said: … putting what occurred at this meeting— on 1 April— and the events of the preceding days together, a clear picture emerges, but it is entirely at odds with the notion of an attempt being made to cover up an allegation … by discouraging it to be reported to the police. The moment Labor's leadership made the conscious decision to politically weaponise Ms Higgins's allegations, my life and the lives of so many others were changed forever. Every human being, no matter how strong they are, has a breaking point. Labor deliberately and so very surgically and relentlessly found mine—whatever it took. That type of persistent and aggressive personal attack would never be tolerated in any other workplace in this country. Labor so badly wanted the allegations that a female cabinet minister and a prime minister had covered up the rape of a young woman to be true that they didn't actually care if it was true or not, I believe. Consequently, as a result of their actions, Labor failed to exercise any proper judgement or independence before becoming so publicly involved in perpetuating a story that Justice Lee described as 'insufficiently scrutinised and factually misconceived conjecture'. I never wanted to sue Brittany or David, but ultimately I was left with no choice. I've been asked why I did it. Once the Attorney-General barred me from defending these highly defendable workplace allegations, he left me with no other alternative but to fight for the truth and for justice under defamation law. The Commonwealth's conduct in the swift settlement with Brittany sent a clear and very unequivocal message to the nation that these demonstrable lies were in fact true. This enabled me to continue to be grossly defamed. As a senator in this place, I had to fight for my and my staff's and my family's reputation. People ask why, but if in the Senate, in this chamber, we don't fight for truth and justice, where on earth in Australia do we fight for it? I had no choice. Of course I had to fight. Once Justice Tottle has delivered his judgement then I will have a lot more to say about this. However, I conclude on this matter by saying this: in the next parliament, it is my great hope that all parties can come together to agree on how we set the standard in this place and calibrate it so it is the same standard that we legislate for every other workplace in this country. To do that, to set the standard, those in this chamber—not 'we'; it won't be 'we' anymore—will have to agree on where robust and privileged debate finishes and where inappropriate workplace behaviours and bullying starts. The abuse of parliamentary privilege is no longer acceptable. Scott Morrison appointed me to several portfolios over his tenure as Prime Minister, and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities that he gave me: emergency management, defence industry, Defence, the NDIS and government services. Scott and I spent much time together in 2019 and 2020, visiting a range of natural disasters across this country, and what I saw in him was a leader who had great empathy and demanded decisive action for those in urgent need. What he saw in me then as emergency management minister he also saw in me as defence minister. We may have had our differences on occasion, but when I collapsed in this place Scott rushed over to the anteroom and he was so incredibly kind. He sat with me for over an hour while I was sobbing hysterically and completely incoherently. He sat there, he looked after me and, throughout my recovery, he stayed in contact with me and my doctor. When others were baying for my head he kept me in cabinet, which gave me a new purpose. It gave me a new challenge and it gave me hope. What happened to me also happened to him and to his family. He was also a target of the plan, of the lie. So, Scott, I thank you for your service to the nation and for your stewardship of this nation through the COVID-19 pandemic. Your leadership and the decisions you took saved tens of thousands of Australian lives, millions of jobs and thousands and thousands of companies. I thank you for that. It was an extraordinary time in these portfolios, but time doesn't permit me to address them all tonight. Scott and I had a shared understanding of what our nation needed for its defence, and together we delivered it: a defence strategic update and an accompanying force structure plan; the budget to fund it; new agreements with the United States. I signed an agreement with NATO. And, with some of the people in the chamber tonight, we set this country on the pathway towards nuclear submarines. I came into the Defence portfolio well prepared after a long career in the Army as a senior officer, having worked at higher headquarters and having completed a master's in strategic studies at the War College. It was very clear to both Scott and me that we were facing a higher risk and a rapidly changing strategic landscape, the worst since World War II. Not long after becoming the minister, I gave a keynote speech at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC. I started with the observation that the rules based order we had lived in since the end of World War II was no more and was not coming back. Sadly, that has proved to be true. Alarmingly, the threat has only increased since then. That is due in large part to not just China but the new axis of convenience—China, Russia, North Korea and Iran. The brutal reality we very rarely discuss in this place is that we have a four-nation axis of dictatorship and authoritarianism that has a shared enemy, and that is democracy and that is us. This axis is rapidly expanding its political and military spheres of influence. All these regimes have nuclear capabilities. They exert brutal control over their citizens, they have no regard for human life and they have a shared hatred of democratic values. This axis has already progressed from non-kinetic to kinetic war in two theatres of war—Russia in Ukraine and Iran in Israel and the Red Sea, with the support of proxies Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. I acknowledge the Ukrainian ambassador, who joins us here this evening. He has been an astonishing advocate for his nation. I am in complete awe of the work you do for the family and the friends that you have lost yourself and for seeing your country under such relentless attack. I acknowledge the bravery of the Ukrainian people. As I've said many times in this place, their war is our war. Absolutely, their war is our war, and we need to be doing far more to help Ukraine defeat Russia. I know there are a lot of discussions going on globally at the moment, but, as I said in here in a much longer speech, appeasement of Russia will not work. The United States appeased Russia 10 years ago and gave them Crimea: 'They won't take anything more'—until they did. It's not just Russia. China has a vice-like grip on the South China Sea and is well advanced in its preparations to cross the Taiwan Strait. North Korea continues to advance its nuclear and long-range strike capabilities. They are providing ballistic missiles to Russia and are gazing oh-so-longingly over the DMZ. What this axis have over us at the moment is they understand the benefits of shared industrial and military alliances and materiel alliances to achieve what they cannot on their own—and they're not just doing it as the four of them anymore. They're doing it with many BRICS members, who are not even hedging their bets anymore; they've just jumped ship. As a Western Australian senator, I've been aware for many years that China has been quietly and persistently manipulating critical minerals and rare-earth commodity markets globally. They've done this to stockpile offtake and monopolise processing. This, combined with the CCP's prolific use of slave, forced and bonded labour, provides China with an overwhelming economic advantage in the new energy technology sectors. This is something that those opposite know only too well, but it is inconceivable that anybody in this nation would choose a solar panel, a wind turbine or an electric vehicle over human life. We have to find ways in this place to deal with both—to stand up for human life while we transition to net zero. Robert Menzies observed in one of his many 'Forgotten people' speeches that Australians take a great many things for granted, which I think was just as true then, in 1942, as it is now. One of the most important things we take for granted is the health of our democracy. We have forgotten as a nation what it takes to preserve and strengthen our democracy. How do we strengthen the institutions that prop up our democracy? But I don't yet see a catalyst for change. That is one of the next things—it's unfinished business for me—that we need to review. In both my military and my civilian career, I've not just had command positions but led three successive reform projects that deliver change, and change that has stuck. I know that change is never easy, but it is always possible. During COVID-19, we, in this place, and the government demonstrated that we can do things quickly. We can get things done quickly. We can create vaccines. We can get the public servants to get money out the door the next day. We can do things, but, if identifying problems was an Olympic sport, Australia would lead the gold medal tally. We have endless royal commissions, we have inquiries, we have reviews, and we inquire into hundreds of issues every year in this place, but the recommendations are rarely, if ever, fully implemented—if at all. Being deputy chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I know that every single report, for decades, has said the same things over and over. We make policy and we implement legislation, but little of it actually gets implemented effectively. I'm a transformative conservative; I'm not a radical one. There's a lot of discussion and debate, particularly in the United States, about this at the moment. I don't believe that the radical destruction of the status quo will automatically result in the delivery of better outcomes. It will certainly tear down underperforming institutions, but we need more than that. We need a plan for how we rebuild. For what we cut or what we remove, how we are actually going to make what we replace it with far more efficient and effective with the taxpayers' money? I will finish off with a couple of ministerial observations. One of the greatest joys of my time in this place was being Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The NDIS is a fundamentally Liberal insurance scheme. It is not a welfare scheme. It is designed to help provide Australians with the most serious and permanent disabilities the dignity and the ability to realise their own life choices and aspirations. But that is not the scheme it is today. My greatest regret, as the Minister for the NDIS, is that four years ago I was unable to convince Bill Shorten and Labor to work with me and the government to reform the serious structural problems that has made it unsustainable. There were no shortcuts then, and there are even fewer four years later. The fundamental problem is that, as an insurance scheme, the Commonwealth government is powerless to control either lever of the insurance scheme: the number of participants and the cost per participant. Until we can get control of that and the intergovernmental agreements are completely reformed, this scheme, unfortunately, is on a trajectory to failure, and that would probably be the biggest public policy failure of our generation. So, after the election, all parties need to find a way to come together to take the tough decisions to ensure that this scheme survives—but for those for whom it was designed. One event I would like to share with everybody in the chamber is probably one of the most special and extraordinary events I have experienced. We all have these things that just delight, surprise and fill us with joy. In 2021, when the Taliban had returned to Kabul, Australia joined like-minded countries and formed a temporary evacuation airbridge out of the Hamid Karzai airport. I contacted my friend, former Afghan politician Shukria Barakzai, to see if she was okay and if she needed help in leaving. She told me that she was fine—but afterwards found out that she wasn't—but she wanted me to help a young journalist, Khalid Amiri, and his family, who were being hunted by the Taliban and who needed help to get out. I made contact with Khalid on Twitter at the time, and the most extraordinary series of events followed over the next several days, including hundreds of WhatsApp messages between us, as he and his family were navigating the streets of Kabul in burqas to hide their identities. Thanks to Marise and her team, we got them visas. They managed to get to the sewers of Abbey Gate with thousands and thousands of other desperate Afghans, and then there was silence and silence. But then, wonderfully, in question time I received a message from Khalid. He sent me a photo right from the wall at Abbey Gate, and I could see the back of two marines sitting on the wall. I asked him to hand his phone to one of them to see whether the marine would talk to me and whether I could convince that marine that they were Australians, that they had visas and that we wanted them to come to Australia. Wonderfully, this marine, whose name I can't mention but who has been thanked, came on the phone. He knew lots of Aussies from the marine corps, so he recognised the accent. He took Khalid over the wall with his family and dropped them off at the Australian collection point. The rest is now history. Khalid and his family, 16 in total, are now settled in Melbourne, and they are great Australians. They're studying. They're working. Their daughters go to school, have ambitions and have a life in front of them. Khalid has just finished his master's degree at Melbourne University and is now winning awards as a voice for his people, particularly young women. This reminds me that in this place we can't save everybody, but we can save some, and I think that's why we do what we do in this place. As I prepared this speech, I was thinking about who I had to thank—there are many—and I realised that my overwhelming feeling was one of immense gratitude to so many people. Firstly, to the people of Western Australia who elected me to represent them, four times in fact: I hope I have done you proud. To the Liberal Party, my philosophical home for nearly 40 years: I've made so many friends over that time, and so many of them are here tonight. There are far too many of you to thank individually, but you know who you all are and what you mean to me. I also thank my Western Australian colleagues, many of whom are here tonight, and our leader. As Western Australians, we are one mighty team. We are united in our passion for and our commitment to Western Australia. We are so ably led by Michaelia Cash, who is such a wonderful Western Australian. She's a strong leader, and I thank you for your leadership of our team. We've still got a mighty job ahead of us now to win enough seats so that, Peter, you become Prime Minister, and we are in that a hundred per cent. I'd also like to acknowledge Sir Lynton Crosby and Lady Crosby. Lynton gave me my first big job in the Liberal Party. Lynton saw something in me. He gave me so many opportunities and I received such wonderful mentorship over many years. It means a lot to me that you are both here tonight. Thank you for everything that you have done and for your friendship. To my Army mates—who are many—here this evening, it is a very, very special bond we have, and it means a great deal to me that you are here tonight. I'm sure there will be a few wines to celebrate after this, but I am very grateful. Thank you. To my very special friends Heather and Danielle, you couldn't be here tonight, but you have been wonderful, loyal friends and champions, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you do for so many women in the Liberal Party, including me. You are incredibly generous with your time and your money. I'm truly blessed to have had so many amazing friends in and out of this place. Again, many of you are here, and I thank you for that. Unfortunately, Marise couldn't be here tonight, and I want to give a special thanks to Marise—and to Anne and Jane and many others in here. They say that sometimes this building is a very lonely place, and it can be desperately lonely, but when the chips are down and when you can't defend yourself or look after yourself, you have people here who drop everything. They rally around you, they lift you, they support you, and they make sure you're okay, and for that I cannot say thank you enough. You are the reason I am still standing here today. I'm blessed with the most amazing staff, in both my electorate and ministerial offices. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to you all, one I know I will never be able to repay, but I hope that in some way you take great pride in the work you have done and the experiences you have gained. But I am sorry that, for a number of you, your choice of workplace—working for me—was not always a safe one. You, too, have been subject to behaviours that would be unacceptable in any other workplace: a tsunami of hatred directed at me by every possible communication medium. For that, I thank you. Again, there are no suitable words. Thank you to Michelle Lewis, who has been my EA and office manager for what I'm sure she feels are 11 very long years. And it's wonderful to see James Smith, who organised my life as Minister for Defence so beautifully. I thank you for the care you took in ensuring that I was always where I needed to be and always perfectly turned out. Michelle, saying your job has not always been easy is an understatement. I'm more grateful than I can say for your leadership, your friendship and your carriage of our mighty team, and I'm sorry for the burdens that you've also had to carry. To my current team—Ashleigh, Josh, Kyle, Charles and Matt—thank you for the amazing contributions you continue to make. They are incredibly valued, and you are all highly respected for your professionalism, just as are a number of former staff here who have gone on to much bigger and better things in many different careers. So to all my ministerial staff, I say thank you. My extraordinarily talented and committed ministerial teams were so ably led by Fiona Brown, Scott Dewar, Alex Kelton and Darren Disney—and, of course, Dean Carlton, Alex's mighty deputy. Leading ministerial offices is never easy, particularly in cabinet portfolios, where you have ministers with big portfolio ambitions. I'm grateful for all your hard work, and I hope, as I said, you're all rightly proud of your contributions. We don't often, in this place, thank enough the thousands of staff that keep our building, the engine room of democracy, going. There are thousands of staff who keep this place operating, from the wonderful attendants in this chamber to the Black Rod, the Clerk, the cleaners, the gardeners, the drivers, the printers, the caterers, the researchers, the guides and so many more. We don't say it often enough, but thank you. I may also be the first senator ever to thank their lawyers and their doctors. This might be a first! Firstly, to Ashley Tsacalos and his team at Clayton Utz: over the past four years, you have supported me through a defamation case, a criminal trial, a judicial inquiry into the criminal trial, a civil workplace claim, multiple defamation claims and two NACC referrals. Your compassion, your professionalism and your sheer endurance have kept me going through these never-ending proceedings, so thank you. Inadequate as it is, again, thank you. To Martin Bennett and his amazing team—Rachel, Taleesha, Andrew and Cindy—you have supported me now through several separate defamation actions, including the defamation case we are awaiting the verdict for. I'm so grateful that they have been so thorough in piecing together the detail of the plan. There are thousands and thousands of documents now that demonstrate exactly how this plan was developed and executed, and I'm very grateful that you have brought to light the truth, which has given me great peace—and, I know, many others, in terms of finally having their voices heard. Having you in my corner has been life-changing in so many ways. Now, to my doctors. To both Dr Antonio Di Dio and my cardiologist, Professor Abhayaratna—I'm sorry; I always mispronounce it—this patient thanks you for your medical care and the patience you have shown me along this medical journey, often with it playing out in the national media and in the courts. I thank you. As I said at the very beginning, my family means everything to me, in ways that words cannot capture. But I know you know how much I love you and how much I care for you all. I'm also incredibly grateful for the hundreds, if not thousands, of random acts of kindness that my team and I have received from total strangers who send these most wonderful messages. It has made all of the difference, and it reminds us that there is great good out there and that there are good people in the community. My final and most heartfelt thanks go to Robert. I'm so very grateful for the love and unconditional support, particularly over the past four years. It has been unimaginably tough for you. You have had to fight your own battles as well as mine, but you have never taken a step away from my side. For that, I love and thank you. We all leave this place with unfinished business. I certainly do. My colleagues will not be surprised to learn that I have already written to various ministers, shadow ministers and colleagues with some detailed briefing notes on the reforms that are still to be delivered. Rest assured, I will be following you up on orphanage trafficking, antislavery, intercountry adoptions, defence spending, AUKUS implementation and Liberal Party gender reform. I am more determined than ever to finally realise genuine gender reform in the Liberal Party. It is absolutely, well and truly beyond time, but I will have more to say about that. In conclusion, I leave this place with great sadness but also with immense gratitude and great pride. Sorry! I know who I am, and I remain true to my values. I know who I am as a woman and as a leader, and I have confidence in my abilities. I'm a much better and wiser person for the sum of my experiences in this place, and I thank the people of Western Australia and the Liberal Party of Western Australia for the greatest honour of my life. I look forward—I really do, despite the tears—to the next chapter of my service, wherever that will take me. Thank you.

Linda and I have, of course, worked together in this place since 2014, when Linda first arrived, but, like so many of us, Linda and I go back a lot further than that.  Linda, I am often known in this place for ad-libbing my speeches; however, tonight I am actually going to read, because you have such an outstanding record of service, as a senator but also prior to being in this place, that when people look at your valedictory and the contributions in many years to come I want to make sure that that outstanding service to our country is properly recorded. Linda and I actually met as Young Liberals in Western Australia in what is now way back, the 1980s. In fact your partner, Robert Reid, who is with us tonight—hello Robert—was with us back then. In fact, it's almost scary, when I look at it now, to do the maths, because, as much as I still feel like I'm a 17- or 18-year-old, that was actually 35 years ago now, Linda. So, over three decades ago, we were working together in the Young Liberals. I have to say that when I first met you back then—you are slightly older than me, and I used to very much look up to you—even back in the late eighties, when I was still a teenager, I recognised that you had a strong sense of duty and, without a doubt, a desire to serve our nation. Linda joined the Army Reserve in 1984. Linda was just 19 when she decided to embark upon that journey to serve our country, and she found what she has subsequently described on so many occasions: her first great passion in life. What came of that passion can only be described as an extremely impressive and stellar career in the military—I don't think, Linda, too many people know this—for over 30 years. Linda served in various roles—again, as I said, I'm going to read, because they need to be properly recorded—including officer cadet, regional logistics officer, training development officer and military instructor at the Army Command and Staff College, before rising to be commanding officer of the 5th Combat Service Support Battalion, directing the Accountability Model Implementation Project and being director of the Army Strategic Reform Program. People sometimes say to me when they see Linda's name, Senator the Hon. Linda Reynolds, with letters after it, 'Why are there letters after Linda's name?' Well, there's a very good reason for that. In the 2011 Australia Day Honours, Linda was awarded the Conspicuous Service Cross. Linda was awarded that for this reason: For outstanding achievement as the Director of Army Strategic Reform Program coordination. Congratulations, Linda. She was also the adjutant general of the Army Reserve from 2012 to 2013. But I think this is a little-known fact. When we talk in this place about celebrating women, this is something that I don't think too many people actually know. On attaining the rank of brigadier in 2012, Linda became the first woman in the Australian Army Reserve to be promoted to a star rank. I will say that again because I don't think too many people understand (a) what that means and (b) that it is Senator Linda Reynolds. On attaining the rank of brigadier in 2012, Linda became the first woman in the Australian Army Reserve to be promoted to a star rank. That, Linda, cannot ever be taken away from you. This achievement, as we all know, should not be underestimated, and without a doubt it places Linda as a true trailblazer in the Australian Army Reserve. Linda has often commented that her service to the nation was something that she loved more than anything, and, Linda, I say on behalf of each and every one of us that that service of over 30 years, and also being the first woman in the Australian Army Reserve to be promoted to a star rank, as I said, is something that should be acknowledged and is certainly something that should be celebrated. Linda, you have often commented, and others have observed, that your ethos of service to the nation was something that no doubt drove you to seek office in this place. As I said, Linda had been involved in the Young Liberals in our home state of Western Australia, joining the Liberal Party in 1987. Again, a little-known fact about Linda: she was very active in our party in Western Australia over many years, holding many positions not just at a state level but also at a national level, which has also served us well in subsequent elections in Western Australia. Linda was the deputy director of the federal Liberal Party from 2006 to 2008 and manager of the federal Liberal Party campaign committee in 2007. Whilst Linda has served in this place as a senator, she had, prior to that, worked in this place for many years, including as chief of staff to then justice minister Chris Ellison. But, as Linda also acknowledged, her path to get here as an elected senator was not a completely smooth one, and I have to say, unless you were a Western Australian senator at the time, you probably have no idea what that felt like. Linda was elected as a senator, as she said, from third place on the Liberal ticket in the 2013 federal election. But I have to say, again, unless you were a person who was on that ticket at that time, you would have to imagine how you felt when the Western Australian election for the Senate—no other election in Australia at that time, just the Western Australian Senate election—was declared void by the High Court. The High Court was then acting as the Court of Disputed Returns after—as Linda said, it was quite extraordinary—ballot papers were actually lost. Fortunately, they found a lot of them afterwards, in places they should never have been. But what this meant was that they had to re-run the WA election for the Senate, and we had to campaign again as if it was a full campaign. Linda was, again, successful in the re-run election, and her Senate term commenced on 1 July 2014. But there are not many in this place who can say that they sat in this place for the first time having been elected not once but actually twice. An indication of Linda Reynolds's decency was very evident in some of the observations that you made in your first speech, Linda. I went back and I looked at that speech. In thanking the mentors that you had been lucky to have who had encouraged you to pursue the many opportunities, you acknowledged that you had much to pay forward. By any measure, Linda, you have succeeded in paying forward the kindness shown to you by so many of your mentors. In fact, Linda started mentoring many women, in particular, before she even arrived in this place. Linda mentored political leaders from new and troubled democracies, including Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Again, this is a little-known fact about her. Linda remarked in her first speech that she had been inspired and forever changed by their stories and their courage in fighting for what we take for granted in Australia. Linda also acknowledged that she had performed extensive committee service over her 11 years in this place, and, Linda, without a doubt—and it's been acknowledged by many and will be acknowledged—you have always done so with diligence and a dedication to the task at hand. Your first ministerial appointment was as the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs in 2018. You then went on to serve as the Minister for Defence Industry and the Minister for Emergency Management and North Queensland Recovery, but it was in 2019 that you were appointed as Australia's Minister for Defence. It was acknowledged at the time that your many years of military experience were put to good use in that portfolio. Your admiration, respect for and understanding of those who serve in our military were a real strength that you brought to the Defence portfolio. After that, you became the Minister for Government Services and then the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As well as the hard work that you undertook in those portfolios, I think one of the passions that you have always had—and I know that you will continue to have well after you leave this place—was your advocacy against modern slavery and the international child exploitation industry. It has actually been second to none—again, potentially a little-known fact about Linda Reynolds. Linda has spent time overseas investigating and advocating against modern slavery, and indeed, as the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, Linda was responsible for taking the Modern Slavery Act through the parliament. Linda, you have every right to be extremely proud of the work you have done in this area but, more than that, of taking a bill through the parliament that has made a difference. You've also been passionate about the mining and resources industry in Western Australia and of course its contribution to the national economy. You've also been a fierce advocate for technology and innovation in Western Australia, and you understand that our state often leads the nation in technological innovation, particularly in the mining industry. The WA team were united at the time when we fought together for our state's fair share of the GST. And I think something that is well and truly acknowledged in this place is that the WA team hunt together as a pack. We put all our differences aside. WA is always our main focus in this place—and achieving what is best for Western Australia. Certainly, that achievement by the federal Liberal coalition Senate team, working with our House of Reps colleagues, has ensured that WA now does receive its fair share of GST. It was delivered by the former coalition government and it remains a priority for us today. Linda, you can be extremely proud of your more than 10-year service to the Senate and the outstanding contribution you have without a doubt made to our nation. As I said, your service to the nation really did commence back in 1984, when you were but a teenager and you first joined the Army Reserve, and it has never stopped. I want people to read this in the future and understand that, on attaining the rank of brigadier in 2012, you became the first woman in the Australian Army Reserve to be promoted to a star rank. You've outlined in your speech—and I'm not going to canvass it any further here—that working in this place is not always easy, and you outlined the share of challenges that you've faced along the way. But your resilience, your strength of character and your stoicism in the face of these challenges are things that I give you credit for. On behalf of all of us, I want to thank you for not just your service to this place but your service to our country. As I said, you leave this place but you go on to what I hope are bigger and better opportunities. To you and Rob, we wish you only the absolute very best. I know that you will succeed in anything that you do in the future.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","506","Senator RUSTON","243273","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I'll be really quick because I know that you, Linda, would like to get back to drinks with so many of your friends who are here tonight. Standing between you and your friends and a drink at eight-something tonight is probably a really silly thing to do!  Linda, you haven't just been a colleague; you have been a genuine and dear friend, and you will be a genuine and dear friend after you leave this place. Linda is actually hugely good fun, which many of you probably know. She cooks an extraordinarily mean curry, and she can do that really quickly from scratch when she leaves here at eight o'clock, and it can be on the table by quarter to nine. And she's actually obsessed with jigsaws. This is something I found out during COVID, when we didn't have a dining room table, because Linda was always doing a jigsaw puzzle. But the characteristic that defines Linda to me more than any other characteristic is that she is a person of immense integrity, and that is something that I think has been unfairly questioned in this place. The strength that you've shown when your personal life has been smeared across the front page of every paper in this nation over a number of years shows what an extraordinary person you are. I know you are immensely admired by everybody that sits on this side of the chamber. Your time in this place has been marked by many, many achievements. We probably remember the high-ranking one, when you were the Minister for Defence, which was something that I know was so tremendously special to you. As has been mentioned, it was a pretty phenomenal achievement to have risen to the rank of brigadier and been, at the time, the highest-ranking Australian woman in the reserves in Australia's history. I know that that was a role that you took such enormous pride in when you first got it. But I think your tireless work on some of the really tough social issues that you have taken on since you've been here is probably as much an interesting reflection on you as the strength that you demonstrated during your time of service, either in the military or when you got responsibility for our forces when we were in government. You're tough and you're dedicated to service—but she has got a heart that is absolutely enormous and, sadly, to her own detriment, she sometimes wears it on her sleeve instead of keeping it in her chest, which is the reason we love her so much. Much has been said in your contribution and in Michaelia's contribution around the things that you did. Your anti-slavery work in relation to orphanage trafficking was just extraordinary, as was living through it as you were going through it. Something Linda didn't mention is that she is currently the co-rapporteur in relation to orphanage trafficking at the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which is an international body of 180 nations from around the world, and she managed to get a unanimous decision of that group—that is almost unheard of; in fact, it is unheard of—to establish the first global action on orphanage trafficking, which now means every one of those governments around the whole world has a framework through which they can legislate to actually stop orphanage trafficking. It is quite extraordinary, yet I don't think that many people know that that's happened because of Linda Reynolds. I also acknowledge the support that you give to women, which has probably made the treatment that you've received in this place at the hands of some women somewhat more gruelling and galling. I know there are an enormous amount of women in public life and there are an enormous amount of women in this place that are here because of the support and the encouragement of Linda, not just to start but all the way through their journeys. So I think there is a debt of gratitude that is owed to you by so many. Linda, my friend, it's been a pleasure to have had time working in this place with you. We had a false start; we thought we were going to get you here in 2013, but we eventually got you here in 2014. It's been great to be in the chamber with you, but it's also been great to have been your house buddy for most of the time that you've been here. You are incredibly generous and you have got a wicked sense of humour, but your loyalty to your friends and your colleagues is something that absolutely stands out to me. The person who made the statement, 'If in parliament you want a friend, get a dog,' obviously did not know Linda Reynolds. An opposition senator: It was Harry Truman.  Harry Truman didn't know Linda Reynolds—who knew! Go well, my friend, and I hope you now have the opportunity to visit all of those libraries that Rob really wants to take you to!

I wanted to be able to look you straight in the eye. It has been a very long journey since 1987, when Linda Reynolds and Dean Smith joined the Young Liberal movement in Western Australia. For the first two years, I recall frequenting a cafe on Outram Street after Young Liberal movement council meetings, and I know that you're as delighted as I am to have Sandra Mutch and Russell Gianoli in the audience with us tonight, who were there in 1987 as well.  But it wasn't until 1989 when six Young Liberals descended on the car park at the Midland railway station. They had hired a Tarago van. There were three young men and there were three young women. The three young men were all under the age of 21, so they weren't able to drive the hire car across the Nullarbor to Adelaide to attend their first Young Liberal convention. In the car was one Linda Reynolds, myself and four others. We embarked on what was a pretty big adventure at the time, going to our first Young Liberals convention in Adelaide. So excited were we about our newfound importance in the Liberal Party. We got to our Young Liberals convention. Things were very tight. We were not part of the moderates; we were part of the conservatives. We were challenging the moderates, led at the time by Marise Payne and Chris Pyne, who were seeking the very auspicious positions of federal president and vice-president of the Young Liberals. Realising we didn't have the numbers, we thought we would do something bold and brash—and we walked out of the convention! We learnt some very powerful lessons as a result of that experience. Just to finish that tale: we got our first taste of senators interfering in party politics. News had got back to Western Australia that we were supporting the conservative candidate—Karen Raisi, I think, was her name—at the time, and that we weren't supporting Marise Payne and Christopher Pyne. We didn't realise at the time that we were caught in the Howard-Peacock leadership battles. One senator who was very prominent at the time got on a plane, flew to Adelaide, wined and dined us and took us to bars. We had a great night. The next morning they called us to a meeting and said: 'You had a wonderful night the night before. This is my suggested course of action.' We thought: 'That doesn't really make sense to us. We had a wonderful night, thank you very much. We're embarking upon our original course of action'—which didn't go down very well in Western Australia at all. Ever since those days, Linda, you have shown consistency. You have shown tenacity. You have endured through very challenging and difficult times, and you have always triumphed. The Senate and our Senate party room will be the poorer for your absence. On a personal level, I thank you for the courage you have shown me in some of those more difficult battles. You called out the importance of GST reform in your first speech, and it took some years after that to achieve that outcome. We often reflect on the very joyous photos of the marriage debate here in this chamber. Senator Hume and Senator Reynolds—I think there was a sequence in which I mentioned the names in closing the debate. They were very hard and difficult times for many of us in our party. But you, with Jane, were strong and clear, and you joined me in that Senate chamber when many others didn't. I thank you for that courage. It's yet another timely reminder that when the chips are sometimes down for your colleagues, or your friends, you are always there for them. When I caught up with Sandra and Russell last night, that was exactly the comment that Sandra and Russell reflected on—that, no matter the depth of the adversity or struggle you might be going through yourself, with your personal self or your professional self, you've always found time for other people. You were right to identify your achievements: the fifth Liberal woman and the 96th Western Australian senator. You're also one of 10 Western Australian defence ministers. One of those 10 was Paul Hasluck, who later became Governor-General. One of those 10 was John Forrest, who had been Premier. One of those 10 was Sir George Pearce, who served 12 years plus as the Minister for Defence of this country. One was John Curtin, and one was Kim Beazley. You join those ranks as the only female Western Australian to have been a Commonwealth defence minister. And you are one of 60 Western Australian parliamentarians to have served in the federal ministry. These are great achievements by any measure, but I think it is the values, the care and the courage that you have brought to your role that are the stand-out virtues. As a friend, I wish you all the very best for whatever happens next. In your first speech to the Senate, you mentioned how you were well accustomed to change. It's a bit difficult sitting here, having this conversation and extending these remarks, knowing that Linda Reynolds will always be somewhere, and my great hope—having, with myself and others, pursued some important battles of reform in our own party—that you will be a constant presence in the Western Australian Liberal Party going forward, demonstrating to young Liberals of the now and of the future that you can have values, you can have courage and you can make friends and that these things can endure through a parliamentary career. Thank you very, very much, from me to you, for your support of me and the causes that we've fought for together. I wish you, Robert and your whole family the very best of happiness and good fortune, whatever happens next. I'm sure we'll be walking that path in other places in years to come as well. Best wishes.

She first came to my attention back in 2015, I think it might have been, or even 2014, just after she had finally been elected. She came to Melbourne and did a speech for the Liberal Party in Melbourne—I think for the women's section, actually—and I was tossing up at that stage whether I was going to run for the Senate myself. And there's this extraordinary woman who's up the front of the stage. She was a brigadier, the first woman to have achieved that level in the military. She'd been a champion of women in the military. She'd been an adviser to a minister, and now she was a senator. She'd worked at the federal secretariat. I thought: 'Oh my god! I'm so unqualified for this job. Here is this extraordinary woman. Look at all that she's achieved.'  Who would have thought that, however many years later, I would be dancing with you and Robert to ABBA holograms on the other side of the world. That's something I will never forget, my friend. It was quite extraordinary. I never thought that I'd become your housemate. I know that you will agree with me that those years that we lived together—and we went through some pretty exceptional times—were also the happiest times, I think, I've spent in this place. The things that you have achieved have been quite extraordinary. I met Khalid. This young Afghan man bounded up to me at an event in Melbourne and said: 'You're a senator. Oh my goodness, do you know Linda Reynolds?' I went: 'Yes. I absolutely do.' And there's this smile on his face as he told me the story that I'd already heard, because I'd lived through it as your housemate. It was such a joy to see this young man and the new life that he had started here in Australia, in my hometown, because of you. I've also met the young women that you have mentored, nurtured and sponsored through the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party. I can't think of a woman that they more admire in the party than Linda Reynolds. You have shown them such guidance, and for that you should be extraordinarily proud. I hope you will continue on that mission, not just in Western Australia but right around the country. Can I just say—and I did promise I would be brief—that because we lived with you through this moment you were sucked into a world of pain, and it was a life-changing event. It was not of your making, it was not of your doing, and it could have been any one of us in here. But your kindness, your loyalty and your decency were used against you for political purposes, for electoral gain and, disgustingly, for financial gain. For that, there are many people that can never be forgiven. Anybody who is listening along at home or watching this on the television may not be able to see the enormous number of people that have come here tonight because they love and admire you. I admire so much that you speak of this place when it is at its best because you were the victim of it when it was at its worst. Thank you very much for your friendship, on behalf of your friends, your family and your colleagues. You have made us so very proud. You've served your state; you've served your party. You've served your country with distinction, and I know that you will go on to do that. I look forward to being friends with you for a very long time outside of this place—and Robert; I look forward to dancing 'Waterloo' with you again another time soon. But, in the meantime, I know you have a milestone birthday coming up, Linda. Sorry! Am I allowed to say that out loud? Is that really rude? I look forward to seeing the next chapter of how Linda Reynolds serves her country, because it will be spectacular.

She has been a friend to all of us. I think it was Senator Cash who said Linda lives by the 'pay it forward' ethos. You do so in spades.  I am relatively new to this place, having been elected in 2019, and I consider myself one of the lucky ones, because I am a beneficiary of the women, like Linda, who have come before me. I came into this place and I had a defence minister who was a female and who had been the first female brigadier in the Army Reserve. As a former Army reservist myself, I knew of you already. So she was already on a pedestal when I walked into this place. But, Linda, we had Marise Payne, Senator Cash and my colleague Senator Bridget McKenzie, who, as a group, wrapped their arms around all of the new women who walked into this place and said: 'Your experience will not be like ours. Your experience is going to be better, and we will make this place better for women.' And you have done that. All of your colleagues at the cabinet table at that time did that, and so I am forever grateful to have had the privilege of coming in when I did, when there was that generosity of spirit, that real support of women supporting women, and I knew that people like you had my back. That's why I will just say that it was with absolute horror that I saw what you went through. I knew that there was no way that the Linda Reynolds I knew could have been guilty of what she was being accused of. But I don't want to dwell on that, because I want to dwell on all your other achievements. You've spoken on the modern slavery legacy that you leave, and it is true. It will continue to lead to genuine change right across the globe, because I know you're not leaving it alone; you are going to continue to work in that space, and that is fantastic. I've already mentioned the support you've given to women, the work on gender reform that you are truly committed to. It has made a difference. It has made a difference in the Army Reserve and it has made a difference in this place. You will continue to make a difference in that area. I also want to personally thank you for joining me on the Senate Select Committee on Australia's Disaster Resilience, for showing me around and sharing your vast wealth of experience and knowledge from your personal experience as an emergency management minister and a defence minister, and your thorough understanding of the issues we were trying to investigate. Your pragmatic approach was: what is the problem we are trying to fix, and what is a genuine solution that we can present so that the report we produce doesn't end up, like so many reports that are produced in this place, on a shelf collecting dust? You have a proven track record of participating in committees and producing reports that make a difference. I believe that that report will also make a difference. Linda, when I think of you I think of a calm, reasonable, approachable, pragmatic woman who truly lives her values. You are a role model to me. May you continue to be a role model to your colleagues in the Western Australian Liberal Party. I sincerely thank you, but I also want to thank you on behalf of my colleagues in the Nationals. Your door has always been open to us. You've always shared your knowledge. I wish you and Rob all the best in your future, because the next chapter is going to be fantastic.

Linda, you'll recall that you were the campaign chair when I ran for the seat of Burt, and I learnt a tremendous amount from you in that campaign. But, prior to that, you'll recall, Linda, I didn't win that preselection initially, and I remember getting the phone call from you straight after it. You were, I think, one of the first people that I heard from, and you encouraged me to turn up to the next thing and stick with it. You saw something in me. At the time, I was disappointed, and you were there for me. That preselection was turned over, and I ended up being selected to run for the seat of Burt. I didn't win at the election, but I learnt so much from you through that campaign and have been able to pay what I learnt from you forward to many campaigns that I've been able to be involved in since. I'm very grateful for that.  Everyone tonight has spoken of the courage and the incredible tenacity that you have shown over these past few years, and it's something that we're all grateful for having seen. We wish it wasn't the case that you had to go through that, but we have admired you tremendously over these last few years. I'm thinking about, now, the effort that you're putting into campaigns even now. You could be forgiven, having had a very successful career here, for wanting to, maybe, put your feet up, but you are an absolute champion. The way that you are getting behind all of our candidates across Western Australia in this election campaign is phenomenal, and everyone respects you tremendously for that. The way that you are getting behind all of us is just wonderful. Linda, I wish you the very best in what comes next. As others have remarked, I really do hope that you see yourself as playing and will play a key role within the party going forward. You talk about the reform I think you will continue, and I hope you will continue, to play a really pivotal role for our party, particularly in Western Australia. I also hope that you—and I've got no doubt that you will—play a significant role in service to our nation. I've got no doubt that you'll play a role, possibly even internationally, of service to our nation and, indeed, the world, particularly in the area of modern slavery. I've got this sneaking suspicion that what you've been able to establish here with the Modern Slavery Act won't be the end of the contribution that you've made in that space on this important issue that I got to witness firsthand. I don't know if you recall that I was working at Minderoo at the time that you were developing that; there was some support and assistance provided by the Minderoo Foundation at that time. Your dedication to that, I've got no doubt, will continue. Linda, thank you. Congratulations on a very successful career, and I look forward to seeing what comes next.

One of your many achievements that hasn't been mentioned tonight, though, Linda, is the incredible work that you did reinstating the howitzer Defence project for the people of Geelong after it was callously cancelled by the former Labor government. I remember that day so well: standing in Waurn Ponds, making that announcement committing to bring back Defence vehicle manufacturing to Geelong with the howitzer Defence project. That was, of course, just prior to the 2019 election, when I was the member for Corangamite. Now at Avalon we have the most amazing Hanwha Armoured Vehicle Centre of Excellence. It is incredible, delivering not only the howitzer Defence project but also phase 3 of Land 400. That's just one of your many legacies where you understood the importance of defence industry, backing the men and women of the ADF and making sure that they have the capability they need to keep them safe whenever they are called to serve our country on the battlefield. It was a disgrace that that project was cancelled by the former Labor government, and it is a great credit to you, Linda, that, drawing on your expertise and your incredible service to our nation, you reinstated that project. Thank you for the incredible work that you've done on modern slavery, for people with disability and for women. There is a very, very long list which I won't repeat. But the thing that really stands out to me, Linda, is that, no matter what you do, you do it with such courage. I have been your great friend over the last four or so years as you have taken on the injustice to which you were subjected so disgracefully, including by members of the Labor Party and by the government as a whole. I am so proud of the way you have fought. Your treatment was utterly disgraceful. It was debilitating, and I am so proud of the fact that you are still fighting for justice. You have so much more to give. To you and to Rob, as a great team, I say that I know you will leave this place with many great plans. I absolutely cannot wait to see what you do next, but I know that, whatever it is, you will continue to serve to 100 per cent of your capability. You will be driven by the strongest sense of justice, care and kindness for others, and I wish you all the very best for the years ahead.

I don't want to get between our friends and a drink, but it is very important to me to say a few words. I'm not going to repeat your career, Linda. We've heard that. We understand what a stellar ornament to this place and to the WA Liberal Party you have been.  In many ways, my career has followed behind Linda's. Linda and I were rivals in our first preselection battle, in 2012. We both put our hands up. Linda won fair and square. I don't know if she slightly regretted winning it when 2013 happened and I was No. 4 on the ticket. I talked to the then state director, Ben Morton, and I said: 'Ben, you know, we're not going to win four. Do you really need me on there still? It should just be the top three.' But Ben said, 'Oh, I'll think about it,' but then said, 'No, you're going to stay on there.' So we did go through the campaign, where one and two were solid and four was never going to get up, but it was fighting to make sure we retained our third spot in the Senate. It was such an important fight to have. It was a unique election campaign. Literally no-one can say they've been through a campaign like that, except for four people, basically, and I don't think anyone is likely to have to go through it again. I certainly don't envy them if they do. You've served the Western Australian Liberal Party with such distinction for a long period of time. As I've been able to say in Western Australia on a few occasions when we've been at events together over the last few months, you have gone out at a moment of your choosing; I know it's perhaps not the way you would have liked your career to end, but I admire you for that. I admire you for everything you've done for the Liberal Party of Western Australia and for this place—and for the achievements you've had, which have been talked about by my colleagues. To Rob, to your family, to Michelle and all your staff: it is such a wonderful career that you have had, and you have given so much of yourself to this place, to our nation and to the Western Australian Liberal Party.

Many of us have the wonderful opportunity to serve in this place, but few of us get the opportunity to say that we've had such an impact on the lives of so many not just in our country but around the world.  To a first-term senator such as me, you've demonstrated what a conviction politician is—someone who leads with truth and integrity in the face of disgraceful political bullying. I've learned very quickly in this job that you have to pick your battles. On what you've been subjected to by those opposite: many might have run away from that, but you stood your ground because you knew it was the right thing to do. It was the right thing not just to defend yourself—when those of us here know the true character of who you really are—but to stand up to defend those who were also impacted through that and to set a precedent. If you don't stand up for what is right, you allow for a standard to be lowered, and those consequences will be felt by all of us in here and those who come to this place for generations to come. It is evident in everything you have done that you have set a standard, a standard for all right around the country—one that we must continue to push to maintain and continue to push higher in this place. That should be part of the legacy you leave behind here. That's a promise I can make to you. As conservative women in particular, we don't have the luxury of the feminist sisterhood coming to our side in times such as those you've had to endure. Therefore, for me personally, I want to recognise your incredible courage and your commitment. You absolutely should be recognised and commended for that—and so too your family, because we all know that, in this place, we can't do it without our family. And Colin just wanted me to mention this to Robert: thank you, Robert, for demonstrating what a partner, a husband, looks like who stands by such a wonderful woman doing a courageous job for Australians and what family means, because you are just such an important piece of that puzzle. Thank you, Robert. I just want to say that part of me wishes I weren't losing you after my first term, but I'm also very aware that you've got plenty planned for your future. I know that you have so much more to give as well, and I know that you will continue to give. Thank you for demonstrating to me the kind of woman that I hope to grow up to be.

I think tonight we've seen the quality of the person of Linda, of what you have brought to this place, of what you've done over the years. Throughout it, through your experience, you've demonstrated the absolute professionalism that you've had all the time and that you show in all aspects of your life. I've had the pleasure of knowing you, I think, for nearly 20 years. Wow, it has gone so fast. Throughout that time, I've always been inspired by you, your ability and your commitment to everything that you've done and your encouragement of the Liberal women. You've done that throughout the time that I've known you. I'm one of those beneficiaries. I can remember having a conversation in New Acton here probably 10 years ago. As a result of that, I'm here today. I'm actually very thankful for the fact that you did that and also that I was fortunate enough to have you escort me into the Senate chamber when I was sworn in.  On the committee work that you've done, you mentioned tonight tick-borne diseases. That's something you mentioned to me very early in my career, and I was very pleased that we finally were able to get that up. I was really pleased when we came to an agreement—with a heated discussion earlier in the week!—around finalising the report. Thank you very much for that. You're never afraid of hard work. You're so committed to everything you do. You give it 150 per cent, and I'm just so proud of you. You will be missed. Everyone in the chamber will miss you, especially on our side.

I just want to associate myself with my colleagues' comments tonight—those from Michaelia and from all across the chamber. How we conduct the traditions of this institution is important, and it reflects on us. The way that your valedictory tonight has been conducted, attended and observed is a reflection on our respect for the chamber. The way that it hasn't been attended and respected is a reflection on those on the other side of the chamber, and it's to their shame and it's a stain on this place.  The way that you were treated—I was sitting next to you during all of that period in the last parliament. I worked with you night and day through COVID and all of those events to ensure that Australians were able to get through the pandemic safely. You were looking after disadvantaged Australians on the NDIS at that time. I was dealing with aged care. But to see the heartless and callous way that you were attacked in this place for political gain is a stain on this place. It really is. You said in your speech that they found your breaking point. I think the way that you continue to conduct yourself shows that they didn't break you. You're an incredibly strong woman, person, colleague and friend who we all value enormously, and you deserved better, and the fact that you have been progressively vindicated is a demonstration of that to us all. There are things that occurred here in the chamber but also within the legal system that are an absolute disgrace, in my view, and it's an absolute tribute to you that you continue to fight. The achievements that you've made during your time have been so eloquently described by our colleagues here tonight, as has the respect that we have for you as a colleague. I first met you when you were involved with the secretariat and we were campaigning to get campaigns done and colleagues elected and all of those sorts of things. I can only reflect on that experience and everything that you put into everything that you did for the benefit of the campaigns that you were working on and in the portfolios for the benefit of the country. To have seen you achieve all of the things that you did is a thing of great pride for us all, because when our colleagues are succeeding it is a success for us too. We all carry that together. What we achieved during the last parliament in getting this country through the pandemic was extraordinary. When you look at it in the context of other countries around the world, we were at the pinnacle of that, and for you and former prime minister Morrison to continue to be derided even now is a shame, because it's not deserved. So I am so delighted to see so many colleagues on their feet tonight paying tribute to you as a part of this process, which is an important part of the traditions of the parliament. As I said before, the way that we observe them is a demonstration of our respect or otherwise for this place that we all have the privilege to serve in, and it is the ultimate privilege in this country to serve in the parliament—and, I say, particularly in the Senate. So, Linda, congratulations. Rob, thank you. It was bloody hard at times, but you, Rob, can be enormously proud—as you can, Linda—of Linda's amazing achievements in this place. We know that there is so much more to come, and we wish you all the very best for those.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","537","Senator McKIM","JKM","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","At the commencement of my contribution on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025, I foreshadow the moving of the second reading amendment that has been circulated in Senator Hanson-Young's name. This is a sad, sad day for environment protection in Australia. I want to be very clear about how we find ourselves here today. We find ourselves here today because the old political parties in this country, the Labor and Liberal parties, have colluded to do a number of things. They've colluded to, firstly, get industrial salmon farming into Macquarie Harbour, on Tasmania's West Coast, where it never should have been permitted to move in in the first place. Remember, a third of Macquarie Harbour is World Heritage area. It is the last remaining home of the maugean skate anywhere on the planet—an iconic ancient fish species that is one adverse event away from extinction.  The Labor and Liberal parties have also colluded to allow the toxic industrial salmon farming industry in Tasmania to be effectively unregulated, even though there are some very high-level so-called regulations in place. This is an industry that, like so many others in Tasmanian, historically and currently, has got the ear of both the Labor and Liberal parties. As a result, it is not subject to the stringent regulations that it should be subject to. We've seen this in Tasmania, where industries or organisations get hold of major party governments. We saw it with hydro back in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, when they built dam after dam. They basically ran the state for decades. Then they suffered a big defeat at the hands of an emerging conservation movement, an emerging Greens party, in Tasmania when the Franklin dam was stopped. Then along came the forest industry, which, again, completely captured the Labor and Liberal parties in Tasmania—by the way, where I found my environmental awakening, when I was arrested at a place called Farmhouse Creek in the mid-1980s. For decades, the forest industry ran Tasmania. Then we had companies like Gunns, who were a forestry company but proposed a pulp mill for the Tamar Valley. Sorry, I've fast-forwarded past the Wesley Vale pulp mill debacle, which I'll go back to and which I'm very grateful for in one way because it gave us Christine Milne, who was the first woman to lead a political party in Tasmania's history and later, of course, went on to lead the Australian Greens as a senator in this place. We had the Tamar Valley pulp mill, and then the tourism industry came along and got hold of the government down there in Tasmania. The Labor and Liberal parties just gave the tourism industry everything they wanted: 'You want to develop inside national parks? Yes, you go for it. We'll even establish an expressions-of-interest process to allow you to do that.' Today, it is the industrial salmon farming corporations who have got their hooks into both the Labor and Liberal parties—the Liberal and Labor parties in Tasmania and both the Liberal and Labor parties up here in Canberra. Of course, it's a Liberal government down in Tasmania and a Labor government up here. How else did we get to this place? I want to rewind a little bit and talk about the commitment Labor made before the last election. Labor promised the Australian people before the last election that Labor would fix the broken environment laws that were not doing their job of protecting the environment. That was a solemn commitment that the Labor Party gave to the Australian people. The Labor Party was very close to an agreement with the Greens only months ago to deliver on that commitment and pass legislation through this place that would actually have improved environmental protections in Australia. It didn't go as far as we would have liked it to go, not even close, but it would have indisputably represented an improvement in environmental protections in Australia. What happened then? The fossil fuel CEOs got on the phone to Mr Albanese and got on the phone to the Western Australian Premier, Mr Cook, and those two people were instructed to pull the agreement and pull the legislation. Labor then struck their own bill off the Notice Paper in this place. So there went any hope of improving environmental protection laws in Australia because the fossil fuel corporations gave their marching orders to the Australian Labor Party. When the fossil fuel corporations say, 'Jump,' the Australian Labor Party ask, 'How high would you like us to jump?' Now we come to today. When it's not the fossil fuel companies who are pulling the strings of a puppet Labor government, it is the industrial salmon farming corporations who are pulling the strings of this compliant Labor government. By the way, the industrial salmon farming corporations operating in Tasmania have paid no corporate tax at all in the last five years. They are in the middle of a mass mortality event where at least a million—honestly, probably two or three million by now—fish have died. They've been sprung suffocating live fish by throwing them into pens with dead fish and then closing those pens down so that the live fish suffocate. It's egregious animal cruelty to the extent that the RSPCA has now permanently withdrawn its accreditation from the company involved. It is a mass mortality event that has led to countless beaches in south-east Tasmania being contaminated with dead salmon carcasses. A congealed, fatty, stinking mess is washing up on the beaches in south-eastern Tasmania. There are plenty of beaches in south-eastern Tasmania where you can't go swimming without bumping into stinking, rotten salmon carcasses. You can't go walking on the beaches without your feet being coated in stinking, fatty slime composed of the remnants of dead salmon. You can't take your dogs down to those beaches, because the dogs eat the diseased, antibiotic riddled remnants of the dead salmon. On top of all that, you've got these industrial salmon farming corporations—they are multinational corporations offshoring their profits, I might add, while they're paying no corporate tax here in Australia—driving an ancient, iconic fish species, the maugean skate, into extinction. That's how we've ended up here today—regulatory capture; state capture; political parties bought off by dirty political donations; the Labor and Liberal parties refusing to stand up to corporate vested interests, as usual in Tasmania and up here in Canberra; and toxic salmon farming companies that only care about their profits, which they offshore. But do you know what they're not offshoring? They're not offshoring their animal cruelty, they're not offshoring the extinction of the maugean skate, they're not offshoring the polluting mess that they are leaving behind on our beaches, they're not offshoring the slime and the sludge that coats the dead zones underneath salmon farming cages and they're not offshoring the massive harm they are doing to Tasmania's vibrant marine ecological systems. They're not offshoring any of that; they're just offshoring the profits. They're leaving all the misery, the animal agony, the species' extinction and the environmental harm behind. That's got to be dealt with by the Tasmanian people, it's got to be dealt with by our marine environment and it's got to be dealt with by an iconic fish species that had been doing quite nicely—thank you very much—for countless millennia in Macquarie Harbour until the toxic industrial salmon farms moved in where they never should have gone in the first place. I want to remind people of this: times are changing. There's a mood down in Tasmania—and I believe it's not limited to Tasmania—where people have had a gutful of what is going on. People have had a gutful of the marine pollution caused by toxic industrial salmon farms. They've had a gutful of the species extinction caused by toxic industrial salmon corporations. They've had a gutful of walking along their local beaches and having their feet coated in the remnants of dead salmon. They've had a gutful of going for a dip, a swim, and bumping into diseased, rotten salmon carcasses. The people have had a gutful and they are rising up against this; they are rising up in their droves right now. They are not only coming to rallies. They are not only coming into this parliament, as we've seen this week. They are also going to vote in massive numbers at the ballot box in this federal election. They're going to vote for the environment and for the maugean skate. They're going to vote for candidates and political parties like the Greens and independent candidates who are standing up against salmon farming corporations. They are going to vote for those parties, and they are going to put the Labor and Liberal parties last because of what they have done. I want to say that I'm proud to be part of a political party that has been part of that movement. I want to acknowledge the work of one person in particular in the Greens, and that is my friend Senator Pete Whish-Wilson, who is in the chamber here. On our behalf, and on behalf of countless Tasmanians, he has led the charge on this issue for well over a decade. He is a warrior for our oceans who has led the charge and worked tirelessly alongside local communities and the environment movement in Tasmania to bring to light the corruption, the species extinction that is looming and the way in which this corrupt toxic industry has got its hooks into the major political parties. When I saw Senator Whish-Wilson sharing his opinions with the Prime Minister this morning, I wanted to say I am very, very proud to be a member of the same political party, and I'm very glad that the Prime Minister can be so certain about the views that are so passionately held by the Australian Greens in this place. Australia's environment laws, by the end of tonight, are going to be weaker and less protective of the environment than when Labor came to power three years ago. Labor came to power promising to improve environmental protections in Australia. They're going to go to an election, after a full term in government, having delivered a massive weakening of environment protections in this country. It is a shameful abrogation of their responsibility to nature, it is a shameful breach of an election promise they made to the Australian people before the last election and it is an embarrassing shattering of the mandate that they were given by the Australian people to improve environment laws. The vote share of the major parties in this country is collapsing at speed. Thirty-five years ago nearly 95 per cent of Australian voters voted for either the Labor Party or the coalition. At the last election that was down to nearly 65 per cent and it's going to crash again at this election, largely because neither the Labor Party nor the coalition are prepared to step up to defend and protect nature. They're in lockstep on destroying our forests. They are in lockstep in backing the big toxic salmon farming corporations who are destroying our marine environment, destroying coastal amenity and driving the maugean skate into extinction. Well, the Greens have had a gutful, and ever-increasing numbers of Australians have had a gutful. I'll make a prediction here: the environment vote at this election will be the biggest we have ever seen in Australia's history. People in their droves are going to vote for nature, they're going to vote for the marine environment, they're going to vote for our forests and they're going to vote out the old parties who refuse to stand up and defend nature.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","538","Senator McALLISTER","121628","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I thank senators for their contribution to the debate. Labor is committed to fixing our environment laws so that they work better for our environment and better for business. That means that our laws need to improve nature and protect our unique native plants and animals, but our laws also need to be less bureaucratic. Our laws need to provide more certainty for business and more certainty for the communities that benefit from business activity. That is what the community expects, and that is what we're delivering as a government. We do this in commonsense ways that support communities and protect the environment.  Everybody agrees that the current laws don't work. We came to government saying that we would fix them and that we would improve certainty for business—the kind of certainty that helps drive investment in jobs, communities and nation-building projects—and that is what we are doing. We also said that we wanted a country in which nature is being repaired and is regenerating rather than continuing to decline, and that is what we are doing. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025 would address a critical problem in our current laws. It's a problem that puts jobs, investment and individual livelihoods at risk. This bill would support the government's commitment to provide certainty, clarity and fairness for ongoing industries, workers and communities affected by the reconsideration of certain decisions under the EPBC Act. The bill would remove the ability of the minister for the environment to reconsider a past decision on an action that meets certain criteria. Reconsideration powers have been available to the minister since the beginning of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act a quarter of a century ago. These powers exist to enable the minister to respond to a limited range of circumstances based on new and changing environmental information, and this is important. But these powers can create considerable uncertainty and affect communities that have come to depend on a lifeline industry. The economic and social impacts of changing a decision can be significant, putting jobs, community and individual livelihoods at risk. The bill recognises that established and lawfully operating projects where proponents did the right thing and referred their action to the environment minister and where those proponents have been investing and operating for five or more years on the basis of that decision should not be put at risk. This bill would only capture a small subset of decisions that can be reconsidered. The technical language is that these are 'not a controlled action—particular manner' decisions, or NCA-PM decisions; these decisions are made when the minister decides that an action does not require approval because the action would be undertaken in the particular manner described. The bill would also recognise the important role that states and territories play in managing environmental impacts through their own plans, policies and laws. The amendment specifies that a project must have a state or territory management arrangement specified in its particular manner to meet the criteria. In the context of this debate, many in this chamber have raised Macquarie Harbour, and it is certainly the case that discussion about Macquarie Harbour has illuminated the challenges that are present in the existing act. The industries, communities and environments like those in Macquarie Harbour present a really useful example. Given the discussion that has taken place about Macquarie Harbour, I want to make the following factual points about the approach the government is taking to the conservation issues that are doubtless present in Macquarie Harbour, particularly in relation to the maugean skate. We have invested $37½ million in priority conservation actions for the maugean skate population in Macquarie Harbour. These are investments to improve water quality and environmental conditions within Macquarie Harbour and to support critical species conservation actions, including a successful captive breeding program. We're also actively working with salmon industry stakeholders on further steps that can be taken to protect the environment and ensure the industry has a sustainable and long-term future producing salmon. The Australian government is committed to working in partnership with industry, communities and states and territories to protect our environment and support the conservation and recovery of our threatened species. We've invested more than $500 million in targeted threatened species recovery, including under the Saving Native Species Program, the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Environmental Science Program. This is complemented by other government investments for Ramsar wetlands, World Heritage properties and protected areas that support biodiversity conservation and the recovery of threatened species. This bill strikes a balance between the important task of protecting our environment and the need to provide certainty and stability to businesses which have already made a substantial investment to get a project up and running and, most importantly, a project which supports jobs. This is sensible and balanced regulation. The proposed changes would commence the day after royal assent and would apply to any reconsideration decision made under section 78 after the amendment commences, regardless of how long ago the original decision was made. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","552","Senator DUNIAM","263418","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I move the opposition's amendment on sheet 3338:   Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 24), after item 1, insert: 1A After paragraph 78A (2) (b) Insert:  be made within the 12-month period starting on the day the decision was made; and 1B Subsection 78C (1) Omit 'As soon as practicable', substitute 'Within 12 months'. This amendment is related to the timeframes for the period of time a request for reconsideration can be made and the period of time relating to the assessment of the request put before the minister. Our amendment is to shorten those periods of time, at least in the case of the period of time a request for reconsideration can be made, from five years to 12 months—a one-year window in which a request can be made. We feel that, of course, with the amount of information that is available in the public domain, for members of the community to be able to assess that, that is an adequate period of time. Similarly, we don't think that within the act, as it stands today, 'as soon as practicable' is an adequate and tight enough definition about how long the minister can take to make a decision, hence the insertion of 'within 12 months' to substitute the 'as soon as practicable' terminology in the legislation. Timeliness is a big problem with the EPBC Act. It has been for a very long time now. Nearly every sitting week in this place, during this term of parliament, there have been issues raised with regard to projects that are currently before the minister or being assessed in the department where timeliness is an issue. It can be about the time taken to provide information, the time taken to assess information and the time taken by a minister to make a decision about a reconsideration request. For heaven's sake, we have been on this issue now since the tail end of 2023. A reconsideration request was lodged nearly 18 months ago, and we still don't have a decision. I don't know where the minister was going to go on the question that was before her, and we never will know, because the laws we're passing today, the workaround legislation to get around a minister who chose not to do her job but was forced by the Prime Minister to introduce legislation to work around her intransigence. We don't know what the end result of this minister's work would have been. We don't know whether the claims by the Bob Brown Foundation, the taxpayer funded Environmental Defenders Office or the Australia Institute were legitimate. We'll never know whether the department's advice to the minister validated those claims or not. Here we are, 18 months on, and, if anyone thinks that 18 months is a good enough period of time and it's acceptable, then I would love to hear the reasons for that. I don't think it's acceptable, which is why we are moving these amendments to build in some timelines and some timeliness. Certainty is something that has been talked about ad nauseam in this debate. Certainty is something that proponents of projects and, of course, the community are seeking with regard to reforms to environmental approval laws in this country. The minister said, back in December 2022, in response to the State of the environment report where we had this massive promise to reform the EPBC Act, that these laws would be better for business and better for the environment. In fact, I think we heard that catchcry again just now from the government—that the reforms that this government intends to bring in sometime in the future will be better for the environment and better for business. I'm afraid I've seen nothing that would address the concerns around timeliness or that would deal with the fact that you go into this black box for decisions and assessments to be made. There are stop-the-clock provisions as well; there's a whole raft of issues relating to timeliness and the complexity of process. So we don't think that it is unreasonable to seek to put timeframes around the window of time in which any community group or any other individual in the community can lodge a request for reconsideration, nor do we think it's wrong to curtail the time taken to make a decision—18 months is too long. The open-ended nature of what we have in the act today, before the bill we're debating now becomes law, is ridiculous. And the fact that, at any point in the future, anywhere in the country, someone can make a request for reconsideration, upending permits that have been in place, in the case of the Tasmanian salmon industry, for 13 years now—I find it astounding that there is no stepped process through this, where there are checks and measures before the minister is forced to initiate a reconsideration, one that has created such immense uncertainty. There have been claims made that there are just 22 salmon workers in Strahan. I can tell you now, there are more than 22. I challenge my Tasmanian Greens Senate colleagues to come with me to Strahan and meet the more than 22 workers and tell them why you think their jobs don't exist. Tell them why you think their jobs aren't important or why it doesn't matter that a decision is never made. Come and see them and tell them they're imaginary. The point being that the open-ended nature of the current situation, which the government is going some way to try to fix with their five-year window, as I said, I don't think is good enough. But, if the Greens were to have their way—and I suspect and fear that, perhaps, after an election if the pollsters are to be believed, the crowd down the end there, the Australian Greens, may well be in partnership with the Australian Labor Party, and anything we do this side of an election may well be moot—they may seek to reverse the changes that are being made today and revisit— ","Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsiderations) Bill 2025","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DUNIAM (Tasmania—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) ","(21:46):","N/A"

How is it vexatious to tell the people of Strahan that they don't have jobs, their jobs are real, their jobs aren't important and their community isn't important? That's the mantra that's coming from these people down the end of the chamber, who have no regard that this government has got away with this for 18 months and stood idly by right until the death knock of this government, allowing extremists in our community to mount these campaigns and cause misery for households and communities on the West Coast and to denigrate the jobs that these people have. The fact that you're happy with some open-ended piece of legislation that enables this sort of activity to happen, bringing misery unto these households and families and creating the uncertainty that it did, is outrageous.  I do believe that there is a strong case for us to be able to limit these timeframes. You only have to look at other jurisdictions that do have more certainty in their decision-making processes. This is good for the community as well because you know what the situation is. You know that there is certainty around decisions being made by government. Unfortunately, I can tell you, the people of Strahan, a community that is interested in the environment, don't want the environment trashed, but they do support this industry. It is not an all-or-nothing proposition like the Greens would have you believe. The two can co-exist. Industry trades on brand, would you believe? They actually want a good brand, but the Australian Greens, of course, have made an art form out of going around the world and telling the rest of the world that we do things terribly here. In actual fact, if you look at other countries—for example, Chile—where they farm salmon, they don't care about the environment. They don't care about human rights. They don't care about workers' rights. The Greens would rather see imports of salmon coming into this country than stand up for the jobs of salmon workers in this country, because, again, they don't matter. 'There are only 22 salmon workers; the rest are imaginary.' I think it is, frankly, offensive. Again, I'd be happy to drive to Strahan with you, Senator Whish-Wilson, to go and visit these workers, and we can explain what we each stand for on the bill we have before us and why it's important to give certainty. They're a community that deserve our explanations about what we're doing here. As I said, it's not all or nothing, but the one thing we should be deriving out of this bill today is a modicum of certainty, both for the community of Strahan and for other communities like it across the country that have fallen foul of inner-city Greens who want to tear down industries like the salmon industry. That's all we're asking for here, and I commend the amendments to the Senate.

While these amendments do not include a requirement for the minister to make a decision within a certain timeframe, the fact is that they do provide certainty for business and for environmental outcomes. They seek to strike a balance between the interests of industries, communities and the environment. The changes recognise that reconsideration remains an important tool for environmental management, and the changes do not seek to arbitrarily curtail it. The amendments are really targeted at established industries that have been operating on the basis of an NCA-PM decision in accordance with a state or territory management arrangement for five or more years. They achieve a common-sense solution, balancing environmental outcomes while addressing the economic uncertainty faced by industries and the communities that depend on them.  The amendment moved by Senator Duniam seeks to expand the number, or the nature, of exemptions, and we don't support that. It does so by restricting the timeframe from five years down to 12 months. Five years was chosen as the threshold because we are looking at actions that have been ongoing and recurring over five years or more before the request for consideration. That would provide time for the impacts associated with the relevant action, as they were known at the time of the NCA-PM decision, to stabilise and become consistent. Having reached this point, the criterion would provide an appropriate balance between protecting the environment and providing certainty and fairness to businesses, workers and their communities. The amendment also requires the minister to make a decision within 12 months rather than as soon as practicable. This is an arbitrary imposition of a particular timeframe. 'As soon as practicable' is a well-understood legal concept and does the task that is required in terms of the amendments that have been proposed to the head legislation by the government in this case. I do want to use the time I have remaining to make a few comments about the approach that's been taken to this debate. When we seek to have challenging conversations within our communities about issues that people have very strong views on, people bringing false information to the table don't help. Diminishing the lives and livelihoods of people who live in regional communities and work in industries doesn't help when we're seeking to talk about creating an appropriate and sustainable balance between environmental protection and regional jobs and industries. The approach that has been taken by some participants in this debate to minimise and, indeed, almost set aside the significance of the work and the workers in these industries is a very unfortunate way of approaching a really important debate and a really important set of policy issues.

I will now deal with the remaining Committee of the Whole amendments, starting with further amendments circulated by the opposition on sheet 3339. The question before the committee is that the amendments on sheet 3339, standing in the name of the opposition, be agreed to. Opposition's circulated amendment s —  Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 24), after subsection 78 (3A), insert:  The Minister must not revoke the first decision if:  the first decision was that the action was a controlled action; and  the action is being taken; and  either:  if the Minister is requested under subsection 78A (1) to reconsider the decision—at the time the request is made, the way in which the action is being taken has been ongoing or recurring for at least 5 years; or  otherwise—the way in which the action is being taken has been ongoing or recurring for at least 5 years.  Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 28), omit '78 (3) or (3A)', substitute '78 (3), (3A) or (3B)'.  I will now deal with the Committee of the Whole amendments circulated by the Australian Greens.

Pauline Hanson's One Nation's circulated amendment— At the end of the motion, add ', but the Senate:  notes that:  while acknowledging the important role of TAFE in providing vocational education, private providers and registered training organisations also need to be recognised for the role they play in providing training and education, often with better outcomes for students, and  despite spending $1.5 billion on TAFE there are over 80,000 fewer apprentices and trainees than 3 years ago, with a TAFE course graduation rate of only around 13%, indicating the need for a complete overhaul of the system; and  is of the opinion that free TAFE should be prioritised for Australians and not provided on a fee-free basis to a visa holder'. The question now is that this bill be now read a second time.  I will now deal with the Committee of the Whole amendments circulated by the Jacqui Lambie Network. The question is that the amendments on sheet 3136 be agreed to. Jacqui Lambie Network's circulated amendments—  Clause 8, page 7 (after line 28), after paragraph (1) (g), insert:  the matter set out in section 8A (which deals with the recovery of funding in the event of failing units of study);  Part 3, page 8 (after line 27), at the end of the Part, add: 8A Recovery of funding in the event of failing units of study  For the purposes of paragraph 8 (1) (ga), the matter is the recovery by the State of an amount from a person if:  the person has been enrolled in an FT place in a course; and  the course consists of one or more units of study (the qualifying units); and  the person fails at least three qualifying units. Note: The qualifying units may be different units or the same unit (if the person has enrolled in the same unit more than once).  For the purposes of subsection (1), the amount mentioned in that subsection is equal to the amount of the funding that was provided for each of the qualifying units that the person failed.","Free TAFE Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[8]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","The PRESIDENT ","(22:44):","N/A"

The question is that this bill be read a second time.  I will now deal with the Committee of the Whole amendments, starting with the amendments circulated by the Australian Greens. The question is that the amendments on sheets 3237 and 3243 be agreed to. Australian Greens' c irculated amendments— SHEET 3237  Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 7), after paragraph 3 (1) (b), insert: ; (c) to ensure that NBN Co has a universal service obligation to provide the national broadband network in a way that is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business.  Schedule 1, item 12, page 4 (after line 22), after the paragraph beginning 'Under provisions' in section 43, insert: ‚  Schedule 1, item 13, page 5 (line 7), at the end of section 43A, add: ; and (c) NBN Co has a universal service obligation to provide the national broadband network in a way that is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. ____ SHEET 3243  Page 6 (after line 22), at the end of the bill, add: Schedule 2 — Remuneration amendments National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 1 Section 5 Insert: annualised average weekly earnings: see subsection 92B (2). remuneration cap: see subsection 92B (1). reporting period has the same meaning as in the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. senior executive: see subsection 92C (2). 2 After Part 6 Insert: Part 6A — Remuneration of senior executives Division 1 — Simplified outline 92A Simplified outline The following is a simplified outline of this Part: ‚ This Part imposes requirements on NBN Co that relate to the remuneration of senior executives. This Part also imposes reporting requirements on NBN Co. Division 2 — Remuneration of senior executives 92B Definitions In this part:  The remuneration cap for a senior executive of NBN Co for a period starting in a reporting period is the amount worked out using the formula: where: AAWE means the annualised average weekly earnings for the reporting period for NBN Co.  The annualised average weekly earnings for a reporting period for NBN Co is the amount worked out using the formula: where: AWE (short for average weekly earnings)means the amount published by the Australian Statistician in a document titled 'Average Weekly Earnings' under the headings 'Average Weekly Earnings, Australia—Original—Full-time adult average weekly total earnings' (or, if any of those change, in a replacement document or under replacement headings) for the most recent index reference period before the start of the reporting period. 92C Remuneration of senior executives  Despite any other Act, NBN Co must not pay a senior executive remuneration for a period (the pay period) that would result in the total remuneration of the senior executive for the pay period exceeding the remuneration cap for the pay period.  A person is a senior executive of NBN Co if the person is:  a director or secretary of NBN Co; or  a person (other than a director or secretary, a Minister, or an APS employee engaged as an employee for the purposes of a Commonwealth entity or Commonwealth company other than NBN Co) who:  makes, or participates in making, decisions that affect the whole, or a substantial part, of the operations of NBN Co; or  has the capacity to affect significantly NBN Co's financial standing. Division 3 — Reporting requirements 92D Reporting on remuneration The annual report prepared by NBN Co under section 46 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 for a reporting period must include a statement setting out, for each senior executive of the entity:  the total remuneration for the reporting period; and  the ratio of the total remuneration for the reporting period to the annualised average weekly earnings for the reporting period; and  the ratio of the total weekly remuneration at the end of the reporting period to the national minimum weekly wage set by a national minimum wage order (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act 2009) that is in operation at the end of the reporting period. 3 Application  In this item: amended Act means the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 as amended by this Act. commencement time means the time at which this Schedule commences.  If an arrangement in relation to remuneration between NBN Co and a senior executive of NBN Co is in force immediately before the commencement time, section 92C of the amended Act does not apply in relation to the senior executive until the arrangement expires or is terminated.  If:  immediately before the commencement time, a senior executive of NBN Co has a statutory entitlement to remuneration from NBN Co; and  after the commencement time, NBN Co would, apart from this subitem, contravene section 92C of the amended Act by paying the remuneration in accordance with the entitlement; that section does not apply in relation to the senior executive until the senior executive ceases to have the entitlement.  I'll now deal with the Committee of the Whole amendments circulated by Senator Thorpe. The question is that the amendments on sheet 3305 be agreed to.  Senator Thorpe's circulated amendments—  Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 7), after paragraph 3 (1) (b), insert: ; (c) to ensure that NBN Co has a universal service obligation to provide the national broadband network in a way that is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business, including to people who are in prison or detention.  Schedule 1, item 12, page 4 (after line 22), after the paragraph beginning 'Under provisions' in section 43, insert: ‚  Schedule 1, item 13, page 5 (line 7), at the end of section 43A, add: ; and (c) NBN Co has a universal service obligation to provide the national broadband network in a way that is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business, including to people who are in prison or detention.

The question is that the amendment on sheet 3342 be agreed to.  Australian Greens' circulated amendment— At the end of the motion, add ', but the Senate:  notes that:  these tax cuts will barely scratch the surface for people struggling to pay for food or rent, will not come into effect for 15 months, and will save low-income workers only 73 cents a day, which would not even cover one cup of coffee per week, and  the Government's previous stage three tax cuts delivered $4,500 in tax cuts for billionaires, with these new cuts increasing those savings to more than $5,000 for billionaires like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer; and  calls on the Government to support the Greens' plan to tax big corporations and billionaires to fund what we all need like getting dental and mental health into Medicare, seeing the GP for free, capping rent increases and taking strong climate action'.  The question now is that the bill be read a second time.  I will now deal with the Committee of the Whole amendments circulated by Pauline Hanson's One Nation. The question is that the amendment on sheet 3343 be agreed to. Pauline Hanson's One Nation's circulated amendment—  Page 6 (after line 13), at the end of the Bill, add: Schedule 3 — Indexation of income tax thresholds Income Tax Rates Act 1986 1 Subsection 3 (1) Insert: income tax threshold means the following amounts (subject to indexation under section 20A):  the dollar amount mentioned in the definition of tax-free threshold in this subsection;  each dollar amount mentioned in the tables in clause 1 of Part I of Schedule 7 (table dealing with tax rates for resident taxpayers);  each dollar amount mentioned in the table in clause 1 of Part II of Schedule 7 (table dealing with tax rates for non-resident taxpayers);  each dollar amount mentioned in the table in clause 1 of Part III of Schedule 7 (table dealing with tax rates for working holiday makers). 2 At the end of Part II Add: Division 5 — Indexation of income tax thresholds 20A Indexation of income tax thresholds Indexation  On 1 July 2025 and each later 1 July (the indexation day), each income tax threshold is replaced by the amount worked out using the following formula:  However, subsection (1) does not apply for an indexation day if the indexation factor for the indexation day is 1 or less.  The amount worked out under subsection (1) is to be rounded to the nearest whole dollar (rounding 50 cents upwards). Indexation factor  The indexation factor for an indexation day is the number worked out using the following formula: Note: For index number, reference quarter and base quarter see subsection (8).  The indexation factor is to be worked out to 3 decimal places (rounding up if the fourth decimal place is 5 or more). Changes to CPI index reference period and publication of substituted index numbers  Amounts are to be worked out under this section:  using only the index numbers published in terms of the most recently published index reference period for the Consumer Price Index; and  disregarding index numbers published in substitution for previously published index numbers (except where the substituted numbers are published to take account of changes in the index reference period). Publication of income tax thresholds  The Commissioner must, by notifiable instrument, publish the amounts worked out under subsection (1) for an indexation day as soon as practicable before the indexation day. Definitions  In this section: base quarter means the last March quarter before the reference quarter. index number, for a quarter, means the All Groups Consumer Price Index number (being the weighted average of the 8 capital cities) published by the Australian Statistician for that quarter. March quarter means a period of 3 months starting on 1 January. reference quarter means the last March quarter before the indexation day.","Treasury Laws Amendment (More Cost of Living Relief) Bill 2025","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[10]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","The PRESIDENT ","(23:10):","N/A"
