"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","41","HARDY, Charles","KNZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I have taken this course to enable honorable senators to discuss what I consider an unprecedented act of political expediency by the Lyons Government to hold the federal elections on the 15th September, approximately five months before the date on which they would ordinarily be held. There is neither rhyme nor reason in abandoning a national work of reconstruction and plunging the nation into a welter of uncertainty. There is no excuse for any government substituting political strategy for a policy of national progress. The decision to appeal to the people six months before the constitutional term of Parliament will expire is inexplicable not only to the general public, but also to members of this Parliament, and it is evidence of the control by certain political strategists which has characterized the whole of the Lyons administration. It cannot be denied that two and a half years ago the present Government was elected by an overwhelming majority. It was then felt by the people that the Government would undertake fearlessly the national work of reconstruction needed, showing favour to none, and governing for the benefit of the whole of the people, regardless of class or creed. The electors who have watched the progress of this Government, with varying feelings, are astounded to learn that after a recess of seven months Parliament is to be dissolved at the voluntary request of the Prime Minister. Is it any wonder that people are asking-and the question is likely to remain unanswered-why an appeal is being made to the people when the work for which the Government was elected remains incomplete? Is there any excuse for abandoning a programme of national legislation merely in order to gain a tactical advantage over other political parties? Is there any excuse why vital legislation should not be dealt with during the next six months instead of playing ducks and drakes with the political stability of this country? Surely it is the duty of any government, regardless of its political creed, to carry its responsibility through to the end of its term rather than to sidestep the difficult problems that lie ahead. When the Leader of the Senate was asked last week to state the reasons which actuated the Government in this matter, he said that the Prime Minister would announce the reasons in the House of Representatives. The date of the election was announced, but the Prime Minister has not yet explained to Parliament the reasons for such an irresponsible decision. The National Parliament has had to be content to read a statement issued by the Prime Minister through the press, and which, for all practical purposes, is about as useful as a ship in dry dock. In that statement which, I presume, must represent the official views of the Government, the Prime Minister said-","Formal Motion for Adjournment","FEDERAL ELECTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The Prime Minister, with the aid of a rise in export prices of about 40 per cent.-a fact which he does not mention-has balanced his budget, but whether confidence has been restored is debatable. The Tasmanian electors did not think so, as a Nationalist Government in that State has been thrown out of office. Perhaps the matter of confidence is worrying the Prime Minister, and that may be his real reason for the early appeal to the country. I admit that conditions are improving. Why, it is even reported that the farmers in the Riverina are taking their bills out of the envelopes. Still, the Prime Minister may find that his confidence is misplaced. It is cheerfully and thankfully admitted that the budget is balanced, but it is not my purpose on this occasion to say at what cost. I dismiss the first part of his statement, and allow the credit-if there is any-to go to the Government, but it is the next sentence in his statement to which I direct attention.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","41","HARDY, Charles","KNZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The intention is clear; the words allow no misinterpretation. It is a simple, bald statement by Australia's first citizen that the country now faces the problem of rural rehabilitation. This shows the difference, clearly and sharply, between the United Australia party and the United Country party. The members of the Country party have been under the impression, for the past three years, that unless the primary industries are given a policy of rehabilitation, all engaged in such industries must become bankrupt o* remain on their farms as tenants for vested interests. We have argued and pleaded for these measures both in season and out of season, and there have been instances in this chamber where our appeals for rural rehabilitation have fallen on deaf ears And now the Prime Minister ' (Mr. Lyons), as a reason for this election six months before it need take place, states that the country is crying out for a policy of rural rehabilitation. Rip Van Winkle! It is a pity this cry was not recognized three years ago. The Parliament has over six months of its constitutional term of office yet. to run, and the Government, if it is sincerely desirous of effectuating a rural policy, has still ample time to do it by postponing the election till the proper date, and getting down to solid constructive work for the next six months. It would then be able to refute the statement that it has been like a taxi driver, going through life just missing everything. It is admitted in the statement that, on all matters including visionary rural rehabilitation, the Government has a vital policy, but requires these questions to be submitted to the people. Why? That is a logical question, and one the Government can attempt to answer. Surely, if a policy has been formulated during the life of the Government, one may logically ask, ' Why has this policy, in view of the urgent need of .the men on the land, not been put into operation? Why let it hibernate, while a harassed nation mills around like a flock of sheep?' Is this the policy of the political strategists? If so, it is one that sacrifices the advancement of the nation on the altar of party tactics. In the work that remains undone by the present Government, the tariff and assistance to primary industry rank foremost. I shall not weary the Senate by a repetition of the Lyons Government's tariff record, but it is pertinent to inquire why over 60 reports by the Tariff Board, which have been received by the Government, have not been released for the consideration of this Parliament. The Government has' always claimed that it should be guided by the Tariff Board's recommendations. Surely the Government does not contemplate, in order to defeat the purpose of this pledge made in the policy speech of the Prime Minister, that those reports shall be allowed to lie undisturbed on the Cabinet table, and to become covered with dust. What do these reports contain? Are they all in favour of those who advocate low duties, irrespective of the effect on Australian industries, or do they advocate the retention of present duties? Obviously, a serious change must have been recommended; otherwise the reports would not be withhold by the Government. Are they being suppressed in view of the coming election? The release of the reports would cause a re-action in the ranks of those government supporters who advocate a manufacturing Australia. Election or no election, the obvious fluty of the Government is to table the reports, and not allow the allegation to be made that the election will be fought under false tariff colours. Rumour is, of course, a lying jade, but sometimes rumour is correct, and rumour hath it ,that the political strategists are determined to keep the reports an unknown quantity until after the election. Again, I am not prepared at this stage to detail the many sins of the Lyons Government in connexion with the wheat industry. I shall not stress the fact that the previous budget contained no reference to wheat relief, but I do emphasize that the Government has no right to appeal to the country until it has solved this problem. Repeatedly, it has avoided the issue with an agility worthy of an acrobat. A commission has been appointed to investigate the wheat industry. There is no doubt that the report will be wide in scope and effect. Its fulfilment will either usher in a new era of prosperity for the wheat grower, or throw the whole industry into chaos. Why not defer the election until the report is tabled? The plain duty of the present Government is to stay in office and place the wheat industry on a sound footing, instead of rushing to the country with a pyramid of promises as to what it will do if returned. The Government can remain in office, if it so desires, for another six months. It should do so, and cope with the wheat problem. If the Government seeks election without placing this great industry on a sound basis, it will be adding the last straw that will break the camel's back. I am frequently in touch with the primary producers, and I know that they will not tolerate any government that offers only a mass of promises, and has no record of achievement. Will the Leader of the Senate (Senator Pearce) state the intention of the Government regarding the Petrol Commission? Is this also to be a post-election policy, as well as' rural rehabilitation, the necessity for which Mr. Lyons appears to have just discovered? Are we to apply the famous 'wait and see' policy to this important subject as well as to wheat and the tariff? In regard to subsidized foreign shipping, 1 am astonished that the Government has done nothing to deflect this attack on British vessels. Mention could he made of the various constitutional arn end ments proposed in the policy speech of Mr. Lyons, but these matters only tend to widen the difference of opinion that exists between, those people who think that it is high time that the Lyons Government should get something done, and those who .think that the Lyons Government has done enough. Frankly, I have never believed that the Lyons Government has had any sympathy with the primary producers of this country. It is not a friend of the man on the land, and has never given adequate assistance to our great exporting industries. I protest vigorously against the decision of the Government to hold an election on the 15th September. Unless the Government were defeated in the meantime, the proper time for it to account to the electors for its administration would be after the 17th February, 1935.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","FEDERAL ELECTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Generally, .Federal elections have been held in November or December. The Government obtained a mandate at the last election to balance the budget and restore confidence and credit. This mandate has been fully carried out. The country now faces the problems of rural rehabilitation, markets for our produce, trade treaties, prevention of the restriction of our exports of primary .products, adequate defence, and continuance of sound finance and Empire cooperation. On all these vital questions the Government has a definite policy, but the proposals which the Government has formulated on these matters have not been submitted to the people. The Government desires once more to obtain a fresh mandate from the people to enable it to carry out its policy in respect to those mutters. All the subjects mentioned need urgent attention and action. An early election is, therefore. ' gi the interest of the people, in order that a Parliament duly authorized by the people to deal with these vital and important questions may be elected as soon as possible. It would obviously be undesirable to have an election during the Royal visit. To postpone the election until after the departure of the Royal guest would mean that the election would have to be held in January or February, when harvesting is proceeding in some States, a period which, from a climatic point of view, is the most unsuitable time of the year. The members of the Parliament who may not he re-elected suffer a pecuniary loss by. an early election, but the people will reap the benefit of being given a voice in determining how these Policies are to he shaped, and by whom they are to be given effect to.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","FEDERAL ELECTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","56","Senator Sir GEORGE","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","If the Government had so poor an opinion of itself, it would not make a declaration such as that, or take the proposed action, which is the clearest possible indication of its confidence in the verdict of the people. It has no doubt at all that its record in the last two and a half years, together with the policy which it will place before the people, will ensure its return to office and guarantee stable government in the federal sphere for another three years. < Certain aspects of the problems upon which the Government proposes to seek a fresh mandate had not arisen when this Parliament went to the country on the last occasion. Take, for instance, the marketing of our rural products. The Ottawa Conference had not then been held and since that gathering the acute nationalism, which has developed in some countries has created serious problems in connexion with the marketing of their products, and to those problems the Ottawa agreement does not supply a complete answer. The finding of new markets and the making of trade treaties have become acute problems, and the Government must have a policy regarding them. It is equally important for the Government to know that it has the authority of the people, to put such a policy into operation. The honorable senator declared that the Government is holding back reports by the Tariff Board. It is a fact that some 60 reports are available, but it is eminently desirable that they should not be tabled until the Government is able to say what action it proposes concerning them, and to implement that action with the consent of both branches of the legislature. In those reports certain rates of duty are recommended by the board. If the reports were tabled, and action were not taken on them immediately, clever importers, and, for that matter, manufacturers too, could gain an advantage by gambling on the possible action to be taken by the Government. As the election is to be held in September, it will be impossible for both Houses to have a full discussion on the board's reports on 60 items, and legislate on them, as well as deal with all the matters that will arise out of the budget proposals of the Government. It is clear that if the reports were laid on the table in the House of Representatives, all that Parliament could do would be to pass an act validating the new duties, but would that be satisfactory? Honorable senators know that on one occasion we had to validate a whole host of duties upon which this Senate had had no opportunity to express its opinion. Surely that is not a proper exercise of the legislative power of this chamber. Therefore, to those who would safeguard the interests of the Senate, I suggest that, as the elections will be held in September, it is far better that each House should have an opportunity to discuss freely and vote upon the proposals of the Tariff Board regarding all those items. I desire to correct Senator Hardy. I do not know whether he deliberately tried to misconstrue the Prime Minister's remarks, but 1 challenge him to produce any statement ever made by my leader, at any time and in any place, that he would always accept the recommendations of the Tariff Board. What he did say was that the policy of the Government was to refrain from altering duties without first obtaining a report by the board, but the Ministry has never pledged itself to accept every recommendation submitted by the board. It must make up its own mind regarding any duty in the light of the board's report and recommendation. But, obviously, it cannot commit itself to accept, every such recommendation. The honorable senator went on to say that the Government has no right to go to the country until it has announced its policy. Of course, it will announce its policy when it goes to the country. Surely no democrat can object to that procedure, which amounts to placing the people, in a sense, before the Parliament. The matters awaiting immediate attention were not under consideration by the people at the last election, and consequently, they have never expressed an opinion regarding them; so the Government, in taking its policy to the country, is showing that it believes in the rule of the people. The policy of the Government regarding the wheat industry was also questioned by the honorable senator. The Government has already announced that the royal commission that has been inquiring into the position of the wheat industry will submit an interim report before the end of the present session. The chairman of the commission has informed the Prime Minister that this will be done, so I suggest to Senator Hardy that after the receipt of the interim report will be the appropriate time for the Government to state what action it proposes to take upon the matter. The Government does not know any more than does the honorable senator what that interim report will contain. Obviously, it would be foolish on the Government's part to anticipate the report, and it is unreasonable on the part of the honorable senator to ask it to commit itself regarding a report which it has not yet seen.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","FEDERAL ELECTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[5]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In its two years and a half of office, it has done its utmost, within the limits imposed by the financial condition of the country, to afford relief to wheat-farmers, whose desperate plight was due to the catastrophic decline of the overseas market, and, on each occasion, notwithstanding the taunts of Senator Hardy and some others, it acted in sufficient time for the harvest. It refused to be stampeded then, as it refuses to be stampeded now, in regard to its policy for the relief of rural producers. It also introduced and passed last year a measure providing for the payment of a bounty on the purchase of fertilizers required by primary producers other than wheat-growers. Its action in this respect has been appreciatively referred to by many primary producers, who declared that it was of the greatest assistance to them. The Government also, last year, brought in a bill for the assistance of growers of apples and pears in a number of States. I would further remind Senator Hardy that its proposals for relief from taxation-the remissions in respect of special customs and primage duties imposed by the Scullin Government, as well as the sales tax-were brought down in the interests of primary producers, the desire being to remove, as far as possible, the burden which had been placed upon rural industries by the previous Administration. Those measures benefited the primary industries of this country to the amount of millions of pounds. Yet this gentleman, who pretends to represent the rural interests, has the audacity to say that during its two and a half years' term of office this Government has done nothing for primary industries. It will-need more than the eloquence of Senator Hardy, more than the frothy mouthings of this platform orator from the western districts of New South Wales, to hide from the people the actual Achievements of the governments. Apparently, the honorable senator submitted his motion without regard to the actual facts, but with the sole desire to injure, not only the United Australia party, but also the United Country party at the forthcoming election.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","FEDERAL ELECTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[11]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I am not, at the moment, concerned with the domestic quarrel that has taken place between the Government and members of the United Country party. These differences of opinion are aired for the purpose of persuading the-people that those who indulge in them really mean what they say. We all know that, when the time comes, the two sections will become united for their individual and collective gain. But when the Leader of the Senate takes to the Government full credit for the improvement that has taken place in the financial and economic conditions of Australia during the last two and a half years, it is as well that the actual facts should be placed before the people. The right honorable gentleman said that it was the desire of the Government to present to the electors certain proposals for dealing with the major problems that confront Australia at the moment. He emphasized that it was taking this course now because it believed in the democratic principle of asking the people for a new mandate. But if the Government really believed that the people should be unfettered in their choice of representatives for this Parliament, why have the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons), the Leader of the Senate, and other Ministers, been negotiating during the last few weeks with Dr. Earle Page, the Leader of the Country party, and Mr. Paterson, the Deputy Leader of that party? Is it not a fact that these conferences have been held for the purpose of restricting the choice of the people in certain electoral divisions for the House of Representatives, and also determining what candidates shall offer themselves for election to the Senate? Is it right that a small coterie, which may be described as a preselection committee, should decide these important issues? If the Government really believes in freedom of choice by the people, why does not it allow all the candidates to face the electors, irrespective of the parties to which they belong? Why is it necessary to conduct these negotiations, and why should the parties in conference order the retirement of certain candidates in order to ensure the return of others? It should be remembered that during the whole of these negotiations, which have received a great deal of publicity in the newspapers, we have not heard one word about public policy; there has been no reference to those vital problems with which this Parliament should have the opportunity to deal. Apparently the whole of the discussion has centred in the question whether, for the Senate election in certain States, three United Australia party candidates or two United Australia party candidates and one Country party candidate should constitute the 'antiLabour team. Some illuminating comments on this subject appeared recently in a leading article in the Melbourne Age.

Accordingly, the Government ha3 determined on a last desperate throw. It has resolved to appeal to the people, hoping, perhaps, that the fear of defeat-may force the refractory elements within the ranks of the respective parties to cease their hostility so that the two clements may become united and stave off the defeat which the Government's record merits. The Leader of the Senate quoted extensively the Prime Minister's statement of the reasons for an early appeal to the people. 'We are told that the Government is seeking a mandate to do certain things, especially in relation to primary industries. Has the Government any effective policy for the rehabilitation of the rural industries of this country-any scheme to rescue our wheatfanners, butter producers, and meat exporters from their present desperate position? All sections of primary industry, with the exception, perhaps, of the wool-growers, are in difficulties. The improved position of wool-growers is due entirely to a very opportune increase of wool values during the latter portion of the last selling season. The higher prices received were mainly responsible for the healthier condition of Australian trade, and for the improved financial position of this country to-day. The relief received by the wool-growers may not be maintained, because the disquieting reports received from overseas have already resulted in the postponement of wool sales here, with a consequent collapse of prices. It may not be long before the whole of Australia's primary industries are in the same unfortunate position as in the first two years of this Government's period of office. During that time honorable senators on this side of the chamber repeatedly pleaded with the Government to evolve a definite plan to afford immediate and effective relief to those engaged in primary production, but to such requests the Government turned a deaf ear. It was not until the last moment that it was stampeded into assisting the wheat-growers, and then only by paying them a bounty. If the Government has a practical policy to afford real relief to the primary producers, it does not require to go to the people for a mandate. It can receive a mandate from this Parliament. I am safe in asserting, on behalf of honorable senators on this side of the chamber, that any practical policy submitted by the Government for the relief of primary producers will receive our unanimous support. If the Government is assured of the asssistance of its own supporters and of ours, why is it necessary to hold a general election? Why should it reduce the life of this Parliament? Why does it not shoulder its responsibilities instead of postponing what it proposes to do, and thus compelling those engaged in primary production to face further uncertainty? If the Government requires any assistance in resisting proposals to restrict exports from Australia, it will have the support of honorable senators on this side of the chamber.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","FEDERAL ELECTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

My only objection to the date chosen for the appeal to the people is that an election for the Senate will take place at the same time as that for the House of Representatives, and that, as there will no doubt be a clearing out of certain members of the Senate, those senators will retain their seats in the Senate, and take a part in shaping the policy of the country for nine months after their rejection.

If I were under a charge of murder, and had to depend for my acquittal on a case no stronger than that made out by the honorable senator, I should certainly fear for my life. The honorable senator quoted from the Constitution to show that the Parliament may not subsist for more than three years; and he has argued that it is within the power of the Government in office to determine whether that period should be shorter. I admit that, with the consent of the Governor-General, the Government can arrange for a dissolution of Parliament whenever it chooses; but that is not evidence of the desirability of such action. Obviously, when three years was fixed as the duration of the House of Representatives, it was believed that that period would best suit the convenience of the electors, and at the same time be a compromise between the old system of parliaments with a long life and the more expensive and disturbing system of parliaments of short duration. The point at issue now is whether the Government is justified in asking the people for a fresh mandate. Before that is sought, the Government should attempt to exhaust the mandate upon which it was returned to power. It would be colossal audacity on the part of Ministers or any of their supporters to claim that they have carried out their last mandate. The two most urgent matters on which the Government received instructions from the electors were the abolition, practically, of unemployment and the restoration of the financial stability of the country, which includes the rehabilitation of the wheat industry. The concessions made to the wheat-growers in recent years have been part of a hand-to-month, stop-gap policy; there has been no orderly plan of assistance. When harvest time drew near, two million pounds or more was handed out to tide the' farmers over their immediate troubles.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","FEDERAL ELECTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","91","RAE, Arthur","K1Z","N/A","N/A","N/A","361","I am not concerned about that aspect, of the matter. The obvious duty of the Government is to have a planned policy, instead of giving the farmers assistance almost on the eve of the harvest when they are in despair as to how the industry is to be maintained. The mere fact that the difficulties of the farmers would largely disappear if the price of wheat rose quickly, is no justification for neglecting to establish a wellordered plan of relief. Reference was made by the Leader of the Senate (Senator Pearce) to the fact that the members of my party and other honorable senators on the Opposition side rose in support of the motion which is now under discussion. I would always be prepared to rise in support of an honorable senator desirous of discussing a matter of public importance, even if I utterly disapproved of his views regarding it, provided the motion was not submitted deliberately for the purpose of wasting time. Although the right honorable gentleman jibed at Labour senators for rising on this occasion, I expected that he would make a personal attack on Senator Hardy judging by the violence of his utterances, and his apparent excitement. I challenge anybody to prove that this Government has carried out its mandate in any way. Take its claim that unemployment has diminished by a fairly large percentage since the Government assumed office. Admitting that statistics show that the percentage of unemployment has decreased considerably since the peak period, the Government has adopted the mean policy of paying men engaged on relief work a mere fraction of full time wages. The unemployed in my State, who go on the roster for unemployment relief work, are immediately counted as ' employed ', and if that practice is meant to deceive the public it is a wickedimposition. Yet that is why the unemployment figures have been reduced. 1 attended a recent deputation to the Minister for Labour in New South 'Wales who stated that the unemployment relief tax collected in that State was paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and that all the relief works were financed from funds advanced by the Loan Council. Thus all the 'prosperity' is due to the expenditure of loan money, and in 99 cases out of 100 the relief work is not of a reproductive nature. This is a handtomouth policy which can result only in a greater collapse ultimately than that already suffered, because we cannot continue to float loans on the strength of the confidence allegedly restored by the present Government. In one year about £3S,000,000 has been raised by loans, and these have piled up the national debt and increased the interest burden. It is claimed that great relief has come from the conversion of some of our overseas loans at lower rates of interest; but, while some saving in interest payments has thus been made, so much additional money has been borrowed that the aggregate interest bill has increased and is gradually absorbing the whole of the revenue. With such a Micawber-like policy, there could not be a. return to real prosperity. It i3 a matter for concern that an attempt is made to solve one problem by creating another. This policy mint eventually plunge the country into a state of more dire poverty than has ever previously been experienced. The Leader of the Senate must admit that during the regime of the Scullin Government, when Mr. Parker Moloney was the Minister for Markets, considertion was given to the provision of a system of orderly marketing of primary products, and that the subject was discussed in Parliament by members of the present Government. So it cannot truthfully be said that this is a new problem. The suggestion that a fresh mandate from the people is required to enable the primary producers to be given markets for their produce is unadulterated humbug. As to the date of the general election, the Leader of the Senate remarked that we could not have it much later than September without interfering with the Royal visit, and it could not be held before Christmas because His Royal Highness would not like to see Australia in the throes of a political wrangle. Senator Brennan, stated that the election should not take place at Christmas time. It was further pointed out that in January, although most of the harvesting would then have been finished, the wheat had to be carted to the silos and railway sidings. After the bush-fire danger had passed, the farmers, of course, would be busy ploughing and sowing the next crop. When the ploughing has been done and the winter has set in, nobody wants an election, so no time of the year is convenient for it. An excuse can always be found for either holding or not holding an election.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","FEDERAL ELECTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

When I believe that I am right, I intend to say what is in my mind without fear of any party.

I am afraid, that the right honorable gentleman's sight must be failing, because every member of the Country party in the chamber at the time rose to support me.

If it wishes to tackle these complex matters, it will have the support of country members.

Successive Commonwealth governments have recognized the difficult position of Tasmania, and since 1912 special financial assistance has been provided. In 1929 the special grant was fixed at £250,000 a year for live years. Supplementary ' depression ' grants were made of £80,000 in 1932-33, and £130,000 in 1933-34. The grants paid since 1912 aggregate £3,720,000. In 1924 the Commonwealth gave up to Tasmania its taxation on lottery prizes, which then yielded £111,000 a year, and is now probably worth £50,000 per annum. Under the Federal Aid Roads Agreement Tasmania last year received £110,000, half of which was really contributed by petrol-users of other States. Other special assistance given last year to Tasmania included £04,000 for relief to fruit-growers, and special assistance of £45,000 while the flour tax was in operation. Substantial assistance lias also been provided for improved shipping services, telephone communication, and air services. Since 1921-22 the regular items of direct assistance, viz., financial agreement, special grants, and road grants, have more than doubled, viz., 1921-22 £300,000, 1933-34 £790,000, an increase of £430.000. Tasmania has also derived substantial benefits from the financial agreement and the Loan Council. Finance has been arranged hy the Loan Council for Tasmania during the period of depression, when the markets were no longer open, and savings in the conversion loans carried out by the Loan Council exceed £200,000.","TASMANIA AND SECESSION","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It has been the policy of the German Government for some years to encourage local cereal production by various means, with the result that importations have progressively declined. The quantity of Australian wheat imported into Germany has not been substantial, in recent years, compared with our total exports. Germany is a valuable market for Australian fresh fruit (apples and pears) and the trade over the last few years has been fairly well maintained. It is possible that the exchange difficulties and reduced purchasing power of the German public will reduce imports of fresh fruit, in common with other commodities. It is a fact that the London wool sales, which opened on the 3rd July, have shown a substantial decline in prices, the decline being most marked in respect of merino wool. The demand, according to information in possession of the Government, was very irregular and a large percentage of the earlier catalogues was withdrawn. The influences which tend to have a detrimental effect on Australian exports to Germany have been brought about by German domestic policy, together with the measures taken by the German Government to combat the unfavorable trend of Germany's export trade. In regard to the action which was contemplated by Great Britain to protect the interests of British bondholders, consequent on the suspension of transfers on Germany's foreign debts, the British Government has reached a satisfactory agreement with Germany. Thus, the danger of retaliatory action by Germany, which would probably have affected Australian trade with that country, has been avoided.","GERMAN IMPORT RESTRICTIONS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","124","PEARCE, George","K0F","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","This is the first of three redistribution proposals, the adoption of which I propose to move. The other two-relate to the States of New South Wales and Queensland. I desire, in the first place, to explain to the Senate why this proposed distribution is being dealt with first. As honorable senators are aware, the Representation Act 1905 provides for a quinquennial determination of the number of members to be chosen by each State of the Commonwealth. The determination takes place after each census, and also at a date approximately intermediate between the census dates. The determination made recently was based upon the figures disclosed by the census held on the 30th June, 1933. The application of the provisions of the Representation Act to those figures has the effect of reducing, from seven to six, the number of members to be chosen by the State of South Australia. This is the only proposed redistribution which provides for a variation of the number of members to be chosen by a State. Some of the proposed redistributions of other States might be adopted. If they were taken first, and subsequently the proposed redistribution of South Australia were rejected, an amendment of the law might in certain events become necessary. lt is, therefore, highly desirable that the proposed redistribution of South Australia should first be dealt with. This is the first occasion on record in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament, upon which it has been necessary for consideration to be given to redistribution proposals involving a loss of representation by one State without a corresponding gain by another State. For this reason the Government has given long and anxious consideration to the proposal, with a view to endeavouring to find another method of distribution which, consistently with the Constitution, would permit of the retention by South Australia of its seventh member. When the number of members is large, the loss or gain of one member does not appear to be of quite such moment as is the case when the number of members is already small, as in the case of South Australia. I regret that, although the Government has given careful consideration to the subject, it has not been able to discover any method by which, consistently with the provisions of the Constitution, the retention may be effected. I propose now to deal shortly with the operation of the provisions of the Constitution and of Commonwealth legislation relating to the determination of the number of members to be chosen in each State. As honorable senators are aware, section 24 of the Constitution contains two guiding principles in relation to the number of members to be chosen to represent a State. They are-That the number of members shall be as nearly as practicable twice the number of senators; and That the number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people. The section then goes on to provide a method of determining the number of members to be chosen by each State, this method to remain in force until Parliament otherwise provides. The Parliament has ' otherwise provided ' by the Representation Act 1905. The only alteration made by the Representation Act of the method of determining the number of members is the-substitution for the number of the people as set out in the statistics of the Commonwealth, of the number of people as set forth in a certificate to be issued by the Chief Electoral Officer. For the purpose of the preparation of such a certificate the Chief Electoral Officer must obtain the necessary statistical information from statistical officers of the Commonwealth. Broadly, the method of determining the number is as follows :-A quota is ascertained by dividing the number of the people of the Commonwealth by twice the number of senators, i.e., by 72, and The number of members to be chosen in each State is determined by dividing the number of people of each State by the quota so ascertained, and in the case of any State where the remainder is greater than one-half of the quota, by giving that State an additional member. This method of determining the number of members is expressed in the Representation Act as being subject to the Constitution-a provision which was, no doubt, intended primarily to safeguard those States which, under the Constitution, were entitled to the minimum representation of five members. Under section 26 of the Constitution the number of members to be chosen at the first election was as follows:-New South Wales, 26; Victoria, 23; Queensland, 9; South Australia, 7; Western Australia, 5; Tasmania, 5, making a total of 75 members. The operation of the foregoing provisions of the Constitution and of the Representation Act has .resulted in the following changes :-In 1907, New South Wales gained a member at the expense of Victoria.' In 1913, Queensland gained a member at the expense of Victoria. In 1923, New South Wales gained another member at the expense of Victoria. The representation of the States in the present Parliament is, therefore, as follows :-New South Wales, 2S; Victoria, 20; Queensland, 10; South Australia, 7; Western Australia, 5; Tasmania, 5. The total membership of the House, has, however, remained constant ever since the establishment of federation. As already stated, the operation of the Representation Act upon the population figures disclosed at the recent census has had the effect of reducing from seven to six the number of members allocated to South Australia. The figures upon which this reduction is based are as follows :-I now propose to refer to a suggestion that has been put forward that consideration of the approval of the distribution should be postponed pending an amendment of the Representation Act. That act now provides that, if on the division of the number of people of a State by the quota, there is a remainder greater than one-half of the quota, one more member shall be chosen in the State. It has been suggested that the law should be amended so as to provide that, if on such division, there is in the case of a State having less than ten members a remainder greater than .3 of the quota, and in the case of a State having tcn or more members, a remainder greater than one-half of the quota, one more member shall be chosen in the State. It is claimed that for the purposes of determining equal representation regard should be paid, not only to the actual population, but also to the electoral population. As applied to the actual population of the States, this would produce the. following result:-The existing method provides for the following variation on a population basis :-The application of these two methods to the electoral population produces the following results:-For the first time, Western Australia becomes entitled to five members on the basis of population. From the foregoing it will be seen that, so far as population is concerned, the existing method provides a range of variation per member in the States other than Tasmania, of 9,429; i.e., between South Australia and Western Australia, while the proposal referred to provides a range of 11,429, i.e., between Queensland and South Australia. On the other hand, taking the electoral population instead of the whole population, the existing method provides a range of 11,304, i.e, between South Australia and Western Australia, while the proposed new method provides a range of 7,672, i.e., between Victoria and Western Australia. Thus, on the basis of the whole population, the existing method provides a closer approximation . to equal representation than does the proposed new method. But on the basis of the electoral population, the new method provides a closer approximation to equal representation than does the existing method. The question arises as to which population should be chosen as a basis, the whole population or the electoral population. On the one hand, it is suggested that the electoral population only should bechosen, while, on the other hand, there is the suggestion that both should be taken into account. A study of section 24 of the Constitution will, however, establish that it is only the total population which should be considered. That section, as has been pointed out, contains two guiding principles-That the number of members of the House of Representatives shall be as nearly as practicable twice the number of the senators; and That the number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people. Honorable senators will note, from the second of these principles that it is the numbers of the people which must be taken, and the number of members must be in proportion to the numbers of the people, not the numbers of the electors. Thus, while the proposed new method does actually give a closer approximation to equal representation of the electoral population, it does not conform to the second of these principles, inasmuch as it does not provide representation in proportion to the numbers of the people. It should be noted, also, that it does not conform as closely as the existing method to the first principle, in that it provides for a House of 75, while the existing method provides for a House of 74. In accordance with the first principle of section 24 of the Constitution, the number of members of the House of Representatives must be as nearly as practicable twice the number of senators, viz., 72. It is true that for the purpose of the distribution of a State into divisions it is the electoral population which is taken, and not the whole population. The Parliament, however, has a free hand in this matter, and is not limited by the terms of the Constitution to basing its distribution on the numbers of the people. Such a method would, in fact, 'bo impracticable, except after a census; for, while the Commonwealth Statistician can estimate the population of a State, it would be impossible for him to estimate with any degree of accuracy the population of any particular division. The question then arises as to whether there is any method by which the State of South Australia could be allowed to retain a seventh seat, seeing that no other State is entitled to an additional seat. One method which may be thought available to Parliament is the rejection of successive proposed, redistributions providing for six members, with a view to the continuance of the existing distribution of the State of South Australia into seven divisions. For this . purpose reliance is placed on section 12 of the Representation Act 1905, which reads:-When in pursuance of a certificate under this act an alteration takes place in the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen in any State the alteration shall not affect-any election held before the States have been redistributed into electoral divisions pursuant to the certificate; nor any election to fill a vacancy in a House of Representatives elected before such redistribution, but shall affect any general election after such redistribution. In the opinion of the Government, the adoption of this course would be fraught with serious consequences. It may be that the duty imposed upon the Parliament by the Constitution, the Representation Act, and the Commonwealth Electoral Act, is a duty of imperfect obligation, that is, a duty for the enforcement of which there is no legal provision. On the other hand, it may be that the effect of the continued disregard of the provisions of the Constitution, and of the acts in question, would lead to the holding of an invalid election. Whether there are or are not legal means for the enforcement of the provisions of the Constitution and of the acts in question, the Government feels that a matter of principle is involved, and that no justification exists for the rejection of a proposed redistribution merely on the ground that it provides for six members only, whereas under existing conditions a State has seven members. As previously stated, very careful consideration has been given ' to the whole subject, with a view, if possible, to retaining the present membership for the State of South Australia, but the Government has not been able to discover any method consistent with the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth by which that result may be achieved. Apart from the foregoing constitutional objections to the proposal, there is another strong objection. The existing method of determining the representation of States in the House of Representatives has been embedded in Commonwealth legislation for nearly 30 years. It is in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and it accords also with the very general practice, adoptod in making calculations, of treating a fraction in excess of one-half as a whole number. To make a change in the method of determining the number of members, not on general principles, but merely in order to suit the circumstances of some particular State, would be to create a very undesirable precedent, and on this ground also I ask the Senate not to give countenanceto the proposed alteration of the method. The matters which distribution commissioners are required to consider in determining their distribution are set out in section 19 of the Electoral Act, which reads-19.In making any proposed distribution of a State into divisions., the distribution commissioners shall give due consideration to-Existing boundaries of divisions and subdivisions; and subject thereto the quota of electors shall be the basis for the distribution, and the distribution commissioners may adopt a margin of allowance, to be used whenever necessary, but in no case shall the quota bo departed from to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less. The number of electors in the State of South Australia was ascertained to be 342,019, and the quota therefore is 57,003. The margin of allowance of one-fifth more or one-fifth less, amounting to 11,400, accordingly made the minimum permissible number of electors in any division 45,603 and the maximum permissible number 68.403. The numbers of electors enrolled for each of the existing divisions at the time of the last distribution in 1922, and im mediately prior to the present redistribution were:-The numbers of electors in each of the proposed new divisions, together with the extent to which these numbers differ from the quota are as follow:-Under the proposals the average number of electors in each of the three metropolitan divisions will be 61,499, while the average in each of the three extra metropolitan divisions will be 52,507. I ask the Senate to approve of the proposed distribution.

It. is desirable, therefore, that the phrase used in section 17 should be amended to read ' new or original '. This amendment is proposed in clause 2. The other amendment relates to section 29 of the act, which requires the owner of a registered design to cause each article to which the design is applied to be marked before delivery for sale with the prescribed mark to denote that the design is registered. The imperial act imposes a similar obligation, but empowers the Board of Trade to make rules dispensing with, or modifying, the requirements with respect to any class or description of articles to such extent and subject to such conditions as the board thinks fit. That dispensation is prescribed under the imperial act in respect of all textile goods which are cut after leaving the factory, and it appears to be desirable that provision should be made for granting similar exemptions in the Commonwealth. The bill is practically a machinery measure, and I confidently commend it to the Senate.","Second Reading","DESIGNS BILL 1934","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The rate of primage duty, which at that time was 2½ per cent., was increased in November, 1930, to 4 per cent. In July, 1931, the principal rate was made 10 per cent., in accordance with the Premiers plan, while the rate in respect of certain raw materials, machines, and goods affecting the primary producer remained at 4 per cent. Since then many exemptions have been made, and the rate on various goods, mainly those used by our primary industries, has been reduced to 4 per cent. The primage duties proposals of the 4th October, 1933, reduced the primage duty on goods eligible for admission under the British preferential tariff, and subject to protective duties under the Customs Tariff, from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent. The two main reasons for this action were-(1) To give effect, as far as the finances would permit, to the Tariff Board's recommendation on the protective incidence of primage duties; and (2) to carry out, as far as could be done under the then financial conditions, Australia's obligations, under article 14 of the United Kingdom and Australia trade agreement, in respect of primage on British goods. Relief to the amount of approximately £585,000 has 'been given by the reductions in primage duties made in connexion with the budget for 1933-34. The revenue derived from primage duties forms a substantial item of the Commonwealth's receipts; in 1932-33 it amounted to over £4,500,000. Practically the whole of the imported goods directly affecting the primary industries have been either exempted from primage duty or made subject to the low rate of 4 per cent. It will be seen that the Government, since it assumed office, has gone as far as it can in providing relief from these duties, and that any future alterations must depend upon the state of the Treasury. The bill merely confirms what has already been done, and I ask the Senate to expedite its passage.","Second Reading","CUSTOMS TARIFF (PRIMAGE DUTIES) 1934","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

All honorable senators are familiar with the desperate financial straits in which the Scullin Government found Australia when it assumed office in 1929, and with the circumstances which led to the position becoming steadily worse-circumstances entirely beyond the control of any government at that time. The conditions then prevailing forced that Government to examine every possible means of raising revenue in order to meet the commitments of the nation as they became due. Now that the worst of the depression is, apparently, behind us, some honorable senators supporting the Government appear to forget how serious was the position when the Scullin Government took office, and blame that Government for making these imposts at all. On the other hand, they give credit to the present Government for the removal, or partial removal, of the imposts. I remind honorable senators who may be disposed to think and talk along those lines that every impost placed on the people of Australia by the previous Government had the approval of the Senate, which could have prevented any such legislation from being placed on the statute-book had it so desired. Realizing, however, that, in the then existing circumstances, there was no other course open, the Senate did not reject the proposals of the Scullin Government. In addition to surveying the field with a view to finding additional sources of revenue, the previous Government set about curtailing expenditure, wherever possible. It reduced considerably the disbursements from the public purse to every section of the community which had either a statutory or a moral right to receive moneys from the nation. It sought throughout to make the sacrifice equitable; it demanded sacrifices on the part of the people, only in order to maintain the solvency of the Australian nation. At that time there was a general understanding among all political parties-an understanding voiced by their leaders and prominent members in both chambers-that, as soon as the financial position of the country permitted, the load of taxation would be lightened, and that, in making disbursements from the Treasury, the poorer section of the community would be considered first. I regret that the present Government has not carried out that undertaking. Members of the Opposition have repeatedly had occasion to criticize the action of the Government in reducing taxation imposed upon the comparatively wealthy sections of the community and failing to restore the former payments to pensioners and the lower-paid public servants. Some of the amendments contained in the schedule will, in some small degree, reduce the present burdens of the primary producers, but the relief will not be so substantial as has been alleged, because most of the farmers have had their buying power lowered almost to vanishing point.","Second Reading","CUSTOMS TARIFF (PRIMAGE DUTIES) 1934","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I shall compliment it upon any action it may take to reduce the tariff, for I regard every primage duty as a particularly objectionable form of tariff increase. Australia now has the highest and most oppressive tariff ever ratified by both Houses of Parliament since the inception of federation, and the sooner primage duties are abolished the better it will be for the whole community, and particularly for those engaged in the primary industries. I have received serious complaints about the unjust and inequitable incidence of primage upon many of our industries, and upon many citizens. The higher the customs duty is, the greater is the amount of the primage.

Apart, however, from ordinary customs duty the goods, if regarded as goods imported, require to be entered in accordance with section 68, and, on entry for home consumption, some are at present liable to primage duty.

The Solicitor-General advised that the goods are imported goods, and are therefore required to be entered in accordance with section 68 The gathering of these goods really constitutes an Australian industry, and although at times the goods are gathered outside the territorial waters of the Commonwealth, it is considered that they should be relieved from compliance with the customs formalities which apply to goods brought to the Commonwealth from overseas in the ordinary way of import trade.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL 1932","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Are we to assume that if restrictions are imposed against the importation of certain products of Papua and New Guinea they will apply also to similar products of the Northern Territory? I have at my disposal a good deal of information concerning this matter, but, unfortunately, I missed the opportunity to speak on the motion for the second reading. I hope, therefore, that I am in order in discussing briefly the general policy of the Government with regard to the Pacific possessions of the Commonwealth.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA PREFERENCE) 1934","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I found at all the meetings I addressed during a recent visit to Western Australia, that if an interjector in that State wanted to say anything unpleasant about Queensland, he ejaculated ' sugar'', about which he knew nothing. After all there is something in Senator Johnston's request that the Minister should state the settled policy of the Government regarding the importations of these commodities from Papua and New Guinea, which are under the control of the Commonwealth. It is proposed that a number of commodities produced by colored labour shall be admitted into Australia free of duty, which means that the production of these commodities in Australia will be retarded. Coffee is not being produced in Queensland in commercial quantities, but before I left Queensland a few weeks ago, I saw 38 coffee trees, grown in a backyard in Brisbane, and tended by an aged man under the most primitive conditions, producing coffee beans which could not be surpassed in any country of the world. I saw the raw and the roasted beans, and also consumed coffee made from them. I believe that with adequate assistance from the Government we could produce all the coffee required in Australia. About ten days ago I asked for information regarding the . values of certain commodities, including some of the items mentioned in the schedule, imported into Australia. Other items in the schedule, including kapok and green ginger, could be economically produced in Australia, if the Government encouraged production. One question I asked related to castor oil, and the answer I received was that no figures have been tabulated. We seem to be getting into a muddle. At one time we are restricted by the Ottawa agreement; on the next occasion it is the Colonial ' Empire; and now we have to make a concession to the Mandated Territories, which are ours at the moment, although I do not know for how long.

So far as I am aware, that is the only agreement entered into by Australia with an overseas country that has produced tangible results. We have extended our markets in Canada for our dried and canned fruits, wine and other commodities, and if we interfere with this schedule, which deals with the preference extended to that dominion as a quid pro quo for the preference which Australian products receive on entering Canada, the whole agreement will go by the board. Although the suggested increase of duty might give employment to a few men in cutting logs, it might lead to hundreds of other Australians, now engaged in >the canned and dried fruits and viticultural industries, being thrown out of work. The duty to which the honorable senator has taken exception applies only to unsawn logs, so I assume that all the milling and other work connected with the production of veneers from this timber would be done in Australian mills or factories.

Apparently this gentleman has suddenly developed into a prominent sheep and wool expert, and is to become the custodian of the greatest industry we have in Australia. It is pleasing to know that he is watching the interests of the Australian wool-growers, and in that connexion I shall co-operate with him to the best of my ability. It does not matter what he said concerning the Australian wool industry, because, in effect, he modestly admitted that he knew nothing about it. Such an explanation was entirely unnecessary. But I take strong exception to certain grossly inaccurate references concerning me personally, which reflect upon my honour. As we are all aware, some years ago a Labour government placed an embargo upon the export of stud merino sheep from Australia, and on that occasion I supported its action. I have always done so, because, in the interest of the greatest industry that we have, it is wise that some restriction should be placed upon the export of our incomparable merino sheep to other countries, where they may be used to build up a wool growing industry to the detriment of Australia's wool trade. Even when a Labour government was in power, it was always possible to obtain permits to export other than merino sheep, because it was realized that all British breeds and Corriedales can be obtained in other countries, and that possibly sheep of better quality could be obtained in unlimited quantities in New Zealand. I was pleased to notice that the honorable member for West Sydney is taking a very keen interest in the welfare of the Australian wool-growers, and the wool industry generally, He rightly said-","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I suggest that the dogs were barking up the wrong tree. Perhaps he meant the bleating of the goats. Ever since I have been associated with the wool industry, I have supported an embargo on the export of stud merino rams from Australia, and year after year, at the New .South Wales Sheep-breeders' Association, of the council of which I have the honour to be a member. I have opposed resolutions asking the Government to remove the embargo. In doing so, I have made myself extremely unpopular with certain ram breeders, and have lost a lot of friends, and, incidentally, some business. I followed the course I did, because I have realized that because of its prepon-derating importance to Australia, the wo.q1 industry is of greater moment than the personal interest of a-few ram-breeders. There are 90,000 families growing wool in Australia, and their success has been due largely to the efforts of that great pioneer Macarthur, who laid the foundation of the Australian wool industry. Largely as a result of his efforts, we have been able to breed the finest sheep produced in any part of the world. The importance of the wool industry to Australia will be found in the fact that with only 16 per cent, of the world's sheep, we have been producing 32 per cent, of the total value of the world's wool, showing that per sheep Australia can annually produce wool of twice the value of that produced in any other part of the world. Merino sheep are the backbone of the great Australian wool industry. Owing to the preponderance of merinos, Australia is now growing nearly 60 per cent, of the merino wool produced in the world. When I first entered the wool-growing industry, South Africa was producing only 20,000 bales of inferior wool; but after the South African woolproducers had been given a free ha-nd in the purchase of our best sheep, the production in that country increased to nearly 1,000,000 bales of good merino wool per annum. A few years ago, Russia, which breeds only a. poor type, claimed to have 130,000,000 sheep. Large shipments of merinos were about to bc sent to Russia, and the Russian people could have produced wool of better quality if big shipments of Australian stud merinos had been permitted. For that and for other reasons, I have always supported a majority of the graziers who opposed the lifting of the embargo. The honorable member for West Sydney objected to Australian sheep being exported to New Zealand; but as New Zealand is not a country suitable for merinos, few of that breed have been sent from Australia to the dominion. He also charged the Government with allowing Romney Marsh sheep to be sent to New Zealand, but those and other British breeds are always available from other sources. He attacked the export of Corriedales to New Zealand and to other countries, but New Zealand is the home of the Corriedale. Buyers in all parts of the world can purchase Romney Marsh, other British breeds of sheep, and Corriedales, in that dominion. I have had the good luck to sell a few Corriedale sheep to New Zealand, but I had to buy many more sheep from the dominion than I have sent there, and that is the general trend of trade. Australia buys much more extensively from New Zealand than New Zealand buys from it. We have always been able to get permission, even under Labour governments, to export stud sheep from Australia to New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, India_ and other countries, although I think' it would be very difficult to get a permit to ship sheep to Russia. Nothing underhand has been done by either the Government or its supporters, and the insinuation that there is something to hide-that I have shipped Corriedale sheep to other parts of the world and must have used undue influence to get the necessary permission-is ridiculous. I am proud of the fact that some buyers think that my rams are worth purchasing. This year I had the honour to sell a Corriedale ram to a noted breeder in Fyfeshire, Scotland. Does Mr. Beasley, or any one else, suggest that there should be an embargo on that animal? Was the sale of it bad for Australia? I have also sold sheep to the United States of America, Canada, and New Zealand, but I. have imported probably more sheep than I have sold.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[1]/para[2]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

But the maximum number of sheep allowed to any farmer is five, and the total number in the country is only 30,000. So, I do not think that it can be seriously contended that by the shipment of a few Corriedale sheep to eat mulberry leaves in Japan, the Australian wool-growing industry is being jeopardized. Apart from that, honorable senators should remember that Japan is our second biggest customer for wool, its purchases amounting to between £10,000,000 to £12,000,000 per annum. Even when the export of my few Corriedales is set against the fact that Japan buys from us 500,000 or 600,000 bales of wool per annum, and hopes to buy a million per annum, the balance of trade is still very much in our favour.

Certainly they have a few million very rough sheep, but at seasons of the year the ground is frozen to a depth of three to four feet; the soil is saline, and the herbage is such that the pastoral industry there can never be developed to be a serious competitor with that in Australia. If I thought that I would he doing any harm by selling to Japan a few sheep that might ultimately reach Manchuria or Manchukuo, I would be quite agreeable to refuse such business. I speak not as a big squatter, such as Mr. Beasley described me, but as a man engaged-in a relatively small way. New Zealand has good Corriedales and a great number of them, and if the Government of the dominion, following the example of Australia's embargo on the exportation of merinos, saw fit to prohibit the exportation of Corriedales, we might possibly with advantage do 'the same. But the Commonwealth Government is alive to anything that might be detrimental to our wool industry, and it is very difficult for anyone to get a permit for the export of stud sheep. It is negotiating with the New Zealand Government at the present time, and if New Zealand were to put an embargo on the exportation of Cor.riedales, I would personally favour a similar embargo in Australia, simply to prove that I am sincere in my desire to place the wool industry before personal gain, though I do not think that such a step would be efficacious, as there are some millions of these sheep in South America, although the breed in that country is not so good as in New Zealand and the Commonwealth. The Japanese Government has bought no stud Corriedale sheep this year, but only a few flock sheep that we were fortunate to dispose of. The honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) seems to be better acquainted with the pastoral industry than is Mr. Beasley, because he says that every Australian enjoys some benefit from the prosperity of the industry, and that everything that can be done to protect it should be done. With those sentiments I agree. It is gratifying to know that such authorities as Mr. Beasley and Mr. Forde are joining with others to see that Australia's great industry is protected. I thought that West Sydney was famous for producing goats rather than sheep. Although I recognize that the people of that constituency are political lambs, I did not expect their representative to take such an active part in protecting the wool industry, as he did when he made a speech for which he would have been applauded had he not made scurrilous insinuations against the Government, Mr. Nock, M.H.R., and myself.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

This is a matter of long standing, and perhaps the Minister is fully cognizant of the circumstances. I have taken clown a statement from Captain Conway, and it seems to me that he has a genuine grievance for which, however, he can get no redress. Captain Conway's claim may be summarized in this way: For many years he rendered efficient and meritorious service, for which, on his retirement, he received the thanks of the Minister of the day. After his retirement, however, he was maligned by published statements, and, ultimately, succeeded in forcing an investigation, which was conducted by the Chief of the General Staff, General J. H. Bruche, who courageously exposed the misrepresentation. The following facts were disclosed by the investigation:-(a) That Conway efficiently, diligently and meritoriously performed his duty. (6) That the department had deprived him of the credit of his service. (c) That he had been publicly represented as having failed in the performance of his duty. These serious facts were established by General Bruche, and in due course Captain Conway submitted his claim for compensation for injurious misrepresentation. The department now adopts the attitude that the findings of General Bruche were not in accordance with the facts; that the matter circulated concerning Captain Conway was true; and that General Bruche arrived at his decision by arrangement with Captain Conway and others. The Government cannot allow the matter to remain in this most unsatisfactory state. The integrity and ability of General Bruche have been impugned, and it is imperative that the whole of the matters mentioned should be investigated promptly and thoroughly by an independent . tribunal. Either Captain Conway was seriously misrepresented and injured, or General Bruche played the part of a political puppet. The issue is simple and plain; justice must be done, even though the department has to pay for its persecution of a capable and trustworthy officer, who rendered meritorious service to King and Country in every position in which he served. I should like the Minister to lay on the table of the Senate the report by General Bruche. Any man who renders faithful service to his employer is entitled to a reference. It is not right that an employer, having given a man a satisfactory reference, should afterwards say that what he said in the reference was not true, and that the employee is not what he represented him to to be. If Captain Conway did not deserve the thanks of the department, he should not have been thanked. This matter is sufficiently serious to justify a thorough investigation by an independent tribunal. I do not know what baa been done. When Captain Conway presented his case to me I felt that an injustice had been done to him, and consequently I have brought the matter before the Senate.","Sier, Secretary","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It may be that the Minister is endowed with a sense of humour, and consequently has given me the reply mentioned; but, a3 a representative of the people, I am not satisfied with it. I claim that I am entitled to a proper answer to my question, lu the heat of debate the Minister said that I had the distinction of writing more letters to him, as Minister for Defence, than any other honorable senator. One would imagine that I had sent to the Minister thousands of letters asking for jobs in the Australian Navy; yet, on his own admission, he received from me in two and a half years only six applications for entry or re-entry into the Navy, and two applications for positions at Garden Island. When I asked how many such applications were successful, I got the usual 'wipe-off.' I could forgive the Minister for a loss of self-control during a heated debate; but I think that, on reflection, he will admit that honorable senators are only doing their duty when they send letters to Ministers on behalf of their constituents. I hope, therefore, that, even yet, the Minister will reply satisfactorily to my question. If members of this Parliament are to ,be impeached because they write letters to Ministers, I can only say that' such condemnation savours of political bodyline bowling. The Mansard record will show the manner in which the representatives of the people are sometimes treated by Ministers when relations are strained in this chamber. Senator Guthrie has seen fit to criticize the leader of the political group to which I belong-the honorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley). Would the honorable senator deny to Mr. Beasley the right to criticize any happening calculated to injure Australia? Senator Guthrie knows that the honorable member for West Sydney is a son of the late Tom Beasley, a well-known farmer of Werribee, and that in his early life he was engaged in that form of primary production for which the Bacchus Marsh and Werribee district is famed. A few days ago the honorable member for West Sydney moved the adjournment of the House of Representatives to draw attention to the danger to Australia of the export of Corriedale sheep to Japan.","Sier, Secretary","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

No one will deny that Japan is making a determined effort to build up its flocks, and there is no doubt that it is drawing largely on Australian studs. When I was a boy, it was generally believed that Japan, which was then giving its attention to the development of secondary industries, would never become a great industrial nation. As we now know, that country has made such astonishing progress industrially that its competition in world markets is giving a headache to the leading statesmen in all countries. It has become Britain's most formidable competitor in dominion markets, and particularly in India, which is one of the lowest wage countries in the world. If Japan is so formidable, industrially, is it not likely that as a woolproducing country it will cause considerable trouble to Australia? The stud rams and ewes which it has purchased from Australia for a few pounds may prove to be the nucleus of numerous flocks, the product of which may one day be in competition with Australian-grown wool in the markets of the world.","Sier, Secretary","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

If Mr. Beasley inadvertently did Senator Guthrie an injustice, he would, I am sure, be the first to apologize. I think Senator Guthrie has, by his own words, gone far to cancel any claim that he might have had upon Mr. Beasley to rectify any harm which his remarks may have done to the honorable senator. It was certainly in the worst of taste for the honorable gentleman referring to Mr. Beasley, to offer some weak witticism about 'goats' in West Sydney. The avowed intention of Japan is to build up its flocks of high-class, wool-bearing sheep in the territory of Manchukuo, which is now under its control. It may be true, as Senator Guthrie has said, that Manchukuo is noteminently adapted for the production of high-class wool. The same may be said of many parts of Australia. It is, however, possible that, following scientific research, the quality of wool produced in Manchukuo may be improved to such an extent that, in time, it will be a strong competitor of Australian wools in the world's markets.It is generally known that ifa particular class of country is not suitable for the production of highclass wool, it is necessary, from time to time, to import rams from the country where the best kind of wool is produced, in order to prevent the flocks from deteriorating. It is, therefore, clear that if we permit trading by Australian stud masters with Manchukuo through Japan, for the purpose of building up the flocks in that country, those concerned will make every effort to continue the business. The same remarks apply to the efforts made by Russia to improve its flocks. I cannot imagine that any very large area of the Soviet Republic, with, the exception of the extreme southern portion, is suitable for the production of fine merino wool; hut if suitable strains can he obtained from any other country, the Russian growers may be able to improve the quality of their flocks. If we permit inroads to be made into our wool industry, vested interests in other countries will see that there is a continuance of exports from Australia. I read in a Sydney newspaper a few days ago that a branch of the wool-growing industry passed a resolution requesting the Government to enforce the embargo on the export of Corriedales. Senator Guthrie said that New Zealand was a country in which merino sheep were not prominent. During recent years, large tracts of country formerly used for grazing merino sheep have been subdivided, and are now devoted to the depasturing of Lincoln, Leicester and Romney Marsh sheep. Although large numbers of long woolled sheep are now being bred in New Zealand, the merino is so adaptable that it can be successfully carried on millions of acres in New Zealand, even on country 5,000 feet above the sea level. I know of what I am speaking, because I have worked and shorn sheep in that type of country. Senator Guthrie may consider that he knows a great deal about sheep-breeding, but he is wrong in saying that merino sheep will not thrive in New Zealand. They do well on the plains, and also on country 5,000 feet above sea levety even during the severest winter. 1 have known of merino sheep to put their heads together during a snow storm, and, by the warmth of their breath, to melt the snow sufficiently to enable them to live until the danger had passed.","Sier, Secretary","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The writer of the letter said that he was a sheep-breeder, and that he bad looked at the head, but was quite sure that it was not the merino upon which our great sheep industry had been founded. He said that it might be a Dorset, but whatever its breed, it was better dead.
