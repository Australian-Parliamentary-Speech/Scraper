Last week the decision rested with the Federal Government, but, as there was not a full Cabinet meeting to consider the question, the subject was postponed until this week.

Senator Millen, for instance, referred to the gentleman who has been appointed to the position of Government Geologist in the Northern Territory.

The Government are introducing in the Northern Territory what, so far as Australia is concerned, is a new land policy based upon the important principle of leasehold. It is a trite saying that administration is a most important factor of government. No one will doubt that the principle of leasehold could be defeated by unsympathetic administration. It might be made to appear ridiculous and absurd, and might, apparently, be proved a complete failure, if left to the administration of a man who does not believe in the principle. As a member of the Government, therefore, I would have no hesitation whatever in insisting that the administration of so important a principle should be placed in the hands of a man. who believed in it. Mr. Neilsen is admitted' even by his opponents to be familiar with the land legislation of New South Wales. He has taken a prominent part in the administration of the land laws of that State. He is a thorough believer in the leasehold! principle, and gave up a position in the State Government because of his adherence to it. When we are afforded an opportunity to appoint a man having all the necessary qualifications for a post, and who is at the same time a believer in the principle he is to be called upon to administer, I shall be prepared to justify the appointment of such a man on any platform in Australia.

I need not refer to other appointments which have been challenged, as what I have already said is applicable to them. Senator Millen has offered no objection based upon the qualifications of the men appointed, but has simply condemned the appointments because those appointed happened to be known as supporters of the Government in power.

There was no provision for training in camp at all. Both the provision moved by Senator de Largie, and that moved by myself and supported by my colleagues, are now part of the Defence Act, and they constitute a vital and important difference between the two laws. Moreover, they were confirmed as being absolutely necessary by Lord Kitchener when he reviewed the position. The vital points of difference between the law now in force sud the Act passed at the instance of Mr. Cook are, to summarize them, these : The present law makes it obligatory that an officer, on obtaining his commission in the Citizen Forces, shall bind himself for twelve years, failing which he will not be regarded as having fulfilled his military service, and will go back into the ranks. Tha't important provision insures a supply of officers. . Under' Mr. Cook 's Act we should never have been able to find a sufficient supply of officers for the Forces. The present law gives us the advantage that when an officer obtains a commission he knows that he has to serve for twelve years, and it also gives us an opportunity to retain the services of officers for a longer period. The present Act definitely lays down what the exemptions from service in time of war shall be. Mr. Cook 's Act merely declared that the Governor-General could prescribe what the exemptions should be. It left it open for the Government of the day to exempt certain people who professed to be conscientiously opposed to service. Again, the present Act extends the limit of age for service in the Citizen Forces. Under Mr. Cook 's Act the age was from eighteen to twenty, whereas the present Act provides for an extension from twenty to twenty-five.

They found that if they had simply accepted what their predecessors had done, the power plant, which has been manufactured in Australia, would have had to be imported from abroad. That was one thing which the Fisher Government provided for. They found, also, that no provision - absolutely none - had been made to secure any information as to what the various tenderers were binding themselves to supply; and it was only after a long series of negotiations, which are embodied in a parliamentary paper, that the Fisher Government were able to ascertain on an actuarial basis what the tenders meant, and what their relative value was. No specifications had been issued. Tenderers were simply invited to supply their own specifications. After negotiations extending over many months, the work was done under the régime of the Fisher Government.

Even if we had started a yard of our own, or had invited firms to start a yard for the building of these ships-, the delay that has occurred could not have been prevented. We are anxious, however, and are doing all we can, to induce the New South Wales Government to proceed with that work. They have done a very large amount of preliminary work, and we are anxious that all the ships shall be provided at the earliest possible moment. It is worth some sacrifice of time to demonstrate the fact that ships of this kind can be built in Australia, and to obtain the knowledge and experience that will enable us to build in Australia in the future. Let us, however, judge the honorable senator by the performances of his Government when in office. They then had an opportunity of demonstrating what they could do. Here are the facts in regard to the construction of the Warrego . The offer of the New South Wales Government to the Fisher Government to construct the Warrego was made on the 26th April, 1909. While the inquiries were being made the Fisher Government went out of office - on 2nd June. We sent to the New South Wales Government, however, to ask for information concerning the doing of the work, and those inquiries were progressing when we left office. The Fusion Government came into office in June, 1909. During their term of office the Fusion Government received no less than three reminders from the Wade Government asking them to hurry up their decision.

Seeing that the total revenue of the Commonwealth at the present time is about £20,000,000, it will be admitted that the Commonwealth revenue has not increased in a greater proportion than have the revenues of the States. The Commonwealth revenue at the commencement of Federation was, I think, between £8,000,000 and £9,000,000, and as it is now about £20,000,000, it has not increased during the same term at a greater ratio than have the revenues of the States.

The Opposition quote the increase in Commonwealth revenue as though it were a sin to be laid to the charge of the present Government. Seeing that at least a similar increase has taken place in the revenues of the States, if it is a sin against the present Commonwealth Government, it is equally a sin against the State Governments whom honorable senators opposite support. I should like to know the object in continually quoting the enormous increase of revenue as something which the present Government should be ashamed of or are called upon to explain. It is clear from the figures which can be supplied that it is not an abnormal increase due to Commonwealth taxation, but is due to the increase of population, the greater capacity for production of the people, and the general increase of prosperity in the country. Senator Millen seemed sceptical about the effect of the progressive land tax. He claimed that it had failed to bring land into use.

We have been informed in the Governor-General's Speech that we were called together to consider matters of great importance to the country, and the thirty-ninth paragraph of the Speech expresses the hope that, under Divine guidance, our deliberations will be for the welfare of the people. I wish to say that, in connexion with the principal administrative act of the Government, there does not appear to have been very much of Divine guidance, but, on the contrary, evil spirits appear to have taken complete possession of their councils. I allude to the Brisbane strike. I am aware that the details of the Brisbane strike have been presented and debated inside and outside of Parliament until the subject may be said to have become threadbare. However, I believe that very grave issues arose out of the strike, and the attitude the Government took towards it, and I make bold to say that those issues cannot be decided finally by this Parliament. They must go for consideration and final decision to the electors of Australia. Tt is to this aspect of the question I intend to address myself. Before we can thoroughly understand what those issues are, it is necessary to refer to two or three instances connected with the strike. I think that the incidents which I shall mention will be admitted by honorable senators opposite to be indisputable facts. The first is that the city of Brisbane was for at least a week in possession of, or under the tyrannism of, a strike committee, which - if I may be permitted to borrow a phrase from a Labour Minister in New South Wales - may aptly be described as ' a gang of industrial bushrangers.

But I think it will be difficult for the Government to justify their attitude before the electors of this country. In order that honorable . senators may understand how serious was the attack which was made upon railway communication with Brisbane, I intend to quote from certain newspaper reports. I find that a Mr. T. E. Brown, who was the leader of that portion of the strikers who attacked the Railway Workshops at Ipswich, informed a meeting which he addressed at the Central Gardens there, that he had called out the shunters in the local railway yards, and that they had responded to a man. He said that out of 1,400 men who had struck only thirty-two had reported themselves back on the railway works, and they would have to come out. He added that their names would be placed upon the black-list so that everybody in Ipswich would know who were the men who had the courage to remain loyal to the service of the State. At that time the situation was so critical that the Railway Commissioner, Mr. Evans, convened a meeting of various representatives of the railway service in order that measures might be taken to put an end to the interruption of the city's railway communication.

This means assembling practically roo or more engines - emptying the boilers and tenders, white-leading the motions and laying them up, and this in its turn means a large quantity of machinery being laid up also. Now,  I am informed that there have been men at work to-day, but that puts me into a much more serious position that I ever dreamed of, as a gentleman named Brown is reported to have said on the 4th instant, that he had called out the shunters in the local railway yards, and they had come out to a man, also that the names of the men who had reported themselves for duty had been secured, and would be available. ' The time is coming,' he is reported to have said, ' when we shall go back to those shops. When I go back there these thirty-two men will have to go.' Continuing, Mr. Evans said 'Those men have now increased to 204. I don't know where he expects you to go to. I expect you to remain where you are, and, if it is necessary for me to do so, I will sleep on the premises, and will see that no 'man interferes with my business. I am proud that your names are still on the railway books, and I hope Mr. Brown will not wipe them off. . (Laughter.) Mr. Brown was also reported to have declared they were all going back to the shops, and going back to a man - going back in a body or not at all. Some people, said Mr. Brown , told them that they would lose their privileges, but that was a matter which concerned them all, and to which they would not submit. ' What I hope is this : The very fact of your action in coming back will induce others who have been misinformed - I do not say intimidated - to come back before 7.30 on Thursday morning. i have asked them, and I now ask them through you to come back to work. If they do, everything will go as it went before. (Applause.) From Mr. Brown 's remarks, I take it he is at the head of a great force, a great army, or he wishes me and you to think he is, and just at this point is where you and I come in. He says he is going to put you out, but when he and his great army does that I go out also, and if I go out without defending, or attempting to defend, the lives and property committed to my charge, I am sure all right-minded people will say I was not worthy of being placed at the head of the great railway service, and I wish with all peaceful earnestness to inform Mr. Brown that I wish to be the head of a small force at the Ipswich workshops when he comes along, and the defence will be grounded on the fact that we are on the defence, through no quarrel of our own bringing about, and, therefore, we may hope to strengthen our forces through those who are ever ready to help those who have been hit below the belt, and that we have been hit in the most cowardly manner is apparent.'

On the day following the speech a good number of the men returned to the Ipswich workshops. Mr. Evans then addressed them. I will give a brief extract from his speech both to the men who had remained loyal and to those who had been wavering. I quote this, because I think it will appeal, not only to the Senate, but to whomsoever may read it. It was listened to attentively by the people to whom it was delivered, and its appeal has equal force to others.  Let me tell you, with all the earnestness in my power, that it is your duty to your God, and to those depending on you, to think, think, think; to use your brains as well as your hands in your daily avocations, and therefore I do ask of you to be careful in the future, and do. not be led away by those who induce you to strike. If at any time you feel inclined to be dissatisfied, send for me, and I will go to you, if possible; in fact, it is my duty, as it is your duty to come to me, and, my dear friends, is there not room for thought - much thought - when we consider that those whom you and I sent into the highest tribunal in the land to make the laws, should be the first to incite us - you and I, mind - to break those laws? Does the law of God not say that we shall 'cling .to our wives,' and to honour our parents, but are we doing it when we tear the roof from above them, and keep food from their mouths, and clothing from their bodies, by stopping the earnings that are justly due to them? That speech, to my mind, was not only creditable to the courage and capacity of the Railways Commissioner, but, considering the occasion on which it was made, and the circumstances to which it was applicable, is. worthy of being pondered by the whole of Australia.

The Registrar told me that there was an industrial agreement, and gave me the date on which it was signed and executed. He gave me the names of the parties who signed it. Therefore, it seems to me to be idle to try to make out that these waterside workers were not working under an industrial agreement, properly signed and executed, and now in the possession of the Registrar of the Federal Arbitration Court. History shows that that agreement was broken. I believe that, at the present time, the Court is considering what, if any, shall be the punishment inflicted upon those men for having broken the agreement.

I am even prepared to believe that the document to which I am referring will be denied. One of the most remarkable features of recent political discussions has been that, when in connexion with the Brisbane strike we have given irrefragable proof of facts, they have been denied so calmly in official organs of the Labour party and elsewhere, that it makes one realize something of the force of the Scripture incident about Ananias and Sapphira. It is somewhat remarkable, also, that three of the gentlemen whom I have mentioned as signing the agreement are members of this Parliament. I am not aware that history records that, during the strike, they went up to Brisbane to recall the men to a sense of their duty. These three gentlemen were, in fact, conspicuous by their silence, notwithstanding that their names are attached to the document which was intended to insure industrial peace.

If the honorable senator chooses to approve of one party, and to blame or criticise the other party, he is welcome to do so. I am merely mentioning facts which are not disputed. The general strike arose out of a desire on the part of the men to wear their union badge, and the refusal of the tramway manager to allow them to do so. That, and several other matters, were contained in a plaint which was referred to the decision of the Arbitration Court. The reference of the whole of the matters, including the wearing of the badge, was made in October, 191 1, and they were then brought within the cognisance of the Arbitration Court. It is not, I think, too harsh to say that it is further indisputable that the men wantonly brushed aside the jurisdiction of the Court to which they had themselves appealed.

Suppose the employes say to the Government, ' We have suffered from long continued grievances and you have refused to redress them. We shall not go to your Court. We shall not await its jurisdiction. We shall go out on strike.' Could the Government, with justice, and without the most dangerous discrimination, plead that in such circumstances the employés would be justified in going out on strike?

The more we analyze the position of honorable senators opposite, in connexion with conciliation and arbitration, the more abundantly it becomes evident that they do not care one straw for the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as regards its application to private or Government employés, if, at any time, the employes say that, because of unredressed grievances, they propose to go out on strike. That is the position which honorable senators opposite are steadily maintaining, and which Senator Givens is endeavouring to emphasize. If my honorable friends choose to treat the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in that way they must abide by the consequences. If the postal employés in the circumstances which I have mentioned decided to strike, and called out the members of forty-three unions, or of 430 unions, for the purpose of paralyzing telegraphic communication throughout Australia, and of setting up a strike committee over the community, would the Government dare to justify their action? And if they could not justify it, how can they justify the action of employés who decide to strike, notwithstanding that there is in existence an Arbitration Court to which they may appeal for redress of their grievances. Practically what the Prime Minister and his colleagues did over and over again was to say to the Brisbane tramway employes, ' Well done thou good and faithful servants.' In my judgment, when they supported the strikers they sowed the seeds of disloyalty and revolt within the Commonwealth Public Service itself. Now, if there is one place in which it is important that loyalty should be preserved it is in our Public Service, and any Government which tends to sap that loyalty is guilty of a grievous wrong.

I believe that gold is more effective, both as a metal and as coin, when it is held in the banks than when it is in people's pockets. Australians use more gold currency than any people on earth. Senator Millen mentions to me that they also use cheques very freely; but the important fact is that they carry gold in their pockets as coinage more freely than do people elsewhere. I wish all success to a paper currency well based and well managed. I am certainly no enemy to it. I wish that our people used paper as freely as do the people of France and the United States. In France, if you want gold, you have to buy it. When you buy it with paper, you have to pay a premium for it.

What we have endeavoured to do is to see that any paper currency we have shall be based upon a sufficient working margin of gold. What reason can be given as to why the paper currency does not circulate as freely as we should like? I think it is to be found in the vapourings often and freely indulged in by honorable senators opposite, and even by the Prime Minister himself. The Prime Minister has described the idea that a paper currency displaces gold as ' a fad,' and he comforts himself with the remark that we are a gold producing nation. Now there is such a thing as Gresham's law of money, and the Prime Minister wantonly flies in the face of that law when he enunciates such an idea. Gresham's law is, in substance, that whenever you adopt a baser currency the less base currency tends to disappear. If you try to make silver the currency of a country by rushing it into circulation, gold tends to disappear. If you try to make paper do the work which gold and silver have been in the habit of doing, silver and gold tend to disappear. That law holds good everywhere, and is accepted by competent financial authorities all over the world. The Prime Minister, however, has not the slightest hesitation in flying in the face of it. I think the Prime Minister also said, as to university professors; that no doubt they could speak with authority on matters relating to science and history, and could teach the workers something as to them; but that there was one thing as to which the workers could teach the university professors, and that was as to the laws of economics. If the Prime Minister's disregard of Gresham's law is an illustration of his capacity to teach political economy to university professors, I take the liberty to doubt whether he will ever be able to make people regard him seriously. I also doubt whether, if he disregards Gresham's law in this fashion, he will be able to promote an effective note circulation in this country. There is nothing as to which people are so susceptible, and so liable to take panic - often unreasonably and unduly - as their currency. We all like to know that there is gold at the back of our paper which is forthcoming if we want it. When a remark like that which I have quoted from the Prime Minister is circulated, the common sense of the people leads them to distrust a note issue which is under the control of a man entertaining such ideas. I have also read that many honorable senators opposite have proclaimed that when they came into power every housewife would have £5 or so every week. Indeed, I think it was the Prime Minister himself who said so.

I may be wrong; we are all liable to make errors. But I think it was the Prime Minister who made such a statement. When the Commonwealth Bank was inaugurated it was announced by the Minister of Home Affairs - who may be called the creator of the bank to some extent - that after the bank was instituted farmers and others would be able to go to it and get advances without being any longer sweated and ground down as they were by ordinary private banks. He claimed that commercial development through the Commonwealth Bank would be assisted by large advances at a cheap rate. If there is any honorable senator opposite who entertains the delusion that any Government can lend out money in advances of that kind at cheaper rates than can ordinary banks, I can only say that they have not read with sufficient care the history of such transactions. In nearly every case where a Government has stood behind such transactions either as mortgagor or - as has sometimes been the case when a Government has been compelled to take the position - as mortgagee, there has been a continuous record of disaster. When people are led to believe by inference that Commonwealth paper is to be flung broadcast in that way no wonder they are chary of holding Commonwealth notes to too large an extent. I think that is one of the real reasons why our paper is not going. I believe that the other side, and, with all respect to him, the Prime Minister himself, are doing more to damn our own currency than all the Opposition can say or do.

I concur absolutely with the criticism of my leader,- that its composition was so partisan that the desire seemed to be to appoint a Commission which would find a verdict in spite of the evidence. I desire now to refer to another administrative blunder, and a grave one, indeed. It is not like the other blunders to which I have already referred, partaking much of the nature of a crime, but it is a grievous blunder, and that is the abandonment of the Vancouver mail service. The Senate is aware that this was a service in which the people of New South Wales and Queensland, especially the latter State, and probably, if you like, the whole of the electors in the eastern States, were very much interested. It is almost a matter of history that, time and again, when negotiations for the continuance of the service were proceeding, we were assured that certainly the interests of Queensland would be conserved, that the people of that State could rely upon the Government seeing that full justice was done to them; but we have been grievously disappointed. Some time last year. I happened to receive certain information which was of a more or less confidential nature, and authoritative, and, apart from that, it had, in the long run, the superior merit of being absolutely correct. It was to the effect that the Canadian Government were tired of the prolonged negotiations which they were forced into with the Commonwealth Government, and had practically sent an ultimatum to the latter body to make up their mind and say whether or not they would give a subsidy for the Vancouver service. I believe that the amount was stated. The Government knew, as some of us knew privately, that it was a matter of £60,000 odd. Negotiations were prolonged. We were called in by Mr. Thomas, the Postmaster-General, time and again. On one occasion, perhaps on more than one occasion, he gave us information. Some of it was confidential, and, of course, the confidence was respected. The sum and substance of these conferences was that we were always told that we could rest assured that Queensland was not going to be left out, and that her interests would be attended to. I ventured to throw out, and I believe it is recorded in Hansard, a sort of hint that we were being deceived; and once, at a deputation, when the matter under discussion was whether this service should be continued on the deep blue sea or should go to the care of His Satanic Majesty, I said that it was going to the care of His Satanic Majesty. It has gone there.  ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/continue[73]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

' At any rate, it is not on the deep blue sea, as it ought to have been. I think we have sufficient reason to say that the late Postmaster-General, and, to some extent, the Prime Minister, did not deal fairly and openly with the people of Queensland. The share which the Commonwealth was asked to contribute to the service was known to the Government, and it was only a question of terms. I believe the amount at issue was £60,000 odd. The Government of the day played with us - I use the word advisedly - and left us with the belief that almost anything would happen but the abandonment of this service. Yet it has disappeared. I should like to have an explanation from the Government as to why, in the face of repeated professions made both inside and outside Parliament, that the interests of Queensland and New South Wales would be safeguarded, this service has disappeared? If it was only a matter of finding £60,000, may. I mention that the Government have a surplus of over £2,000,000. They professed to be earnestly desirous of developing our trade in the Pacific; and, notwithstanding that we had a service to Vancouver, they said, in effect, that, for the sake of £60,000, that service had to be abandoned. I take this opportunity of pointing out what has been pointed out to us by far more competent authorities - that the trade of the Pacific ought to be ours, and that we ought to be a dominant, or, at any rate, a prominent factor in the trade, and that the trade is worth subsidizing to some extent. The Queensland Government, and, subsequently, the New South Wales Government, for years paid a very large amount as compared with the direct return, and paid it when they could barely spare it, in the hope of future developments taking place. We had a right to expect that the Government, which at the time the renewal of the Vancouver service was asked tor had an overflowing Treasury, would have made good their word to the people ot Queensland. The subsidy which is given by Germany, France, and, I believe, by Holland, for the trade of the Pacific and the South Seas is very much greater. I believe that the Governments of those countries give, on the average, 6s. or 7s. per ton more than the British Government give for subsidies to shipping, and they also give a great deal more than the Commonwealth Government or any Government in Australia have ever given by way of subsidies to steam-ships to develop the trade of the Pacific. Again, the opening of the Panama Canal will revolutionize a good many of our trade communications, lt is of paramount importance to the Commonwealth that we should make a bid, in order to get the trade of the Pacific. Should China awake and subsidize steam-ships as Japan is doing, and the trade of the Pacific, or a large proportion of it get into their hands, it will be difficult for us to retrieve our position. Every day that we are out of the Pacific, especially towards Vancouver and the Panama, will make it more difficult to get the trade back and hold it in the face of increasing competition. It is of great industrial importance that we should have communication with Canada and the United States, and, through the Panama canal, with the eastern coast. Yet the Commonwealth Government, with millions of money to spare, allowed the Vancouver service to disappear, giving us no indication as to whether they would make any attempt to originate such a service or give to Queensland and New South Wales, and to the eastern States generally, the equivalent of the service which they had formerly enjoyed. This action on the part of the Government is a blunder. It is an injustice, especially to Queensland. It is not at all consistent with their oft- repeated professions to the people of Queensland. To say that this service, continued by the same route, would not ultimately pay its way is to furnish evidence of a failure to realize the possibilities of future trade in the PaCcific. Furthermore, we are always preaching reciprocity of trade with New Zealand and Canada, and, possibly, with the United States. Are these merely pious professions? What is the good of the Government talking about a desire to develop trade between countries by fiscal preferences, and then, in the next breath, so to speak, blowing off the only service we had between two great Dominions in the Empire? One thing is entirely inconsistent with the other. I have so often had occasion to use the word ' pharisaical ' that probably it will bore the Senate if I use it again; but I will put it as absolutely inconsistent with that pious profession of a desire to realize the importance of preferential trade and the development of the trade of the Pacific. I feel quite confident that the Commonwealth Government can now infinitely better afford to give £60,000 for the establishment of a new and important steam service between Australia and Vancouver than Queensland and New South Wales could offer to find the £23,000 or £25,000 per annum which they paid from 1893 up to 1905.

If we do not secure it shortly we shall not be likely to get it at all.

I should like to have been able to see the face of the author of the Speech when that paragraph was being written. It is beyond dispute that land is no cheaper to-day in Australia than it was before the imposition of the land tax. On the contrary, everywhere we go we find evidence of a rise in the value of lands whether they are bought privately or through some State agency. Setting aside the question of whether it has had the effect of breaking up large estates, or of promoting settlement - and I do not believe that it has had any material effect in either direction - the fact is that two-thirds of the land tax is being paid by the workers of Australia. They now know what it is worth to them. They have learned that they were deceived. The artisans of our cities have had the Federal land tax passed on to their backs. There are a hundred workers for every single wealthy landowner who are to-day bearing the burden of this tax.

I make these allusions to the Federal land tax for the purpose of drawing attention to what might be called a general law of finance, which seems never' to have been heard of by the other side, or, if heard of, has been entirely disregarded by them. Every attempt made to levy taxation upon a special class in a community must fail, because, in spite of all legislative provisions, taxation is more or less evenly distributed over the whole community. Just as water will find its own level, so every kind of tax - income tax, graduated or otherwise; land tax, graduated or otherwise; and kindred taxes - seems, by the operation of an economic law, to become evenly distributed. One of the great reasons which induced the workers,, and the farmers also, I admit, to support the Federal land tax, was that they were invited to believe that it would fall as a special tax upon a certain class in the community. Deluded by their false leaders, and their false economics, they gave an overwhelming support to the proposal on that ground. It is now evident that at least the farmers -throughout Australia have realized, although, perhaps, they could not express it as I have done, the working of the economic law to which I have referred.

They have found out that it is a dangerous thing to tinker with taxation 'schemes in the belief that certain taxes will be borne only by a special class. I conclude with the hope with which the Governor- General's Speech concluded, namely, that our deliberations will be conducive to the welfare of -the country. I believe that this criticism, and criticism of a similar character which has been directed against the Government, will be of benefit to the country. The misfortunes we have suffered, especially in the industrial arena, show what must follow attempts at class legislation. The less we have of the practice of setting class against class the better it will be for the welfare of the community. I make these remarks with special reference to the Government because they have just emerged from one of the most unfortunate, and, as regards the Strike Committee, one of the most discreditable exhibitions of class hatred in the arena of industry that we ever had in Australia. I regret that instead of acting as arbitrators in the matter, and as instruments of conciliation and pacification, the Government adopted the role of partisans, and intensified the class strife which it was their duty, as it is the duty of every member of this Parliament, to endeavour to lessen in every way.

S. K. Miller, chief metropolitan inspector in Sydney of the Bank of New South Wales. In itself, the appointment is an excellent one, for Mr. Miller will beyond doubt carry into the service he has consented to enter, the conscientiousness, the devotion to duty, and the capacity for organization that he has displayed throughout his banking career. The appointment is, moreover, a guarantee that within the scope of the powers conferred upon the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, the methods and practices adopted will be sound and prudent. Mr. Miller 's recent visit to Europe and America, and his inquiries into what may be called the machinery of banking, add to his qualifications for the position.  Possibly the daily newspapers have made too much fuss over the delay in the appointment of the Governor. It was to be expected that the difficulty of finding the right man, and of arranging terms with him would prove to be a serious one. The necessary qualifications are great and numerous. The Governor will have to establish principal offices in all the States, select and organize the staffs, set up or advise in the establishment of a London branch, and arrange for correspondents in every important country. He must have a perfect knowledge of exchange operations, which means an intimate acquaintance with the monetary systems of the world, the moral courage to prohibit the granting of loans without security, a blissful practice desired by many of the Labour voters, and the ability to attract deposits in a proper and legitimate manner. In short, by his accomplishments and personality, the Governor has to inspire confidence. In every respect, therefore, the appointment of Mr. Miller is satisfactory.

The Leader of the Opposition also declared that Mr. Miller was now receiving three times the salary which he had been paid in his former position. He added that Mr. Miller 's salary was .even larger than that of the Railways Commissioner of New South Wales. I think that it ought to be. Indeed, it would have paid the New South Wales Government to have sent its chief Railways Commissioner back to the country from whence he came with his salary. If the importations that we get for other important positions are of the same class it does not redound to the credit of those who desire to sit upon Australians. I say that Mr. Miller is a competent officer. Senator Millen, as a land agent in New South Wales, earned more in a single day than Mr. Miller will earn in a month It is upon record that the former received a thousand pounds for a few minutes work. I am. not going to say that he should not have received it, but I do say that he ought not to disparage a man because he is getting a fair salary. The banks in Australia are the greatest sweating institutions in the land. They pay men who have to handle thousands of pounds daily the miserable salary of £120 per annum.

He has had literary experience, academic experience of agricultural matters, and upon inquiry I ascertained not only that he is a practical farmer, but that his brothers and relations are all upon the land. Before Senator Millen made the statement which he did, he should at least have taken the precaution to institute inquiries as to Mr. Clarke's fitness for his present position. I believe that he is the best officer the Government could have chosen. He is a young Australian, and is full of life and energy. He has laid himself out to make leasehold settlement in the Territory productive. If that can be done at all he will do it. I compliment the Government upon his appointment. There is just one other matter that I should like to mention. Perhaps there is no honorable senator who is better acquainted with the case to which I am about to refer than I am.

The New South Wales Government have not dispensed with the services of Mr. Garrard . He was appointed for a certain period. The Board is constituted of two members who are nominees of the Government, whilst the rest are elected by the councils of the city and adjoining suburbs. Mr. Garrard was appointed to the office of President of the Board for a term of four years. He served his term, and a better man was put in his place by the Government of the day, which was not a Labour Government. Then Mr. Garrard was again placed on the Board as an ordinary member. His term expired, and he was appointed once more. He has, therefore, had three terms of four years each, to which he had no more right than any other- citizen.  His final term having expired, he goes out of office, and the Government have appointed another man, as they had every right to do. Mr. Garrard's appointment, in the first instance, was purely and simply political. He was once a Labour man, but deserted our cause, and went over to the other side. When he was defeated in his constituency he was appointed to this Board by the Liberal Government of the day. The appointment was made purely for political reasons, though we did not complain about it. Now, however, his term is up, and a man has been appointed who, in my opinion, is more competent. Senator Millen is, or ought to have been, aware of these facts. I believe that he knows as much about the matter as I do, and is well aware that his statement was not correct.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","396","MCDOUGALL, Allan","KTD","N/A","N/A","N/A","880","It has nothing to do with the Federal Government, but as Senator Millen's statements are on record I thought it just as well to answer them. Mr. Garrard is a personal friend of mine, and I have nothing to say against him. He worked with me years ago in an engineer's shop, and when he had done his eight hours' work he attended his place in Parliament at night. He was either the first or the second Labour man elected in New South Wales, and he has been a trades unionist all his life. I think he is president of the Trades Hall Building Trustees today, and no man has taken more interest in the building than he has. I make no complaint against him, but I maintain that the New South Wales Government had every right to appoint another man if they chose. I should like to say a few words with re gard to the Northern Territory. As far as I can see, the appointments made by the Government there have been anything but partisan. Certainly one gentleman has been appointed to the head of the Railway service who is no friend of the Government. He goes about the Territory denouncing Ministers and members of Parliament. I heard him at Darwin, with a crowd around him, denouncing this Government and everything connected with it. He has every right to hold those opinions if he likes, though I do think that a man in his position ought, at all events, to be more discreet. But I do not think that that appointment can be said to have a partisan character. As to the gentleman appointed to the position of Director of the Territory, I can say, from what I saw of him, that I believe him to be the right man in the right place. He holds the same opinions as I do as to the capabilities of the Territory. Some members of the House of Representatives went on a visit to the Territory during the recess, and I joined them. Every member of the party had the same opportunities of seeing the country as I had, but some were either too lazy or too tired to take the trouble to go about much. After we had made one trip to the Katharine River, another journey was organized to the Daly, but Mr. Ozanne and myself were the only two members of the party who undertook the journey. We saw there some of the finest country I ever saw in my life. I never thought that there was such beautifully watered and richly productive country in Australia. I observe that a gentleman who has a seat in the other House said that he had not full opportunities of seeing all he desired. Evidently he was too tired to go on this expedition, for he had the same opportunities as I had. Professor Gilruth is, in my opinion, an admirable man for the position of Administrator. I do not think that a better one could have been found. He is a scientific man, and his knowledge with reference to animal life and diseases will be of great assistance, for the prevalence of these diseases is one of the great drawbacks to advancement in the Territory. Professor Gilruth has the necessary skill to diagnose such cases, and to discover the proper treatment for them. If his scientific skill can get rid of or minimize horse and cattle diseases, the benefit to the Territory will be enormous. While I was there one thing that struck me more forcibly than anything else was the manner in which the whole of the business of the place has drifted into the hands of the Asiatics. When we arrived at Darwin the Administrator, in his democratic way, inaugurated a garden party to welcome us. He did not, in the orthodox fashion of Governors, send out blue and white tickets to distinguish between different classes of visitors, but made no distinction whatever. He simply notified that he would like the residents of Darwin to meet the Minister and members of Parliament, and they came along at the appointed time. There were people of all colours there - blacks, yellows, whites, browns, pie-balds, skew-balds, and all sorts and descriptions; some dressed up in their best, some wearing dress coats, and some with no coats at all.  Everybody was there. When one looks at the population of this place one realizes what might have been the condition of the southern States except for the advanced legislation passed years ago. The main street of Darwin is the most squalid, contemptible place I ever saw. The business is entirely in the hands of Chinese and Syrians, or other Asiatic peoples. They have captured the whole place. Some of the Chinese were born in the Territory. A number of Chinese and half-caste children came down to meet us, singing, ' God save the King! ' It was very nice, of course, and I have nothing to say to the detriment of these people. They are there, and we have to hail them as brothers as long as they are there. But we must take care that no more of that class come into the Territory. After I came back, I had some controversy with a gentleman, in the Sydney newspapers, with regard to the climate of the Territory. Some people contend that it could only be populated by alien races. Dr. Arthur made a statement to that effect, and we have another gentleman lecturing in England contending that the Northern Territory can only be developed 'by coloured labour. I rejoice, however, to think that this Government will do its duty, and is determined to keep Australia white. I say that white men can thrive there. On the Daly River I made the acquaintance of two young men who went without assistance to the Territory, and now have one of the finest farms it was ever my good fortune to see. They grow magnificent maize, and their only trouble is that they cannot get their produce to market. Directly the Government see their way to make roads, or to improve water communication, I have no doubt that the settlers in the Territory will do well. It will become one of the greatest sugar-cane growing districts in Australia. They have cane growing on the Daly flats which has reached a height of 12 feet in four months. We are told by some sugar experts that the rain -descends too heavily at particular times for the sugar crops, and that sugar requires periods of dry weather between the periods of rainfall. I have no doubt, however, that sugar-growing will be successfully accomplished. The dews are so heavy that even when rain does not fall they are suffiCient to produce good crops. When the grass grows very high, and is burnt down by the settlers, the result of the dews is -that, within a week after burning, beautiful green grass springs up again. We are told that the grass is not good for cattle, because it is too coarse. Of course it is when it grows to a great height, but it fs wholesome and fattening when it is young. At present there is not sufficient stock fo eat it down. I thoroughly commend the Government for the appointments which they have made in the Territory. I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition has not ventured to tell us what his party would be prepared to do if they got into office at the next election. Senator Millen professes to believe that they will obtain power. He has not told us whether they would repeal the Socialistic legislation of which we have heard so much. We have not heard a word on that subject, but have simply been treated to the abuse of the administration of the Government. I do not think that the administration has been of the very best. I am not altogether satisfied with it. In fact, I am very much dissatisfied. But the policy of the Government is good, and the measures that they have placed on the statute-book are those which the people of Australia put them in office to pass. There never has been a Government that has not been guilty of some foolish acts of administration. I am not altogether satisfied with the administration of the Defence Department. I fear that the Department is putting up too great a barrier against the freedom of the people. The day may come when the youths who are being trained to-day will refuse to be used as they are being used by the upstart officers who are training them. The day may come - it ma}' be distant - when the' people will insist on reversing the decision of Parliament in the matter of compulsory training. I say that we are building up a sort of army which. is between a permanent army and militia. We have volunteers who are being trained by permanent men. The Government in their administration of the Defence Department are making a mistake. I intend, at a later period, to speak still further on that matter, but will not do so to-night. I think that the Leader of the Opposition, with his great political experience, should have given us an idea of how his party would like to rule the Commonwealth. But they have not done that. They have simply alluded to acts of administration by the Government. They have allowed their womenfolk to formulate a programme for their guidance when they get into power. I believe that the womenfolk have sent to the Parliamentary party the programme which they desire to have translated into legislative Acts next session. It has been handed to me by a friend, and I believe that the information is more reliable than was that of Senator Millen when he made the charges against the Government.

One of the most humorous events of the campaign was the circulation of a placard throughout the electorate claiming the result of those elections as a victory for the Liberal party.

I was led to speak as I did by interjections, which were made during my speech. We were invited to consider the great victories obtained by the party opposite. The so-called victory in Tasmania was one, and it has placed the Government of that State in a position which, so far as my knowledge goes, no other Government in any British community ever occupied. They ave hanging on to office when virtually defeated. They also claim the result of the referenda as a victory, so great and crushing that in their opinion the Labour party ought immediately to have resigned office when they found the will of the people expressed against them. Well, let us compare the voting for Werriwa at the referenda and at the recent by-election. In round numbers, the votes recorded in the Werriwa district at the referenda against the Labour party were 8,000, and for the Labour party 4,000. Within twelve months a by-election took place in the district, and the Labour party not only won back what they had lost on the occasion of the referenda, but increased their vote from 4,000 to 10,883. The other side increased their vote only from 8.000 to 10,500. If it be claimed that the voting at the referenda was a victory for the opposite party, I think I am' justified in saying that it was merely a skirmish, and when the parties came face to face at the recent election the verdict of the referenda was reversed. In the contest for the Werriwa seat we had no advantage over the party opposite. The candidate run by the Fusion party had previously represented the constituency, and had suffered defeat by only 500 votes. The candidate we ran for Werriwa, though an excellent man, was new to politics, and yet his votes were six more than the number polled by Mr. Hall, one of our ablest campaigners, when he defeated Mr. Ryrie for the same electorate. The Leader of the Opposition said that honorable members on this side would take good care not to refer to Werriwa.

When Senator E. J. Russell was seconding the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, .he asked the Opposition to say what piece of legislation passed by this party had ever injured any one in the community. The only reply to his question was made by another of my colleagues in the representation of New South Wales. Senator Walker said that a friend of his had lost two-thirds of his income by the passing of the land tax. Senator Walker is a man who has a very big reputation in New South Wales, and probably throughout Australia, in matters of finance. His word is taken whenever he gives it, and I am not doubting his statement that his friend lost two-thirds of his income because of the operation of the land tax. That is the honorable senator's most serious charge against the legislation we have passed. But let us see how the matter works out. If a mar owns land of the unimproved value of £5,000, he pays no Federal land tax at all. If he has land of the unimproved value of £10,000 he pays an annual tax of £24 and a few odd shillings. It is clear, therefore, that if Senator Walker 's friend held land of the unimproved value of £10,000, and lost two-thirds of his income as a result of the operation of the tax, he must have been making something less than £37 a year out of his property. When a man holds land of the unimproved value of ,£10,000 it will usually be found to be worth double that amount if the value of the improvements upon it are taken into account. We may, therefore, assume that Senator Walker 's friend held property of a total value of £20,000, and was making less than. £37 a year out of it. I say that if the Government steps in and interferes with men who handle landed property in that way it is not only a good thing for the country, but for the owners of the land themselves. If Senator Walker 's friend was compelled to sell his land, and got only about half its value for it, he should be getting a few hundred pounds a year from the money he was paid for it instead of a paltry £37. The same argument will apply if we follow out the operation of the land tax with respect to estates of the highest value. Senator Millen took good care not to make any statement on this subject.

Senator Millen attacked the Government for having made political appointments, because out of the many appointments which the Government have made he was able to say that two gentlemen who received positions, and a third party who was offered a position, were at some time in their lives connected with the Labour movement. I can quite understand that it came as a shock to Senator Millen and his friends to hear that any one connected with the Labour movement had been appointed to a Government position. I make no secret of my views, and I say that I hope that after the next election some more Labour appointments will be made.

The facts are these : The Admiralty have employed at Garden Island a number of civilians as leading hands and in other capacities. When the Commonwealth takes over the Naval Depôt, some of these men will not be able to proceed with the Imperial naval authorities to New Zealand. I wish to know whether it is the intention of the Government to make arrangements for retaining them in the positions which they have occupied for twelve or fifteen years? The naval men will be compelled to go to New Zealand, but it should be optional for the others to go or not, as they please. They are resident in Sydney, and have their homes there. I trust that provision will be able to be made for them.  ","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","518","MILLEN, Edward","KUL","New South Wales","N/A","N/A","890","I am rather surprised that Ministers - assuming that they desire to get on with business - did not take the opportunity before moving the adjournment, at any rate, to explain the first Bill upon the notice-paper. If the second reading had been moved to-night, the Senate would have been in a position to proceed with the debate tomorrow. The course adopted suggests to me that Ministers were not ready. I hope, at any rate, that they will not make a practice of moving the adjournment at a quarter past 9 when there is business immediately in front of us. I presume that it would not have occupied more than half-an-hour for a Minister to move the second reading of the Bill to-night, and the effect would have been to expedite business. There is another matter which I should like to mention to you, Mr. President. I do not know whether I am expressing the opinion of other honorable senators, but I am certainly expressing my own feeling when I say that some steps ought to be taken, either to induce the Meteorologist to alter the weather, or to persuade the Home Affairs Department to assist in improving the temperature of this chamber. I do not know how other honorable senators have felt to-day, but to me the temperature of the place in which we have to do our work has been painfully cold. If, as seems to be the case, honorable senators generally are of the same opinion, steps might be taken to remedy the grievance of which we complain.

Of course, we have not yet been informed by the Admiralty as to what members of their staff they wish to retain, and what members will be left with us. But I can assure Senator McDougall that when further communications have taken place as to what members of the staff are to remain with us, I will give consideration to the representations that he has made. When honorable senators read the papers which I have laid upon the table to-day, they will understand why, owing to the delay in completing the ships that are being built in Great Britain, we are suggesting to the Admiralty that, instead of taking over the depôt on the 1st of April next, it should be taken over on the 1st of July. The ships will probably not be here till then, and there is no object in taking over the depot until the Fleet Unit is in commission. Regarding a point raised by Senator Millen, I have to say, with respect to the Defence Bill, that I do not anticipate that any honorable senator will ask for an adjournment when I move the second reading. No great principle is involved. It is essentially a Bill for Committee. I was assuming that, after I have moved the second reading tomorrow, honorable senators would be prepared to speak to the motion and proceed with the Bill in Committee, so that we may go right through. That is one reason why I did not think it necessary to move the second reading to-night.  ","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It has always been the practice that, when a debate on any subject was finished after 9 o'clock, the Senate would, in the usual course of things, adjourn. The Trade Marks Bill, the Service and Execution of Process Bill, and the Copyright Bill are all ready to be proceeded with, and I was prepared to move the second reading of one of them to-night.

It must be borne in mind that the wisest people cannot make provision against extremes, and although in ordinary circumstances the Senate may be warmed to our requirements, we have recently had one or two of the coldest nights of the year - the coldest, indeed, for many years. The matter is, however, in charge of the President, and I have no doubt that he will take notice of what has been said, as it is always his endeavour to attend to the comfort of honorable senators.

During the dinner adjournment I made some inquiries, and found that the machinery which has been installed down below for the transmission of hot air to the two chambers is on the other side of the building. The consequence is that the other House gets the first supply, and what is to spare is driven along to the Senate chamber by a fan. . Apparently the machinery is not sufficiently powerful. I will see that representations are made to the Home Affairs Department, and, if possible, some alterations effected.  Question resolved in the affirmative.
