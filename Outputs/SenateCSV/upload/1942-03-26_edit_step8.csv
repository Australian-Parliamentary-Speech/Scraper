The Prices Commissioner has now fixed the maximum price for the best quality blue peas at 15s. a bushel and for grey peas at 9s. a bushel. The Prices Commissioner has submitted to me the following statement relative to this determination : -  ","ACQUISITION OF PEAS","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In addition account was taken of the increases in costs since the outbreak of war. The average price received by growers in the five years 1933-4 to 1937-8 was 5s.6d a bushel for blue peas and 5s. 8d. a bushel for grey peas. On account of a abort crop and increased demand in 1938-9, prices for blue peas rose to 18s. 3d. a bushel and for grey peas to 9s.6d. a bushel. Later, owing to the British Government's purchases, the price for blue peas rose further to 21s.a bushel, and even higher prices have prevailed during the war.The objective of price controlis to provide forincreased costssince the outbreak of warand, if necessary, tore view the basic price at the outbreak of war if that price was regarded as being toolow. The fact that under demand for export a great increase in price had taken placedoes not in any way establish the equity of such a price for domestic consumption. In certain exportable goods domestic prices have been fixed at prices below export levels. This is true even in primary products such as hides and skins, tin, lead and zinc, and is true for a wide range of manufactured goods, the prices of which would have risensubstantially had they been brought up to thelevel of prices ruling abroad or to theequivalent of import parity.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","5","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","In the case of blue peas substantial quantities were produced in the years before the war at an average price of 5s.6d. a bushel. The average output in bushels for the years 1933-4 to1937-8 was approximately 150,000 bushels, but the output was declining slightly and this may be regardedas an indication that theaverage price overthese yearswas too low. Consequently, in determining a price consideration was givennot only to the increase in costs since the outbreak of war, but also to the desirability of raising the basic pre-war price. After discussions with the chairman of theFieldPeas Board the most liberal allowancethat could be made for increased costs sincethe outbreak of war was fixed at 5s. 2d. a bushel. This would have given a price based upon the experience of the pre-war years of10s.8d., and I am satisfied that the allowance for increased costs was too great. With the price fixed at 15s. a bushel, the basic pre-war price has been raisedby at least 4s. 4d. a bushel and the new price isa little more than two and a half times the prices prevailing in the five-year period before the war.  An interesting aspect of the problem is that the price ofblue peas, on account of the British Government's offer to purchase certain quantities, rose substantially more than the price of grey peas. The determination now made places the price of blue peas substantially higher than that of grey peas, but the maximum price asked by Tasmanian growers for grey peas was only 9s. a bushel. On prewar experience a price of blue peas at more than double the price of grey peas could not be justified. It was impossible, however, to overlook altogether the effect of the British Government's price of 21s. a bushel for blue peas, and consequently the price of15s. now fixed places sellers of blue peas ata considerable advantagecompared with the sellers of grey peas. Had a price of 21s. been fixed, the advantagewould have been even greater, despite the fact that on pre-war experience there was no such differentiation in the prices of the twoproducts. The payment of a price of 21s. a bushel for blue peas was entirely due to the British Government offering to pay such a price, and it is quite contrary to the principles of price control to fix prices at the point where purchasers might offer to buy regardless of pre-war prices and increased costs since theoutbreakof war. The price to the growers of 15s.a bushel is exclusive of handling costs. ","ACQUISITION OF PEAS","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In doing so, I should like to remind honorable sena to rs of what we are up against to -day in this war. The present international conflict is somewhat different from other wars in which the Empire has been forced to take part. Men and women in many parts of the world have been deprived of ownership of body, soul and mind by the decree of a ruthless dicta to r whose only creed is brute force. This monstrous thing has spread from frontier to frontier, destroying religion, conscience, freedom and security. I do not believe in violence; I believe in law and order, and justice, but I cannot see any way of s to pping this menace except by physical force, just as we should restrain a dangerous lunatic or a wild beast. At the same time, we must not, and I hope that we shall not, forget the principles for which we are fighting. We are fighting for freedom - freedom of conscience, speech, worship and of life itself. That is why I wish to approach this matter in a fair and just spirit. Undoubtedly there are genuine grounds, mainly religious grounds, upon which an objection to military service can be based. I have the greatest respect for the Society of Friends, commonly known in Great Britain as the Quakers, but they did not wait until war broke out to declare their beliefs; they have held strong views on this matter even before the foundation of the organization. What is more, they do not object to undertaking non-combatant service. Some friends of raine in Great Britain are Quakers, and they belong to the Society of Friends' Field Ambulance, which works in the East End of London during ' blitzes'. There is also a bomb disposal squad, consisting entirely of Quakers. There 13 no more hair-raising job than that. It is a task which I should not care, to undertake. It includes the removal of time bombs and delayed-action bombs which may explode at any moment. Those bombs are carried to such places as Hackney Marsh, where they are exploded or rendered harmless. Quite a number of men have lost their lives in the course of this dangerous work. I concede that genuine conscientious objec to rs should be granted exemption from combatant duties, but to exempt such people from non-combatant work at a time such as this, when the safety of our country is imperilled, is not right, fair or just to the rest of the community. Yet that is the effect of these regulations which have been designed to effect considerable changes in existing laws relating to the liability of persons to undergo military service if they conscientiously object to so doing. Section 61 of the Defence Act at present exempts such persons from service of a combatant nature. The regulations made under the National Security Act are based, in the main, on the existing law of the United Kingdom, which provides that any person who has conscientious objections to performing any military, naval, or air force service, including combatant and non-combatant service, may apply to be registered as a conscientious objec to r. I have before me copies of the appropriate British act and our own Defence Act. At a first glance it would appear that Australia had adopted the British act -mi to to , but that is not so.  Paragraph b of su b -section6 of section 5 of the British National Service (Armed Forces) Act, Ch. 81, of 1939, is quite different from su b -paragraph ii of paragraph c of su b -regulaltion 1 of regulation 10 promulgated b y the Government in that it provides that a conscientious o b jector who is conditionally registered must undertake work of a civil nature specified b y a tri b unal under civilian control. Furthermore, if so directed b y the Minister, the o b jector must undergo training provided b y the Minister whereas our regulations require a conscientious o b jector to do these things only if he is so directed b y the Minister for La b our andNational Service at rates of pay and conditions prescri b ed b y him. That is the important difference b etween the two laws. If the Commonwealth Minister for La b our and National Service does not direct an o b jector to perform work or undergo training, that person is not o b liged to render com b atant or noncom b atant service. At a time like this it is wrong that any man should b o exempt from non-com b atant service. Section 61 of the Defence Act sets out the classes of persons who are exempt from military service. The list is long, and I do not propose to read it in full, b ut it includes mem b ers of Parliament, judges of Federal and State courts, ministers of religion, and mem b ers of police forces. Exemption is also extended to the following: (h.) Persons who are not su b stantially of European origin or descent, of which the medical authorities appointed under the regulations shall b e the judges: Persons who satisfy the prescribed authority that their conscientious beliefs do not allow them to bear arms; However, the section includes the following proviso: - ","Motion to Disallow Regulations","CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1/speech/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","75","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","This proviso has an important bearing upon my argument. There are certain religious sects whose claims to have conscientious objections should not be considered for one moment. One such sect has been proscribed as an illegal organization. I refer to the body known as Jehovah's Witnesses. I have no sympathy for its members. As for other organizations, such as the Society of Friends and the Quakers, who have sincere conscientious objections to the taking of life, I would not allow them to escape service of a non-combatant nature if they wished to do so. If appellants can establish the sincerity of their beliefs, they should certainly be excused from combatant service, but there could be no justification for excusing them from non-combatant duties. So-called conscientious objectors also include persons who arc either actively or passively disloyal - I hope that their numbers are small. Then there are people who have very elastic consciences and who suddenly discovered, upon the outbreak of war, that they had conscientious objections to military service. Claims for exemption made by such persons should he subjected to thorough and exhaustive examinations. Under the regulations which I am discussing a conscientious objector has the right of appeal from the decision of the court of summary jurisdiction by which his case is heard.I do not believe in allowing the right of appeal. The definition of ' conscientious objector ' in the regulation is so wide as to give anybody an opportunity to claim exemption on the grounds of conscientious objection to military service. The definition is as follows : - ' Conscientious objector ' includes any conscientious belief, whether the ground thereof is or is not of a religious character, and whether the belief is or is not part of the doctrine of any religion.  This makes the way easy for men who suddenly decide that they have a conscientious objection to military service. I am willing to excuse conscientious objectors from combatant service - although, at a time like this, I cannot understand the state of mind of men who would refuse to do such duty - but they should certainly be compelled to pull their weight with their fellow citizens by rendering noncombatant service as directed by the Minister. I have before me the New Zealand regulations dealing with conscientious objectors, as amended up to the 14th May, 1941. They provide that a person cannot escape non-combatant service. A man may secure exemption from combatant service, on the ground of conscientious objection, buthe must perform noncombatant duties in the military forces. How could any man bring forward a reasonable or logical excuse for not rendering military service of a non-combatant nature in a time of grave national danger such as the present? The New Zealand regulations contain a further valuable provision to the effect that the financial position of a person who succeeds in securing exemption from combatant service on conscientious grounds should be nobetter as the result of his non-combatant service than it would be if he were serving as a combatant member of the armed forces. The same provision applies to exempted men who are put into camps to perform work of a useful nature to the community. The Commonwealth regulations permit an objector to avoid both combatant and non-combatant service. I do not profess to have much legal knowledge, and I confessthat the jargon in which our numerous regulations are shrouded causes me to have mental indigestion; I have great difficulty in interpreting them. The regulations are based in the main on the existing law, butprovide that any person who has conscientious objections to performing military, naval or air force service, including both combatant and noncombatant duties, may apply to be registered as a conscientious objector. They could therefore escape service of any kind. In the New Zealand House of Representatives, the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Nash, stated on the 27 th August, 1941, regarding conscientious objectors and the regulations promulgated in that dominion that- ","Motion to Disallow Regulations","CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1/speech/para[4]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Political interference with the functions of the Commonwealth or State Arbitration Courts, under the powers given to Ministers under the National Security Act, is deplorable. A large section of the people was amazed at the action of the Government during a sitting of the full bench of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court on the 23rd February last, when an application for the fixation of the rates of wages to be paid to females in a certain industry was being heard. A representative of the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), the liaison officer to the Minister for 'War Organization of Industry (Mr. Dedman) and secretary of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions attended the court and requested it not to deal with the application as the Commonwealth Government intended to review the matter. With dramatic suddenness, according to the press report, the court adjourned. 1 have never previously heard of such an action. I remind the Senate that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration has made approximately 100 awards for women engaged in industry, and the State courts of New South Wales about 149 of such awards. The introduction by the Government of Statutory Rule No. 2 of 194 2 provides further evidence of political interference. These regulations relate to the wages of men engaged in the maritime industry. We find the Government compelled to take the matter out of the hands of the Arbitration. Court and set up a special tribunal in order to comply with the request of prominent members of the Labour party and of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. This was done after conferences at Canberra between the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) and other members of the Government, in order to satisfy members of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions who pass votes of confidence in the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward) and the Minister for Aircraft Production (Senator Cameron) but votes of censure on the Prime Minister. I object to the Minister for Aircraft Production or the Minister for Munitions (Mr. Makin), who are old and prominent members of the Labour party, under the guise of war-time needs, taking this ma tter out of the hands of 'the Arbitration Court and having wages and other conditions fixed to suit their own political supporters- This is intolerable, and I ask the Senate to vote for the disallowance of the statutory rule.

I should like to think that it is the result of the remarks I made yesterday concerning a waste of the time of the Senate. The statutory rule under consideration is very short and no legal phraseology has been employed to cloud the issue. The Leader of the Opposition has been most definite in his statements, but has not submitted adequate reasons for the disallowance of the statutory rule. I do not desire to be unfair to the honorable senator. I took notes of his remarks and listened carefully to all that he had to say, and I do not think that I am misrepresenting him when I claim that apparently his only objection to these regulations is that he does not like certain people and certain institutions which those people represent. He did not. say that the regulations were at fault except in one particular. He did not examine them word by word in order to demonstrate that they were defective or dangerous, or that they would be inoperative. He merely used the motion for their disallowance as an opportunity to say in this chamber what he frequently says as proof of his objection to certain people, and to the principles for which they stand. The only constructive element in the honorable senator's speech was his suggestion that this matter should be dealt with by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Whether this question should be decided in the manner provided by these regulations or by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is a matter concerning which there is room for a fair difference of opinion. The Leader of the Opposition represents in this chamber certain political interests as he has a perfect right to do, hut I have never known him, or those interests, to reveal any desire to preserve the functions and decisions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and therefore this new enthusiasm on the part of the honorable gentleman leaves me almost speechless. I have lived through the struggle from the bad old days when there was not one vestige of industrial regulation in this country. I have taken a personal and active part in the campaign for regulating industry, and although I have not paid for that activity in blood and tears, I have paid for it in economic isolation and victimization. I have done my part to build up the conciliation and arbitration system which is now incorporated in the law of this land.

The natural inclination of the workers of Australia is to resent government by regulation, because by such means they are compelled to do things which in normal times' they would not dream of doing. If there is one thing more than another of which we on this side are proud it is the fact that, without coercion or pressure, the great industrial organizations of Australia have said in effect to the Prime Minister of Australia, ' Go ahead, we will give you all you want. We do not like some of the things that are done, but we shall do what is required of us because of the critical situation which is facing this country. We : will give you a 100 per cent, war effort.'  Not only the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, but more particularly some of its officers, upset the Leader of the Opposition. I believe that I could name themembers of that organization who disturbed the bile of the honorable gentleman.

Least of all do 1 imagine that the Loader of the Opposition believes that that great statesman who is leading this nation in its hour of greatest trial would be instrumental in issuing a regulation merely because some one said flattering things about him.

In practically all of those cases the Government's action has been dictated by unions which have refused to abide by the court's awards. An instance of this kind was provided only recently in the coal-mining industry. Some time ago-, following a series of disturbances and stoppages in the industry, the Prime Minister (Mr. Cur tin) himself stated bluntly to the coal-miners that they must either produce coal or go into the army. That statement was received with approbation by the people as a whole. However, since the Prime Minister had made that very strong pronouncement, no action has been taken. The Government party claims credit for the establishment of our industrial arbitration system; but it does not itself attempt to ensure that the awards of the court are enforced. More recently still, a judge of the court, dealing with an application affecting the coal-mining industry, gave a decision allowing certain machines to be used for the development of coal seams, but the Prime Minister himself caused the postponement of the operation of that award.

We should oppose the granting of this power to any Minister by any government regardless of its political colour. Decisions of this nature should be left to properly constituted tribunals. No government should resort to a regulation of this kind except in a case of extreme emergency, and only then in respect of that period for which an industry is obliged to await the decision of a properly constituted tribunal.

Our immediate difficulty is to obtain, sufficient skilled employees for war factories. If we cannot obtain males, we must obtain females for that work. In the last war, many women were employed in war factories at a lower rate than males engaged on similar work. Those women were exploited. Many employers to-day are only too ready to exclude men, and increase the number of -female employees, in order to lower their costs of production and to increase their profits. For this reason, I should like to see these regulations applied to females in all industry with the object of prescribing equal pay for the sexes in respect of similar work. I should he happy to leave the responsibility for the administration of such regulations to the Minister for Aircraft Production (Senator Cameron), lie is doing an excellent job. He has shown himself to be more competent in his department than any of his predecessors. I have no doubt that he is just as anxious as any one else for the success of our war effort. He knows exactly the labour requirements of the aircraft industry at the present juncture. He may be obliged to introduce a number of women into other industries associated with the production of aircraft. If women capable of doing this work are available, whether it be skilled or ordinary labouring work, and they are put to these tasks, they are entitled to receive the same remuneration as males. Honorable senators who declare that the Minister is not a fit person to administer these regulations lack sincerity. Those who have visited our war factories realize that women employed in those factories are doing their work as efficiently as men. I have been informed by managers of various factories that the women are doing a better job than males. Consequently, I should like to see the principle of equal pay to the sexes for equal work adhered to in all of our war industries. We pride ourselves upon our democratic fair play. If that be so, it is difficult to understand why honorable senators opposite quibble over these regulations. I deplore the venomous attack made upon the Minister for Aircraft Production by the Leader of the Opposition. The honorable senator dislikes the Minister personally. He has said so .repeatedly in this chamber, and at every opportunity he endeavours to discredit the Minister. Indeed, he has gone so far as to say that the Minister is disloyal.

First, however, I should like to deal with what has been said by Senator McBride . Obviously, the honorable senator spoke in ignorance, which is nothing new for him. When I was appointed Minister for Aircraft Production, not one woman was employed hy the Government in the aircraft industry, although negotiations for the employment of women were in progress with the various trade unions.

Time was of the essence of the contract, and I gave my immediate approval to engage as many women as were required under conditions similar to those operating in munitions industries in which women were already employed.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","116","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Under this motion I desire to secure the disallowance of one of the regulations contained in Statu to ry Rules 1941, No. 275, which relates to the setting up of fair rents boards and, generally speaking, provides for action through these boards for the fixation of fair rents for premises and for control over the eviction of tenants. I am concerned onlywith regulation 25, which provides that parties to the proceedings may be represented by an agent. If the regulation s to pped there, I should have no objection to it, but sub-regulation 3 provides that ' The agent shall not, without the consent of all parties or persons affected, or, unless the At to rney-General has intervened by counsel, be a barrister or solici to r, or a clerk of a barrister or solici to r'. In other words, the regulation expressly excludes from the right of appearance before these bodies a section of professional men who have been trained for the purpose of performing duties of this kind. I have endeavoured to determine for my own satisfaction; what possible justification there can be for such a regulation, but I confess that I have not been able to find any justification 'whatsoever. After all, the regulations deal with matters which are the everyday concern of lawyers - matters upon which it would be most natural for those concerned with applications before these tribunals to consult lawyers. Suppose, for example, a woman in occupation of certain premises received a notice from her landlord intimating that he proposed to apply to the Fair Rents Court for the fixation of a fair rent, probably in excess of that which the woman was paying. What would such a tenant be likely to do? Her husband might he overseas in the Australian ImperialForce, and immediately she would look around for some one of competence to help her to deal with the matter. I suggest that the first, and most natural thing for the woman to do would be to go to a lawyer in order to obtain competent advice as to what action she should take and what were her rights under these regulations.It would be difficult to find any other person in the community who could competently advise such a tenant. Having consulted a lawyer, no doubt he would tell the woman that she had to appear before a fair rents court. In these circumstances, it would be very natural for her to say, ' Well, of course, you will appear for me '. But lo and behold, the lawyer has to say, 'I am sorry, but I cannot appear for you; you must get some other agent '. If the woman were unable to get a competent agent, then presumably she would have to accept the services of an incompetent one, -because she is forbidden by this regulation to obtain the assistance of a man -who is trained to understand these very matters. There is another curious thing about this regulation. fi it happened that the woman to whom I referred knew of a person who had been a solici to r, but who, owing to his misappropriation of clients-5 money, had been struck off the roll of barristers and solici to rs, she could employ that person to appear before the tribunal. He would be permitted to appear, but a barrister and solici to r, practising his profession honestly and competently, and abiding by the rules of ethics which bind the profession, would be forbidden to plead the woman's case. That is a ridiculous position. I know that it is popular in some quarters to assume that whenever a lawyer enters in to proceedings his clients will have to bear heavy costs. This is due to the fact that we hear very occasionally of legal proceedings of a protracted nature which have committed people to substantial expenditure. The persons who hold this idea overlook the fact that every day hundreds of solici to rs appear in the courts of this country on behalf of poor people for very small fees. These solici to rs protect the people against injustice. Is there any basis of justice in a regulation which provides that a landlord, who probably employs a competent estate agent, may be represented before the tribunal by that agent, whilst the complainant may not employ a solici to r? The landlord may pay the agent whatever fee he wishes, and the agent may be a man of considerable business capacity, and, if the landlord is wealthy, he will see that the agent is completely instructed by a barrister or solici to r as to the course that he shall pursue. In my experience, very few tenants are likely to consult estate agents in order to secure assistance in an undertaking of this kind. Therefore, unless they are prepared to go before the tribunal themselves and endeavour to compete with trained agents of the landlord, they are at a complete disadvantage.

I do not ask that the right of audience of lawyers before these tribunals should be exclusive. All that I ask is that a person who desires to employ a trained advocate should be entitled to do so. I have seen other tribunals in operation before which not only barristers and solicitors, hut also lay advocates have been permitted to appear. I assure honorable senators that people do not save money or time by employing lay advocates. In my experience the effect of employing such persons has often been that clients have paid good money for the services of bad advocates. I do not propose to occupy much time in dealing with this subject. The only part of this regulation to which I object is that which deliberately prevents the right of audience before these tribunals of barristers and solicitors. There is no justification whatever for such a provision. If the Minister were prepared to indicate to me that he would have sub-regulation 3 of regulation 25 repealed, I should bc willing to withdraw my motion. The provision creates an injustice which affects not only the profession to which I happen to belong - I am not particularly concerned with that aspect, of the matter - but also the people who have not at their command competent agents to undertake the work of representing them before these tribunals. I sincerely hope that the Minister will take steps to have this sub-regulation removed from the statutory rule.

I still fail to see why legal advice should be needed either by the landlord or the applicant. A working man renting a house in Melbourne may complain because his rent has been raised by 6s. a week. He can go to the nearest clerk of courts and lay a complaint, which will be listed with others and heard by a magistrate in the Fair Rents Court. The complainant will be able to explain his financial position to the magistrate and state for what period he has rented the house, what rental he has been paying, the amount of his weekly earnings, and the extent of the repairs that have been effected to the property. The owner will then be able to state his case. He need not employ an agent to do so. Surely any man can do a simple thing like that? The magistrate, having heard the arguments, may then proceed to the house and inspect it. He may give his decision in the backyard of the property, or in his own chambers. There is no doubt that, by this costless procedure, poor people who arc afflicted by high rentals are able to obtain certain and quick justice.

The rent is based on the capital cost of the building, plus the ordinary rate charges and the cost of any renovations carried out by the owner. If the honorable gentleman had been a member of the Joint Committee on Social Security, as I was for a period, he would have learned that many grave injustices are being perpetrated in every State. Many of these injustices have been curtailed by these regulations. The National Security (Fair Rent) Regulations, which operated in Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania prior to the promulgation of this regulation, permitted parties to proceedings taken under it to be represented by barristers or solicitors. There is no evidence that this opportunity was availed of to any great degree. In fact, a feature of the operation of the regulations in Victoria was that parties usually conducted their own cases. The proceedings were very informal. Parties who could not afford legal representation were made to feel that their cases were not prejudiced by their inability to pay for assistance. Tenants engaged legal assistance more often than landlords. I consider that a person's economic position should not be a barrier to fair treatment, and wealthy members of the community should not have an advantage over others. Whilst there has been a certain amount of agitation for the granting of the right to secure legal representation before these tribunals, no cases have been brought to the notice of the Government in which either a landlord or a tenant has suffered as the result of not having legal assistance. Many poor and uneducated personsrun the risk of not doing their cases justice when they are opposed by trained advocates. The existing regulation is not a barrier to legal representation, provided that all parties are in agreement on the subject. I took an active part in the drafting of this part of regulation 25. 3 was a member of the Social Security Committee when it took evidence in Melbourne, on the 4th August, 1941, from Mr. W. O. Burt, a barrister and solicitor, who is a member of the Housing Commission of Victoria. Mr. Burt said in evidence that the then existing Fair Rents Court procedure was not operating fairly to applicants for relief.

This means in some cases a total loss of Â£2. The tenant is obliged (if he is able to procure one) to employ a valuer whose fee amounts to about Â£3 3s. The tennant is further obliged to pay the valuer Â£11s. for his attendance at court and a further Â£2 2s. to Â£3 3s. for a solicitor to represent him. As the landlord always employs a lawyer, the tenant cannot safely dispense with one. It will be seen, therefore, that the tenant may face a total outlay of about Â£10 with the further risk of losing his case and having to pay a great deal more. In other words, a tenant must risk a total of up to Â£20 to obtain the doubtful saving of a few shillings per week.

In the case of higher rentals there might be some justification for the engagement of lawyers in the event of disputes. I am somewhat biased against the employment of legal men in the hearing of these disputes.

Indeed, the Opposition is prepared to withdraw this motion altogether if the Leader of the Senate (Senator Collings) will indicate that the Government is prepared to consider amendments which we suggest should be made to this far-reaching statutory rule. It is perhaps unnecessary for me to state that the reason for moving that this statutory rule be disallowedis that the Senate may have an opportunity to debate the regulations which it contains.  Before I deal with the regulations now under review, I point out that there is danger of considerable confusion arising from the number of statutory rules that have been issued and the exercise of powers conferred by them. In this connexion I hope that the Government will give careful consideration to the suggestion of Senator A. J. McLachlan and that the Parliament will be given an opportunity to consider the far-reaching effects of the numerous regulations that are now being issued. For instance, I hope that, some member of the Government will enlighten me as to the position now existing in Papua, as it is almost impossible for honorable senators to keep abreast of the regulations that are being promulgated weekly. It is no reflection on the Leader of the Senate that he should not be aware of the details of every statutory rule that is issued, because it is almost physically impossible for any man to keep abreast of them all. I should also like a responsible Minister to indicate what the position is in areas like Darwin and other areas which have been declared military areas. I understand that such areas are partly under military control and partly under civil control, and that, in consequence, there has been considerable confusion as to which authority deals with certain matters. Knowing that the military authorities take charge of an area under certain conditions, I do not want to confuse the powers conferred by these regulations with anything that has already been delegated, or is likely to be delegated, to such authorities in the event of an imminent attack on any portion of Australia. But I should like some enlightenment on this subject. Of all the regulations that have been promulgated, none are more far-reaching in theireffects than those contained in Statutory Rules 1942, No. 77. One of the regulations goes too far and should be amended, not in the direction of restricting the powers conferred on the Government, but in order to prevent misunderstanding and chaos in a time of great emergency.Under regulation 4 a Minister, or any other person authorized by a Minister, may direct any person resident in Australia to do certain things. That means that any one of nineteen Ministers of State may authorize any person to direct other persons to do certain things. It is not difficult to visualize the confusion that is likely to take place should those powers be exercised to any considerable degree. That power may be given to any person, and that person can issue instructions to anybody to do anything. Regulation 4 reads - 1.A Minister,or any person authorized by a Minister to give directions under these Regulations, may direct any person resident in Australia - to perform such services as are specified in the direction; to perform such duties in relation to his trade, business, calling or profession as are so specified; to place his property, in accordance with the direction, at the disposal of the Commonwealth. 2.Any such direction may be given so as to apply - to persons generally; to all or any persons in a particular area; to all persons included in a particular class of persons; to any particular person; in respect of property generally; in respect of all or any property in a particular area; in respect of all property included in a particular class of property; or in respect of any particular property, and may be given either orally or in writing. 3.Every person to whom any such direction is applicable shall comply with the direction. First, I suggest that this power of delegation should not be given to nineteen Ministers. It is so far-reaching that it should be given only to the Prime Minister. Secondly, if the delegation of authority is to be retained as set out in the regulation, the class of person to whom these powers may be delegated should be defined. It is unthinkable that these powers may be exercised by anybody. The Government should draw up a list of the persons to whom they may be delegated. I shall not object if that list be exceptionally wide; but some such list is preferable to leaving the matter in its present form. Thirdly, I suggest that directions issued under regulation 4 should be given in writing and not orally. I admit that in some cases of urgency it may be impracticable to issue directions in writing, but all instructions given orally should be confirmed in writing within a reasonable period.

The effect of that particular regulation was that no new members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union could be guaranteed employment, despite the fact that that organization has done a great service to Australia, and includes among its membersmany returned soldiers from the last war and this war. That is evidence of the possibility that Ministers and persons to whom power is delegated under regulation 4 to give certain directions will use it in a. vindictive manner.  When it was first suggested that a move would be made for the disallowance of Statutory Rules 1942. No. 77, reports appeared in the press that a Government spokesman said that those regulations were necessary in order to enable the Government to compel strikers to return to work, or to enlist them in labour battalions. Perhaps, also, the Government required power to enable it to tell members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourer.Union that they must go into the Army. If the Leader of the Senate says that the powers already possessed by the Government are not sufficient to enable it to deal with agitators and strikers, the Opposition is prepared to give to it any power it deems necessary to discipline people who disobey arbitration court awards. However, the explanation offered by the Government spokesman in the press reports to which I have referred is merely a subterfuge. It is a smokescreen to cover the Government's real intentions. The Government has certainly fallen down on its job in adopting its policy of appeasement to strikers and the few people who by interrupting production menace our war effort. I shall not be deceived by any smokescreen put out by aGovernment spokesman. I remind the Senate that as far back as January the Prime Minister (Mr.Curtin) told a conference of coal-miners who were on strike that they must work or fight. Subsequently, under regulation 27 c of the Coal Control Regulations power was given to the Coal Commission to withdraw exemption from military service from any coal-miner who went on strike. However, strikes have been continually occurring ever since that time. In to-day's press we read that two mines were idle yesterday. Up to date I have seen no evidence that the Government has exercised its power under regulation 27 c. It is useless to say that it requires the power set out in Statutory Rules 1942, No. 77. because it does not already possess such power. What the Government needs to do is to abandon its policy of appeasement towards agitators. Under the economic mobilization regulations the Government took further power to provide that any employee who absented himself from work in specified industries became liable to a fine of Â£100 or imprisonment for six months. At that stage the Government realized that its courage had failed it. It has not yet exercised that power, despite the fact that numerous strikers have refused to work on certain holidays. Now we are told that the Government requires Statutory Rules 1942, No. T7, in order to enable it to overcome these problems. Should that be the argument advanced by the Leader of the Senate on this matter, I repeat that the Opposition is prepared to give to the Government all the power it requires to deal with strikers and industrial agitators as effectively as they should be dealt with in this time of crisis. I have been horrified for the last two or three mouths. I realize the task that lie3 ahead of the Government. Day after day we read of the gigantic effort that is necessary for the defence of this country, but in my opinion the Government is falling down on its job. There has been too much talk and not enough action. Apparently, before anything can be done in the direction of mobilizing certain industries, the trade unionists have to be called to Canberra in order to find out how they will react to the Government's proposals. Wo are told that wo have to do this and we have to do that, but there is little sign of definite action. One of the most vital mistakes that this Government is making is the setting up of various advisory committees. Such bodies serve only to delay matters.' The South Australian Government has requested that action bc taken to deal with the man-power problem on the River Murray, where thousands of internees are dependent on the Murray for their water supply. I am informed that there is an acute shortage of wood for fuel, and that unless the wood is forthcoming there will be no water supply. Apparently the State authorities have been endeavouring for months to get a decision on this matter. Tn one of his famous- war-time speeches, the Prime Minister of Great Britain ( Mr. Churchill ) said that if the Government were to wait for its advisers to give advice on all matters, the war would be lost before any action could be taken. Referring to the incessant clamour for the setting up of committees and other advisory bodies, Mr. Churchill said that if the Government were to accede to all the requests, there would be too much harness and not enough horse. I say in all sincerity that, by promulgating regulations of this kind, the? Government is saddling itself with too much harness, while it lacks sufficient horse to produce the necessary action.

Before proceeding, I. wish to make it clear that I am not a cattle-grower to any extent, and do not represent cattle-growers, so that the matter does not affect me personally. I know the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works farm at Werribee, where many thousands of cattle are raised. The conditions under which these cattle are raised are absolutely filthy, and it is disgraceful that the Government intends to supply meat so produced to our troops.

The men in our armed forces must take the meat that is supplied to them. They have no option, as the civilian has. I ask the Government to recall the cause of the Indian Mutiny. Indian troops were ordered to bite cartridges which were coated with grease. We all know of the bloodshed caused. No man who knows anything about cattle and the conditions at the Werribee farm will eat Werribee beef. The farm covers an area of 20,000 acres; half of it is dry and half of it is wet. The disease of beef measles with which these cattle are infected is caused by the tape-worm which infests humans. Every day, people in 500,000 houses in the city of Melbourne flush their closets, and the sewage is emptied on about 16 acres of ground at Werribee without being submitted to treatment of any sort. Consequently, that small area becomes covered with a putrid mass of human excrement. About 2,000,000 gallons of sewage is emptied on to a 16-acre plot daily. At the end of a period of about fourteen days, the cattle are turned out to graze on the grass on to which this waste matter is deposited. The tape-worm from the sewage creeps up the grass and is eaten by the cattle, which then contract beef measles. Some of the medical men, on whose opinion Senator Cameron seems to rely, say that when these worms are cooked they are harmless. I do not want to eat them, cooked or raw. The only way to eradicate beef measles in Werribee sewage farm cattle would be to remove the cause - the tape-worm. That could be done only by drenching every person in the city of Melbourne as a farmer would drench his sheep. I ask honorable senators to imagine the condition of an area of 16 acres covered with a mass of untreated sewage. The solid substances in the material are held by the roots of the grass, whilst the surplus water percolates to it lower level and then runs out, to the sea. Corio Bay is as black as ink for about half a mile from the shore as the result of this seepage, and the streams which run on that lower level would make a fair substitute for ink. Nevertheless, the Government expects men in our armed forces to eat, the meat produced on that farm. I hope that they will not touch it. At one time, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works sold the milk from cattle which were raised on its farm, but the health authorities soon stopped the practice. Vegetables which were grown there were sold to the people of Melbourne, but that has also been prevented. The farm produces a great growth of vegetable matter, because the quantity of excrement that is deposited on 1 acre of that ground in one night is equivalent to 1 ton of sulphate of ammonia or about 2 tons of superphosphate. In fourteen days, the grass grows about 3 inches. After this growing period, the bullocks are turned out to graze on it. Subsequently, they will go to Melbourne and the beef will be sold, calen, and returned to 'Werribee through the sewer. I ask Ministers whether they would eat that meat. The late Mr. Charles Hawker and I went over that farm on one occasion. The day was not very warm, but when Mr. Hawker turned over a sod with a foot, it was fly-blown.

It was easy to do that, because the odour was abominable. I do not suppose that any member of the present Government, with the possible exception of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Seam;), has inspected that sewage farm. If  Ministers did so, I am sure that they would not force the Victorian Government to market the cattle from the farm for beef. I hope that the Government will reconsider its decision from a common-sense point of view. The Housewives Association of Melbourne has been pressing for the marketing of this beef, but its members know nothing at all about the matter. I invite them and the members of this Government to come with, me on some warm day and have afternoon tea under the willow trees beside one of these turgid drains. I undertake that, if they do so, they will change their tune about Werribee beef. Senator LAMP (Tasmania) [S.29J. - On several occasions I have referred in this chamber to the broadcasting of news services in Tasmania. I now appeal to the Postmaster-General and Minister for Information ( Senator Ashley) to impres.3 upon the Australian Broadcasting Commission the stupidity of broadcasting market reports before the news sessions. Many listeners tune in their radio sets a few minutes before the news is broadcast at 12.30 p.m., 1 p.m., and 1.30 p.m., and sometimes market reports are broadcast for 10 or 15 minutes prior to the 12.30 p.m. news session. I suggest, therefore, that the* Australian Broadcasting Commission should endeavour to make the national programme as attractive as possible at that period of the day. It should not, bc difficult to arrange for the market reports to be broadcast after the news has been announced. In the northern portion of Tasmania there are two commercial broadcasting stations, TEX and TLA, but they are off the air after 9 a.m. on Saturdays, whilst the national station, TNT, closes down from S.30 a.m. to 10 a.m. for essential maintenance work on the transmitter. The people residing in that portion of Tasmania require the services of a broadcasting station between those hours, and at least one station should remain on the air, because an occasion might arise when it would be necessary to make an important announcement to the public. The Victorian stations, 3GI Sale and 3AB Melbourne, can be heard satisfactorily in Tasmania at certain times, but not at others, and the people of Tasmania would not be required to listen to Victorian stations if the services of a local station could be made available to them. I suggest that maintenance work in connexion with the national station in northern Tasmania should be done at times other than Saturday mornings. Motion - byleave - temporarily withdrawn.

Very few of those who are working in essential war industries in Tasmania are aware of the exact nature of the regulations on this matter, despite the notices that have been issued through the daily press. Persons called up. in the State never receive more than seven days' notice. Some of them live in remote parts of the State and even those residing in country towns are not familiar with the procedure that has to bo adopted in order to obtain exemption from military training on the ground that they are engaged in essential industries. By the time they make application to the Deputy Director of Man-power in Tasmania, or to me, who happen to be the representative in that State of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward), and necessary inquiries are made to ascertain whether their statements are correct, it is often too late for them to obtain exemption. They are called into camp and the matter is then out of the hands of the Deputy Director of Man-power.  I ask that the period of notice be slightly increased to enable those who are engaged in industries essential to the successful prosecution of the war to have sufficient time to make their applications and to enable them to be cheeked. This request is made, particularly, in the interests of farmers. I have known cases in which the only man on the farm has been called up in the middle of harvesting operations. Australia will be short of its requirements of potatoes this year by many thousands of acres, yet one farmer who had planted 15 or 20 acres of potatoes andturnips has been called into camp because the notice given to him was insufficient. It is necessary practically to go on one's knees to the commanding officers to get such men out of camp to enable them to attend to the production of essential commodities. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Army to reconsider the reply given to me to-day regarding this matter. I suggest that, except in very urgent circumstances, the seven days' notice should be somewhat increased.

These committees may be appointed in various localities by the Repatriation Commission itself. There are various provisions in the act for the guidance of the committees, including some relating to the collection and expenditure of money. Usually seven persons are appointed to each committee, and the commission has followed the procedure adopted during the last war, when no returned soldiers were appointed to the committees. At a meeting of the Kalgoorlie and Boulder sub-branches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmens Imperial League of Australia I was informed that only one member of that body had been appointed to the local Repatriation Committees. There is no more active or experienced body of returned soldiers than the members of the gold-fields sub-branches of the league at Kalgoorlie and Boulder, and, in my opinion, it would be to the advantage of the Repatriation Commission to have more returned soldiers on the local committees. Those men have had 24 years' experience in repatriation matters, and in many cases have initiated proposals which have led to amendments of the Repatriation Act that have resulted in benefit to returned soldiers generally.  I should like to know if answers to questions on the notice-paper which have not yet been furnished will be forwarded t.o honorable senators.

I should like to draw honorable senators' attention to an article in a London publication, Left News, dated the 1st February, 1941. It recalled that, in the early months of the recent Spanish revolution, the two International Brigades assembled, after the first engagement, to discuss the question of leaders appointed by a men's committee. At that period, the officers so appointed did not Iia ve batmen. The personnel of those brigades were the most deeply political of all of the units in Spain and held reactionary views. They decided that their officers must have a distinguishing uniform, live in separate messes, and each have a batman. For their own personal safety and comfort, the men demanded the utmost professional efficiency from their platoon commanders upwards to brigade commanders. They knew that in a battle a commander must have absolute authority to get things done his way. They realized that an officer who should be arranging for supplies to be brought up, reporting casualties and advising his superior officers on the condition of his men and the tactical possibilities before his unit, should not waste his time in a queue for half an hour, waiting for his issue of mule stew and red-ink wine. The article stated that ' sheer self-preservation induced the troops to demand that their respective commanders should not be scrounging around feeding themselves, looking after their equipment, or wasting time endlessly by arguing the reasons for every order given '. The article went on to say that these tough soldiers of fortune from many foreign countries secured for their officers, before the end of the revolution, a degree of privilege only a little less than that found in the armies of the great powers. In advocating a distinguishing and recognizable uniform, spokesmen from the ranks pointed out that, in the indescribable muddle of a modern battle, all sorts of commanders of different kinds of units appear and move on again. They said that it was impossible to know by sight all the individuals who, in any given battle, may have to give important orders and that therefore it was essential that officers should have some badge of rank, so that their authority could be seen and understood at a glance. They pointed out that distinguishing uniforms for officers are a practical necessity in battle and not simply a means of bolstering the personal vanity of an individual officer. In the Australian Army, a batman is on the strength of a unit, and in an emergency takes his place in the battle-line, for lie is a trained soldier. I recall the 18th and the 19th May, 1915, on Gallipoli, when the Turks made a desperate effort to drive the Australian Imperial Force into the sea. Many batmen manned the front-line trenches on that memorable occasion. A batman helps to prepare and serve his officer's food, looks after his equipment, and generally helps the officer to keep his mind off domestic details, so that he may be free to concentrate on the important matters which the international brigades for their comfort and safety demand that he shall do. Let there be no more loose talk about batmen not being necessary. Only in respect of captains and higher officers has each officer his own batman. During recent years, I do not think there has been any change in the rule that three junior officers have one batman between them.

I therefore refer to the matter now as I should like some information on the subject before the Senate adjourns. In Brisbane, numbers of men have called upon me lately and have stated that, owing to the closing down of nonessential industries, they have been forced out of business. I now call the attention of the Government to this matter, because I believe that, just as there are casualties on the field of battle, so there are casualties in the industrial sphere, and that just as in the military arena we try to save the lives of our soldiers, so in industry we should try to save the lives of those who are injured economically. One man who interviewed me said that he had practically been forced into bankruptcy because two of Ms employees had been taken away from his business by the military authorities. He agreed that, in a time of war, every one should do his bit, but that did not lessen the effect on himself. I tried to save him from financial disaster, hut without avail. Some consideration should be given by the Government to men conducting small businesses who are forced on to the bread-line as the result of war measures.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","179","JOHNSTON, Edward","KP8","Western Australia","N/A","N/A","457","During the last two or three months, I have had an opportunity as a member of the Joint Committee on Rural Industries to hear a good deal of evidence concerning the conditions ofwheat-farmers throughout Australia. I do not wish to anticipate the report of the committee in any way, although that body has thought that certain aspects of our rural industries are so important that it has written to the Prime Minister bringing them to his notice, with a view to immediate action being taken. I wish to bring before the Senate a matter upon which the Joint Committee on Rural Industries heard a good deal of evidence, namely, the urgent necessity to give to wheat farmers a further advance on last season's crop, and also any moneys that may be due to them from earlier pools which have operated since the beginning of the war. For last season's crop the Government guaranteed, under legislation, a price of 3s. l0d. a bushel at ports for a crop of 140,000,000 bushels for the whole of Australia. I am informed on good authority that the crop exceeds 140,000,000 bushels, so that it is doubtful whether 3s. l0d. a bushel will be paid for it under that guarantee. The amount paid so far is 3s. a bushel for bagged wheat, and 2s. l0d. a bushel for wheat in bulk, less freight in each instance. In Western Australia and New South Wales the greater part of the wheat is handled in hulk. The average freight is about 6d. a bushel, the actual charge varying according to the distance of the farm from a port. That means that farmers have received from 2s. 4d. to 2s. 6d. a bushel advance on last year's crop, according to whether the wheat was delivered in bags or in bulk. Farmers' costs have risen in every direction. According to reliable estimates placed before the committee the cost of producing wheat varies from 4s. to 4s. 6d. a bushel. That being so, a wheat-farmer cannot carry on with an advance of only 2s. 4d. or 2s. 6d. a bushel. The cost of superphosphate has increased considerably, and even if it were available in greater quantities, it would be difficult for any farmer to obtain it unless he paid cash. The farmer has no choice in the disposal of his crop as the wheat is compulsorily acquired by the Government. Under the Constitution wheat or any other product may only he acquired on just terms. I submit that that means at least the cost of production. I have always advocated that farmers should be paid the cost of producting wheat, with a reasonable wage, as a minimum price. If the Government wants wheat-growing in Australia to continue, it will have to pay to farmers the cost of producing wheat, plus the basic wage at least, otherwise it will be impossible for the Government to give effect to its desire that all sections of the community shall enjoy a reasonable standard of living. Since the guaranteed price of 3s. l0d. a bushel was agreed to, war conditions have necessitated the storage of larger quantities of wheat than were expected to be held in Australia. Uncertainty as to the duration of the war make it impossible for any one to say what the storage charges will be, but I submit that the amount should be a charge on the whole community, and should not be a burden to be borne by the wheat-farmers alone. I hope that the Government will look into this matter immediately, and sec whether or not a better price cannot be assured to farmers for their wheat in the future. The minimum payment to them should be the cost of production, plus the basic wage.I urge the Government to pay immediately another 6d. a bushel on last season's crop, and also to wind up the earlier pools by giving to the producers the small amounts that arc still due to them. In these times primary producers cannot carry on without cash, but they have little or no cash. An advance of 2s. 4d. or 2s. 6d. a bushel for their wheal is a paltry payment which is altogether insufficient to cover their expenses.I know that the Minister for Commerce (Mr. Scully) is sympathetic to the claims of the farmers. The granting of my request may involve a considerable sum of money, but it is a payment which should be made immediately.

When the last call-up was made the men concerned received only two or three days' notice. The only people who are competent to judge whether or not a longer period is possible are the responsible officers of the department. In some instances as long as three months elapsed between the time when the men were advised that they were liable to be called up and the date of their going into camp.
