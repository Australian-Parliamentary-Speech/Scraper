Government Tramways and Electricity Supply before June, 1925. Application for free admission under Tariff item 174 was made on 27th September, 1923, and was refused on 13th November, 1923. The applicant stated that the amount of duty payable at the full rate of 27½ per cent. would be £20,000, approximately. 2.Similar machinery for the Morwell power scheme was admitted' under item 174. The orders for this machinery were placed at various dates prior to 10th October, 1921. Admission under item 174 was restricted to the portion of the plant which clearly could not have been manufactured in Australia at the time the orders were placed. A substantial proportion of the contract was manufactured in the Commonwealth. An application for similar admission of additional plant ordered later for the Morwell scheme was refused. The decision in the Western Australian case was due to the fact that work which could not have been undertaken in Australia in 1021 could hare been successfully carried out at the end of 1023, when the Western Australian application was under consideration, owing to the development of Australian industry in the meantime. Free admission would then have been detrimental to the engineering industry, and, consequently, inconsistent with the Protective policy expressed in the Tariff. 3.An electric lifting magnet was admitted into New South Wales under item 174 on 5th February, 1924. Before the by-law was approved it was clearly established that local manufacture was not' at the time practicable. In limiting admission to the one appliance, the object in view was to ascertain whether by using the appliance as a pattern, the. manufacture of future requirements could be undertaken in the Commonwealth. The restriction would not prejudice any other request for similar admission provided the necessary conditions existed. 4.See reply to 1 and 2.

As honorable senators are aware, the bankruptcy laws of Australia arc embodied in six different State Acts, and the consolidation of our bankruptcy laws is one step towards unification, which in my opinion is the only solution of many of our present difficulties. This is a necessary measure, and if it becomes law should be of advantage to the citizens of the Commonwealth. Some honorable senators who have already spoken have explained how the different States Bankruptcy Acts operate, and as one who has always been a strong unificationist I shall do my best to assist in passing this measure if some amendments, which I consider necessary, are adopted. Our bankruptcy laws are very intricate, and in their present form have proved injurious to many people. The Government through the Crown Law Department have very carefully perused the different State Acts and have embodied in this Bill provisions which if they become law will give satisfaction to the people of the Commonwealth. It is a lengthy measure of 222 clauses. After it has been amended in Committee in the way we desire, it is probable that it will meet with the fate of similar measures which have previously been submitted, and another Bill of the same type will be brought down when the Government have no other business to place before the Senate. If on this occasion the Government really wish to place this measure on the statute-book theywill receive assistance from every conscientious member of this Parliament who. desires to do his best to assist Australia in securing self-government in the fullest sense. I doubt sometimes if we are a self-governing dominion, because at times a few men overseas gather together and demand that certain laws shall be passed to suit their commercial interests. Sir Josiah Symon and ex-Senator Keating have in the past delivered excellent speeches on our bankruptcy laws, and I believe we have with us now legal men of equal ability who will assist us in improving this Bill. The measure embodies certain amendments of the existing State laws which should be of advantage in dealing with bankrupt estates, particularly that which makes it compulsory that all estates valued at £300 and under shall be administered officially. Some honorable senators may not agree with the proposal, and may suggest that if a man becomes bankrupt, then whatever his assets or liabilities may be, he should be allowed the same privileges as are enjoyed by others. If a man wishes his estate administered as quickly and as economically as possible the officials will have the opportunity to adjudicate, and I believe that will be of benefit to the poorer people when adversity . compels them to seek the aid of the Bankruptcy C our t. Many good men have been compelled through stress of circumstances to seek the aid of the C our t, but. in after years have been able to pay off every penny of their liabilities. If this is possible it will save time and the cost of administering the bankrupt estate. The experience in England is that the saving effected by official administration as compared with non-official administration is as high as 50 per cent. That is to say, if the administration under the C our t through a non-official administrator would cost £10, officialdom would carry out the task for £5. That, indeed, would be a material saving to those unfortunate persons who are compelled to put their estates through the Bankruptcy C our t. The official trustees and assignees in insolvency do not like this proposal, but bankruptcy law is to a great extent a public matter. It has other aspects than that of getting the last farthing out of an insolvent for the sake of the creditors and the trustees or assignees. The public are concerned both as regards the creditor and the debtor, and if it were not for judicial and official control, commercial immorality and the greed of creditors and their hirelings would know no limits. They are only kept within bounds by the law, and a little more tightening up of official control should be salutary, and should have a good effect on those who, once they get an unfortunate debtor into the C our t, are only too ready to squeeze everything they can out of the estate for themselves, leaving as little as possible for the creditors and a very small balance indeed for the unfortunate individual who is obliged to seek their aid. I have not a trained legal mind, but in the past I have listened with pleasure in this Chamber to speeches on bankruptcy legislation by honorable senators with trained legal minds, although it is so long ago now that one can hardly remember what was said by them. I am satisfied that this measure has been carefully drawn, and that it will bring about uniformity, but I hope the Government will resist any attempt to introduce parochial amendments designed to bring the Bill into conformity with some of the State laws. We want a Commonwealth bankruptcy law, and not one that will perpetuate many of the existing State provisions that have caused so much trouble in the past. On many occasions men who should have been obliged to resort to the Insolvency C our t have been able to defeat the ends of justice by moving from one State to another. In Queensland, I understand, much of what is really bankruptcy business is outsidethe State Insolvency Act - a musty and ancient document.

They are in favour of official control, but they believe that they have invented a system of avoiding bankruptcy by leaving the creditors masters of the situation. I warn the Government to keep an eye on honorable senators representing South  Australia and Queensland, who will be on the alert to have their own State laws incorporated in this Bill, which, in my opinion, ought to be a pure-blooded Australian measure, giving satisfaction to all sections of the community. Oneor two clauses I hope will be amended, and when the Bill is in Committee I shall draw the attention of the Government to them. For instance, under clause 82 (e) a workman is given a preferential claim to £50 for wages. Some people would like to cut out that provision. I hope that the Government will stick to their guns, and even increase the amount. Under clause 89 (d) apprentices are allowed £20 for tools of trade. If those who framed the Bill years ago thought £20 was sufficient to cover the tools of trade of an apprentice, it is only fair that the amount should be doubled now that the cost of those tools has increased by about 100 per cent. The provisions of this Bill should be made as simple as possible, in order to cut down legal expenses. There should be fewer applications to a Judge, and more references, where possible, to registrars, instead of to judges. This is really a Committee Bill, and when we get to work on it I hope that our learned legal senators will take a greater interest in it than they have displayed in the past. I commend the Government again for resurrecting the bones of their grandfathers, so to speak, and setting their officials to work to reconstruct the Bankruptcy Bill, which session after session they bury and rake out again, to give the Senate some work to do. I trust that on this occasion they are in earnest, and that they intend to pass the Bankruptcy Bill this session. When they have done so, I am confident they will make a start on other laws in respect of which we need uniformity if Australia is to be the nation it should be. I have had no practical experience in Courts of law. I have never owed much, and I have always been able to collect, without much trouble, whatever has been owing to me. A man with a hefty punch is better than one who is always seeking the aid of the law. Those who administer the bankruptcy laws ought to aid the unfortunate citizen who has to seek his way through the Courts, but there are men who will not leave the carcass so long as there is any meat on it for themselves. There are many persons operating in this way to-day whom I would drum out of the country. Attempts are made too often to take advantage of the unfortunate industrialists, who are trying, by the preservation and fostering of our industries, to make Australia a good place in which to live. There are too many ' hangers on ' in the community. This wealthy section is able to erect palatial offices in every city of the Commonwealth, a-nd for all these premises tenants are found. With the exception of possibly one-tenth of their number, this section represents an economic loss to the country. Much ia said about the dearth of good mechanics. Senator Drake-Brockman is fond of talking about the bricklayers and the volume of work done by him in a day. I claim that the financial institutions do not care whether bricklayers lay 100 or 1,000 bricks in a day so long as they can spend the money they have extracted from the industrial community. That is a peculiar statement for me to make, but it is a correct one. The pawnbrokers and men of that class force the industrialists to seek the aid of the law to extricate them from their financial difficulties. I should like to take 90 per cent, of that class of people and sink them along with the Australia. I hope that the Government will proceed with the Bill, and that it will soon become law. It should represent the advance guard of many other constructive unified measures that are necessary in the interests of Australia. Under the Commonwealth Constitution this Parliament is given power to deal with certain matters, including laws relating to bankruptcy, but it has signally failed to discharge its obligation in this respect. It has similarly failed to legislate satisfactorily with regard to the marriage laws, and, if this important matter is not promptly attended to, an existing evil will leave its mark on the- Australian nation. I notice that the women of this country are more active in protesting on this account than the men, for they have formed associations in many of the capital cities for the purpose of fighting an evil that is causing much trouble in our national life. Hoping that the Bankruptcy Bill is but the forerunner of a number of other useful measures of a similar character, I shall do my part in expediting the passage of the Bill, believ ing it to be in the best interests of the community.

I am rather inclined to agree that that is so. and that it does not contain many principles suitable for discussion in a second-reading speech. Despite that opinion I had prepared, in the earlier portion of t hi s session, a speech of considerable length, but the delay that has occurred hi the consideration of the measure has given me an opportunity of t hi nking again about the matter, and. probably has saved the Senate from the misfortune of having to listen to a technical speech on a dry subject. Although I may make my main contribution to the debate in the Committee stage, there are a few general comments that I wish to offer. We draw our authority for dealing with t hi s matter from section 51 of the Commonwealth Constitution, w hi ch gives us power, amongst other t hi ngs, to make laws in respect to bankruptcy and insolvency. We have had that authority from the inception of Federation. T hi s is the t hi rd attempt that has been made by the Parliament to deal with bankruptcy, the Bills having been always initiated in the Senate. I sincerely hope that we shall make further headway t hi s time than on the two previous occasions. It is most desirable to have a uniform bankruptcy law for Australia. All the States have been expecting it for the last twenty -four years, and consequently no amendment of any importance has been made in the bankruptcy laws of the various States during that period. All the State bankruptcy laws, with the possible exception of the Victorian Act, are now very much out of date, and need revision. It happened that all the Statutes of the State of Victoria were revised in 1915, and, incidentally, the bankruptcy law of the State was revised in that year. In all the other States the matter has been most carefully left alone. The oldest Bankruptcy Act in Australia is, I t hi nk, that of Tasmania, w hi ch was passed in 1872, and the latest is the Victorian Act of 1915, w hi ch is really a repetition of an earlier Victorian law. The Queensland Act was passed as long ago as 1874.  ","Second Reading","BANKRUPTCY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

That Act was framed by, possibly, the best parliamentary draftsman Australia has ever had. I refer to the late Sir Samuel Griffith. At that time it was probably the best Bankruptcy Act in Australia. I admit that it was a good law in 1874. To-day, it is still a good law, but it needs amendment. We have had fifty years' experience in bankruptcy matters since it was brought into existence, and, during that time, there have been many judicial decisions with regard to that particular Act and to bankruptcy laws throughout Australia and the Empire generally. The present Bill purports to include the result of our experience extending over half a century, and of those judicial decisions. There is really no fundamental alteration in the law. The laws of bankruptcy throughout Australia are identical in principle. There is a slight variation in the sections, but there is no variation in the principles underlying those sections. Senator Thompson wishes us to retain the bankruptcy law of Queensland. Senator Benny, who is in love with the South Australian Act, because he knows it, is anxious to retain in this Bill the provisions of that measure. Letme mention, in passing, that Part XI. of the present Bill is practical!}' identical with the provisions cowering the same particular section of bankruptcy law in the South Australian Act. The latter measure was also drawn up a number of years ago - I think in 1886 - by a very able lawyer, Mr. Paris Nesbit. who certainly improved on the Queensland Act and other Acts that were then in force. They, in turn, have since been improved. We have in the Victorian law, dealing with compositions and deeds of arrangement, a slight improvement on the South Australian law, and there is also a slight variation of the law that exists in Great Britain. It has been recognised by the persons who conferred on the drawing of this Bill, that there is a lot of merit in the South Australian provisions that have been incorporated in this measure, and also in the corresponding provisions of the British Act, and, I think, the Victorian Act.

There are some provisions with which I differ, and I shall endeavour to induce the Government to improve on them; but, generally speaking, I think the Bill should be accepted by the Senate and adopted as quickly as possible, so that we may have a uniform bankruptcy law for the whole of Australia. I hope that we shall cease to hear of Queensland and South Australia's bankruptcy laws, and that in future we shall have an Australian bankruptcy law.

He read to the Senate several very long documents that had been prepared by interested parties in Queensland.  Senate Thompson. - They are very able men. Undoubtedly, because they put up a very able case. Senator Thompson asked the Senate to accept the opinions of Mr. Joseph Kenna and Mr. Thomas E. White, two very - interested men from Queensland. His argument was that we should retaincertain provisions of the Queensland Act and scrap -some of the most important provisions of this particular Bill. After Senator Thompson made his onslaught on this Bill last year, I prepared a memorandum which I have now before me, but I have not had an opportunity of looking at it since. I have, however, a recollection of the main points of Senator Thompson 's speech and the documents that he read. I have reduced them, and also my answers, to a small compass, and shall place them shortly before the Senate. His first complaint was that this Bill withdraws the control of the estate from the persons most interested, namely, the creditors. He then elaborated at considerable length - or Mr. Kenna or Mr. White, or both of them, did - his complaint, which really resolved itself into two points. The first is that liquidation by arrangement under the Queensland Act finds no equally effective provisions in this Bill. The second point is that private deeds of arrangement are brought within the scope of the Bill. In Queensland, private deeds of arrangement are dealt with outside the scope and without the control of the Bankruptcy Courts and bankruptcy officials. This Bill provides that all bankruptcy matters, whether deeds of arrangement, deeds of assignment, or sequestration, shall be under the control of the Court.

It is very desirable, in the interests of both the creditor and debtor, that the Bankruptcy Courts throughout Australia should have greater control over both debtors and creditors than that existing in Queensland. The Bill before the Senate contains special provisions for liquidation by arrangement, after adjudication of bankruptcy. This provision finds a place generally in State bankruptcy laws, but in the States where there are provisions for private deeds of arrangement it is almost obsolete. However, it is retained in this Bill, so that instead of the Bankruptcy Bill being administered by the Court, it may more effectively place the administration of the estate in the hands of creditors, who, if necessary, will be under the supervision and control of the Court itself. Senator Thompson's second complaint is that private deeds of arrangement are brought within the scope of the Bill. It will be remembered that the honorable senator frequently spoke about ' the respectable and honest assignee and trustee in insolvency.' He also stressed the fact that there were reasonable creditors and conscientious debtors. I suppose they exist, but there is another side of the case. There are the selfseeking creditor and the dishonest debtor, and we also have to take into consideration the rapacity of trustees and assignees. If I remember correctly, Senator Wilson, when introducing this Bill, anticipated Senator Thompson's comment in this regard, and dealt with this point quite effectively and fully. Consequently there is no occasion for me to answer further his comments regarding this particular phase of the bankruptcy law, or to deal with his request that this feature of the Queensland law should be incorporated in the Bill in place of the provisions which are there now. The next complaint he made, when dealing with the question of private deeds of arrangement, was that the Bill would greatly increase legal expenses. I do not agree with my honorable friend in that regard. I cannot see that there will be any increase in legal expenses in winding up an estate by deed of assignment under this Bill, as compared with the expenses incurred under the Queensland Act.

These people were assignees in bankruptcy, and presumably it paid them well to do all the legal work for a guinea, and probably they violated the Legal Practitioner's Act of Queensland in doing it. Nearly every man who deals with land transactions, and nearly every accountant, violates that Act every day in the week. I refuse to be a party to assisting them to violate it in future. When they tell us that they charge only a guinea, the chances are that they have no right to charge even that amount. The law that we are proposing to bring into force in Australia is virtually the same as that operating in England. If Senator Thompson would consult the bankruptcy statutes of England he would find that there is no complaint of delay, but that the provisions relating to private deeds of arrangement have encouraged this system in preference to straight-out bankruptcy. This is a state of things contemplated with uneasiness by some people as being against the upholding of mercantile morality, but regarded with satisfaction by trustees and assignees in insolvency. Another of my honorable friend's complaints is that the proposed Bill does not provide for the private examination of a bankrupt on oath by a trustee.

I suggest that as private deeds of arrangement are coming under strict official control, any necessity that previously existed for such a provision no longer operates.

He contends that for such a purpose a special jury is absolutely necessary.

He made a few introductory remarks, and then proceeded to read state- ments, which fill many pages in Hansard, of data supplied to him by two gentlemen named Kenna and White. His speech in this Chamber was a reading of those two long documents. Consequently I must deal with Mr. White and Mr. Kenna, rather than with Senator Thompson . If Senator Thompson had givenhis personal experiences and knowledge he might have made a better contribution to this debate than that which we heard from him.. Mr. White has a very good opinion of the average barrister in Queensland, but he blows somewhat hot and cold. Sometimes he is merciful to the unfortunate debtor, but when it comes to a private deed of arrangement, and ordinary bankruptcy, he argues that the bankrupt should be tried by a special jury in order to secure conviction. The Bill provides for a decided tightening up of penalties' and procedure with respect to fraudulent insolvency practice. It gives the Court very drastic powers to try summarily a bankrupt who is guilty of an offence punishable by imprisonment. Honorable senators will see, if they examine clause 216, that this is so. The clause reads -  1.If the Court, in any application foran order of discharge either voluntary or compulsory, has reason to believe that the bankrupt has been guilty of an offence against this Act punishable by imprisonment, it may - charge him with the offence and try him summarily; or commit him for trial before any Court of competent jurisdiction. 2.Where the Court tries the bankrupt summarily it shall servo him with a copy of the charge and appoint a day for him to answer it. On the day so appointed, the Court shall require the bankrupt to plead to the charge, and if the bankrupt admits the charge, or if after trial the Court finds that the bankrupt is guilty of the offence, the Court may sentence him to imprisonment for any period not exceeding six months. 3.Atthe summary trial, if the offence is not admitted, the Court may cause to be read to the bankrupt the evidence taken before the Court on which the charge is based, and that evidence shall thereupon be evidence in the trial: and the Court may take further evidence in support of the charge, and shall allow evidence and argument to be adduced on behalf of the bankrupt. 4.For the purpose of committing the bankrupt for trial, the Court shall have all the necessary powers as to taking depositions, binding over witnesses to appear, admitting the accused tobail, and otherwise.

Not only have we provision for trial by jury - bycommon jury, it is true - but also very drastic and new provisions for summary trial. Those provisions are certainly not in the Queensland Act, although I believe they are in the New South Wales, the Victorian, and the English Acts. When Senator Thompson joins with his friends Mr. White and Mr. Kenna in wails and expressions of regret in this regard, he is acting upon false premises. He also regrets that this Bill contemplates giving a monopoly of estates under £300 to the official trustees, and he contends that such a provision is manifestly unfair and undesirable. He said, ' The whole Bill is drafted with the effect, if not the intention, of enormously increasing the legal costs payable,' and -we have been told that in many cases the legal costs are only a guinea. I am not prepared to believe that Mr. White is an altruist. He probably Tuns his business in the interests of Mr. White . The same statement applies to Mr. Kenna , and, therefore, we need to accept their comments on this point with a certain amount of care. It may not be very desirable from their point of view that small estates should be dealt with by the Court; but the experience of Great Britain is that it is much more economical to have such estates wound up and dealt with by the Court and officials of the Court than by private trustees and accountants. The same experience applies to the small estates of deceased persons. In England they have had experience of dealing with these matters by the Court and by official trustees and private assignees and accountants. Their experience is that it costs less than half as much under the administration of the Court as under the other form of administration. The Bill provides that these small estates shall be administered by the Court instead of under the system operating in Queensland, which, although it is fifty years old, is still advocated by the Queensland gentlemen who are naturally very interested in it.

The bankruptcy referred back, not to the date of his becoming bankrupt, but to the date when he committed an act of bankruptcy. Although many of his transactions in property might have taken place between the date on which he committed an act of bankruptcy and the date on which he became bankrupt, the property, which had been sold, given away, or otherwise disposed of, was the property of the creditors, and could be recovered by them.

It is very hard to determine what is an act of bankruptcy, which makes the doctrine more difficult and more confusing in its application. There have been cases where a Court of original jurisdiction has ruled that a certain act was an act of bankruptcy. The Court of Appeal has disagreed, and the case has gone to the House of Lords, where some of the Lords have said that the act was an act of bankruptcy, and others have asserted that it was not. There is considerable difficulty in saying what is an act of bankruptcy even though we have it defined in the Bill. May I give an illustration of the doctrine of. relation back: On the 1st January, ' A ' commits an act of bankruptcy, and on the 1st February ' B ' buys a race-horse from 'A' for which he pays £100. On the 1st March ' A ' is made a bankrupt, and the horse has belonged to the trustees of ' A's ' estate since the 1st January. Consequently ' B,' the unfortunate purchaser of the horse, has to give up the animal to the trustees in ' A's ' bankruptcy. In short, that is an illustration of the doctrine of relation back. That is the effect of clause 88 which I mentioned and which is a copy of section 37 of the English Act. Probably no community would tolerate this provision unless it were restricted in some way. This clause has been restricted to a certain extent. For instance, it does not apply if ' B' purchased the horse bona fide and without notice of any act of bankruptcy or before the date of the sequestration order. In clause 94 of the Bill a certain amount of relief is provided. To return to the illustration, and in spite of these exceptions, if ' B ' knew that ' A ' had committed an act of bankruptcy, and while that act of bankruptcy still remained available, he incurs the risk of losing his right to prove in the bankrupt estate or to sue ' A.' The doctrine of relation back was dealt with by the Board of Trade, and its report was in the following terms : -  ","Second Reading","BANKRUPTCY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I could give further illustrations of the extraordinary results of this law, particularly as it affects bankers and solicitors, but I shall wait until the matter comes up for more particular discussion in Committee.I think the Bill should be accepted, and that it should be turned into an Act of the Australian Parliament as early as possible. We have delayed it too long, and I hope that on this occasion the Government are in earnest, and intend to put it though this session, so that it may not be among the slaughtered innocents, as it has been on several previous occasions. The Bill is long overdue. The bankruptcy laws of all the States badly need bringing up to date. Excellent as they have been found in the past, the Queensland law was enacted fifty year's ago and the South Australian law was passed in 1886. Much knowledge has been gained in these matters since these laws were enacted, and strong though the affection may be that Senators Thompson and Benny have for their respective State enactments, I hold that those laws, along with the rest of the Bankruptcy Acts of Australia, need to be overhauled, as they now are in the Bill before us, which I hope will become law at. an early date.

In various States there are provisions similar to those set out in the clause. After the meeting of creditors where the bankrupt has to be present and has to give all the information he can for the assistance of the creditors, he goes before the Court for his public examination on oath. The examination is conducted by the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy. Outside lawyers are not brought in unless some of the creditors wish to bring them in. But there is no occasion for their presence. The Official Receiver is a man specially trained in this class of work, and it is his business to examine the bankrupt, or the man who has called a meeting of his creditors. He conducts that examination in open Court and on oath,, and extracts the fullest information in regard to the debtors' affairs or assets. Everything that a private, star chamber examination could possibly extract would be obtained by the examination by the OfficialReceiver in Bankruptcy. The proceedings are open. Any person interested may attend. The creditors and the debtor are guaranteed protection, and the public are given the same security. The open nature of the proceedings assists in maintaining that high standard of commercial morality at which all bankruptcy laws should aim. The Committee should not accept Senator Thompson's amendment.

A bankrupt should not be in a worse position than a criminal, who, if accused of murder, can say to his accusers, ' You prove what is alleged against me.' Honorable senators opposite, like members of the legal profession, know how unjustly a poor insolvent is sometimes treated. The onus of proving the justice of his case is placed on him. It might be impossible to do that. 'We ought therefore, to protect the insolvent. Senator Thompson seeks to amend the clause so that there shall be an additional onus and strain upon the unfortunate debtor, who has all the world against him and is being crushed out of existence. The true principle of British justice is that it is not the debtor's duty to prove anything. That duty devolves on the creditors.

Knowing that he had a considerable sum of money to collect on draft through two banks in London, we made him insolvent and the official trustee cabled to London, and had these moneys stopped. When the debtor arrived there he had to cable for sufficient money for his immediate needs. The result was that the creditors received 20s. in the £, and heavy legal expenses.

I am not asking that this great battleship shall be used as a breakwater, or for any such purpose, as that would do more to destroy Australia 's pride in her than if she were sunk in deep water. The agitation for the saving of the Australia was started by me in Sydney last Christmas, largely in consequence of conversations I had had with people in that city. I saw the work of dismantling proceeding, and in travelling in trains, trams and on ferry boats, I found the matter was of great interest to the people of that city. I endeavoured to obtain the opinions of as many people a* possible, and I did not meet a single individual who agreed with the sinking of the ship. When the vessels of the Special Service Squadron visited South Australia I discussed the matter with officers, petty officers and men, and in every instance I heard strong expressions of disapproval concerning the Government's proposal. I also wrote to the newspapers in Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, and had the satisfaction of seeing in several prominent daily newspapers published in the capital cities leading articles in support of my suggestion. The action I am now taking must not be regarded as being in any sense a reflection upon the Government, who are, I believe, of the opinion that the Australia must be destroyed, in order to comply with the terms of the Washington Treaty. I have always held that under the terms of that treaty we are not compelled to sink the Australia , and I have submitted this motion to draw attention to the fact that the Government are acting contrary to the wishes of the great bulk of the Australia n people. It is the duty of the Government to see if effect cannot be given to the decisions of the Washington Conference iu the manner I suggest. It was proposed to sink the Australia on Anzac Day. It is astounding that there should have been any thought of selecting for this purpose the day on which Australia solemnly commemorates the great achievements of her men on Gallipoli. Under the terms of the Treaty the vessel has been dismantled, and as she is practically obsolete, is .quite worthless for warlike purposes. I have been informed that the contractor who is dismantling the vessel has made quite a large sum of money from the sale of small portions of the fittings which have been purchased as trophies. If such is the case, I deplore it, because such trophies should be the property of the Australia n people as a whole, and should not be disposed of by any individual for the purpose of gain. I have received large numbers of letters from all parts of Australia , some from as far west as Derby in Western Australia , and others from Townsville in the east of Queensland, all of which support the proposal I have suggested. In addition, I have received many communications from South Australia , and there is one in particular of which I think a good deal. It is submitted in the form of a petition from the workmen at the Government workshops at Glanville. It is worth quoting -  ","N/A","H.M.A.S.

Some time ago the Lord Mayor of Adelaide called a meeting of citizens to protest against the sinking of the Australia . That gentleman, who is also president of the Navy League in- South Australia , has always taken a keen interest in this question, and is very much opposed to the Government proposal. At the meeting of citizens convened by the Lord Mayor, two motions opposing the sinking of the Australia were carried, and were forwarded to the then Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page), who, I understand, handed them to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Bowden). From that day to this no reply or acknowledgment has been received by the Lord Mayor of Adelaide to the protest he forwarded on behalf of representative citizens. Such treatment on the part of either the Acting Prime .Minister or the Minister for Defence was most ungenerous. The Minister for Defence, when passing through Adelaide on his way to Western Australia to meet the Prime Minister, gave an interview to press representatives in Adelaide, when some of the objections raised concerning the sinking were answered, but the Lord Mayor of Adelaide, who called the meeting of citizens, i3 entitled to greater courtesy. The Minister for Defence, in statements made from time to time, has indicated that vessels of the Special Service Squadron will be present when the Australia is sunk. I have spoken to a large number of men employed on vessels of the Fleet, and have ascertained that not one is anxious to take any part whatever in the ceremony. The men of the Special Service Squadron realize that the Australia is the first battleship we have had, and that owing to the changes which are taking place in naval warfare she may be the last. The Australia should be to the Australia n people what Nelson's Victory is to the people of England. I believe the Americans also have their ship, the Success, which has been preserved by the people of the United States of America just as the Victory has been by the people of Great Britain. Why should we not pay as much respect to the Australia as the people of Great Britain and America pay to their historic vessels? We know what England owes to the men of her Navy, and that the Australia n people also have great respect for those who man the vessels of the Australia n Fleet. We have not the same traditions as the people of England, but our Navy has rendered great service, and the people of Australia have every right to be proud of it. I want to know why the Australia should be sunk, and of course I shall be told, that it has to be sunk, because of the provisions of the Washington Treaty. 1 shall not take up time by reading largely from that Treaty, but certain of its provisions dealing with the scrapping of ships of war justify me in declaring that there is no need for haste so far as the sinking of the Australia is concerned, and that it need not take place for at least another twelve months.

It is intended, I believe, to sink the vessel while the British Fleet is in Sydney, but it makes no difference so far as the Treaty is concerned, whether it takes place then or not. I see no reason why action should not be postponed' until the Government have obtained reports from ship-building experts upon the practicability of the suggestions I have made. My proposal is that the sides of the vessel should be cut down almost to the water's edge in order to provide ingress and egress and to admit light and air to the interior, and that the decks should be similarly treated. Sections should be removed, and glass gratings substituted, in order to allow light to penetrate into the interior. I would not take her away from Sydney Harbor. The vessel could then be moored somewhere near Tooronga Park, where I believe, 80 per cent, of the people visiting the Zoological Gardens would inspect her. A charge could be made for admission and in a very little while the revenue derived from that source could pay all costs of maintenance. If treated in that way the Australia would occupy in the Commonwealth the position that the Victory does in Great Britain. I do not know that any charge is made for inspecting the Victory , but I am confident that nearly every Australia n who visits England makes a point of inspecting her where she now lies anchored at Chatham. I am quite sure the people of the Commonwealth in years to come would be as keen to see the Australia as the people of Great Brtiain and the Dominions are to see the old Victory . The letters which I have received contain many suggestions as to the use that might be made of the Australia . Some persons think .that she should be used as a breakwater; others would turn her into a bridge; others again think that she might be used as a hospital. I am not particular as to what use the Government make of the vessel so long as she is kept afloat. In the early stages of the agitation, one genius suggested that the vessel should be sunk off Bondi on the day of the surf carnival. The individual who would suggest that the Australia should be butchered to make a Bondi holiday could not have a very big soul. The people of the Commonwealth have spent large sums of money in erecting monuments to fallen soldiers. There is scarcely a town or hamlet in Australia which has not a monument to the memory of the gallant men who went overseas to fight for us. Our capital cities are vieing with each other in the amount of money they propose to spend on war memorials. Melbourne is about to spend £250,000 on a great monumental edifice. I do not know what Sydney intends to do, but I am sure its expenditure will be greater than that of Melbourne. Adelaide is content to spend a modest £25,000. I have no doubt that, in time, a very expensive and beautiful monument will be erected at Canberra, I approve of every proposal to devote money to this purpose. We cannot do too much in commemorating the splendid deeds of our men who went overseas and fought for us, but we cannot get away from the fact that, although names of sailors have been associated with those of soldiers on the memorials erected, they are land memorials, and almost entirely commemorate the deeds of soldiers. We want, at least, one memorial to preserve the memory of our seamen who did so much during the war to save the Commonwealth. We do not know what may happen in the future; we do not know what number of men we may require to man our future Navy; but, if the Australia is sunk, Australia n sentiment will also sink, so far as the young men of the future, to whom we must look to man our fleet, are concerned. I deplore more than anything else the fact that, if this ship which has served Australia so well is sunk, it will have a very bad effect on the national sentiment of the young men of Australia . I shall quote one or two statements by prominent men to show, that the people have been led, intentionally or unintentionally, to believe that the Australia would not be sunk.

In the face of a resolution of the Senate I do not think they will dare to do so until something further is done with the object of saving the vessel. However, it is not sufficient for the Government to know what is to be done. The people who are taking such a keen interest in this matter should also know what the Government intend to do. The Victory was built about 160 years ago, and is more popular to-day than she was in the days of her active service in the wars of Great Britain. Apart from the 'risks of war, storm, and shipwreck, it was only sheer luck that the vessel was preserved for the' nation. She was, upon completion, to be the largest vessel afloat, and enemy nations, who were rather jealous of her anticipated strength, sought to destroy her. France sent over an emissary to set her on fire while she still lay on the stocks, and, later on, an American gentleman, known to history as Jack the Painter, was hanged for a similar attempt. On several occasions the Victory had narrow escapes from destruction by' similar means, but her closest call was when the Lords of the Admiralty took . a hand in attempting t,o destroy her. We read that about 126 years, ago they ordered the Victory to bo dismantled and turned into a prison hulks Thirty years afterwards another proposal was made that the ship should be broken up, but a newspaper agitation prevented its .destruction. History records that on another occasion the First Lord of the Admiralty had boasted at a party that he had that day signed the death warrant of the Victory . A lady, who happened .to overhear the remark, took the matter up,' with the result that again the vessel was saved from t he fate that had threatened it. At present the desire of the Admiralty and oi' the people of England is all in the direction of saving the ship to the nation, and, so long as human ingenuity can keep the Victory afloat, it will be preserved. Only a few days ago we read in the newspapers that at Tokio a group of Japanese had asked the American Ambassador there to .use his influence at Washington to save from destruction the battleship Mikasa , which was Admiral Togo's flagship in the Russo-Japanese war. The Ambassador pointed out that the. United States of America was only one 'of the signatories to the Treaty, but he was prepared to forward the petition, to the State Department. The petitioners declared that they would present the request to the .other signatory Powers. Admiral Togo himself is reported to have said, ' We must conform to the Treaty, but we would like to see the Mikasa preserved, although she is useless, and was seriously damaged during the earthquake.' There was no earthquake at Garden Island, but any one looking today .at the Australia in course of being dismantled could not doubt its doom .unless immediate, .action is taken to save it. Are the people of Australia not as loyal to their country and to the fine traditions of their sailoi'3 and soldiers as are the Japanese? I feel confident that this Parliament and the people of Australia will refuse to sanction the destruction of this fine old ship. I have not submitted the present motion because of any whim of my own. I certainly originated the proposal, and I am delighted to know that it lias been supported in a most encouraging manner. 'The Government will surely listen to the voice of the community. They have no right to trample upon the sentiments of the people. I have received innumerable letters from all parts of Australia commending the motion,' and some of them are couched in very strong terms.

I should be very sorry if the motion were to be treated as a test of those who think well of the Australia n Navy. I regret to hear from the honorable senator that to a letter sent by the Lord Mayor of Adelaide to the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) no reply was- received.* I am afraid that there has been an oversight, and no one will regret it more than will the Acting Prime Minister. Whilst we must all admire Senator Newland for the sentiment that has prompted him to move this- motion, we must not take an action which would be viewed quite differently outside Australia . Looked at from inside Australia , Senator Newland 's motives and sentiments may be unchallengeable, but, unfortunately, we, as a Senate,. having ratified the Washington Treaty,' have to look at this question from not only a purely sentimental point of view, but also the view-point of the other signatories to the Treaty. I invite honorable senators to pay close attention to the motion moved by the honorable senator. It not only contains condemnation of the Government for proposing to sink the H.M.A.S. Australia , but suggests that the vessel should be altered by having such portions of her side and deck platings removed as would render her completely and permanently unfit for further war service; glass to be substituted for the plating so removed. To comply with the motion, the bottom plating as well as the side plating would have to be removed and glass substituted. I myself have seen in the South Pacific a small boat with a glass bottom, but it was merely a rowing boat. I have grave doubt whether a vessel of the tonnage of the Australia , with glass sides and bottom, can be made to float; yet, if we comply with the motion, that is what will have to be done. And then it is proposed that the ship shall be fitted throughout as a war memorial institute so that war trophies, pictures, and records may be preserved in her, and made available for public inspection. I am afraid that honorable senators supporting the motion have never seen the Australia . Certainly they have never seen her interior, otherwise this suggestion would not have been made. A more unsuitable ship for a memorial institute could not be imagined. As a battleship she is simply a mass of metal, both inside and outside. She is so constructed in order to stand the tremendous strain of her powerful engines and the great weight of armaments. Then there is a suggestion that the salving of the Australia for the purposes indicatedis on a parity with the salving of the Victory . First of all, the Victory was not included in any disarmament treaty. The nation had a free hand in her disposal, and the Victory was preserved as she was in Nelson's time, with masts and spars standing. The Australia , to-day, is a mere hulk, without funnels, masts or turrets, and any one looking at her would need a powerful imagination to say, ' That is the ship that defended our coast during the war.'  She is simply an unsightly hulk, whereas the Victory looks to-day as she did in Nelson's time. Senator Newland stated that he commenced this agitation after the demolition of the vessel had been entered upon. I suggest that he commenced his agitation too late. It should have been commenced before this Parliament ratified the Washington Treaty, because that was the only time when this resolution could have had any effect, unless we intended to disregard the Treaty, or to seek its alteration. It would be equally an infraction of the treaty to use the vessel as a breakwater. This could not be done without consulting the other Powers who were parties to the treaty. Something has been said concerning the sentiment of our sailors. I understand that the opinions of a large number of naval officers, some of whom served in the Australia, have been obtained, and they would infinitely prefer to see her sunk off the coast that she did so much to defend - flying her flag, that was never struck in the face of the enemy - rather than thatshe should be broken up under the terms of the treaty. There are only two ways by which we can comply with the treaty. One is to sink her, and the other is to breakher up. I venture to say that to sink the Australia-, with her flag flying, in the presence of her sister ships, is a far greater appeal to our sentiment than to send her to the breaking-up yard, just as one might send an old horse to the Zoo. I said just now that the motion, if passed, would have no effect unless the treaty were amended. I am afraid that Senator Newland has not read very closely the articles of the Washington Treaty dealing with the breaking up of H.M.A.S.Australia. Chapter 2 of the report sets out the vessels that may be retained. Part 2of that chapter reads as follows : - ","N/A","H.M.A.S.

This shall always involve the destruction or removal of all machinery, boilers, and armour, and all deck, side, and bottom plating. Converting the vessel to target use exclusively. In such case all the provisions of paragraph III. of this Part, except sub-paragraph (6) in so far as may be necessary to enable the ship to be used us a mobile target, and except subparagraph (7), must be previously complied with.

Of the capital ships' which would otherwise be scrapped under the present treaty in or after the year 1931 ... I nee d not rea d further, because, obviously, paragraph d d oes not apply to the Australia, but to other ships. There are two alternatives, each of them involving the complete d estruction of the ship. The treaty aims at nothing less, an d will be satisfie d with nothing less. Therefore, the Commonwealth Government has no choice, as each alternative involves the d estruction of the vessel. The Washington Treaty, as I have rea d , is man d atory that we must carry out the proce d ure of d estruction.

Senator Greene said, of course, that there was no intention of sinking the Australia. In accordance with the terms of the Treaty, the Government had two alternatives. It might have decided' to break up the ship. As a matter of fact, the breaking up of the ship was considered as an alternative to sinking her. Expert advice was obtained regarding the cost and feasibility of it, and the advice was such that the Government decided that to break it up would be uneconomical, and doubts were expressed whether it could be effectively done within the Commonwealth. Our ship-yards have not been equipped for that class of work, and it was quite on the cards that we would have had to send her to the United Kingdom to get her broken up. Even Great Britain has found it impracticable to break up many of the ships condemned under the Treaty, and has had to sink them. With all her dockyard equipment she has been unable to comply with the terms of the Treaty to that extent. I invite honorable senators to read the Treaty, and if they do so they will find that the Senate would stultify itself by passing the motion. I appeal to Senator Newland not to press the motion. It would not be fair to the Senate for him to do so. We cannot ratify a Treaty and then come along later with a proposal to evade its provisions. The honorable senator has made an appeal on the grounds of sentiment. I would be the last, and certainly ought to be the last, in this Senate to do anything to decrease the sentiment in favour of an Australian  Navy. I would not like any vote or speech of mine to be construed in that way. To pass the motion is not the way to do a service to the Navy, and to press it will hardly be fair to those honorable senators who do not want to be placed in the position of having to vote against it. The honorable senator has said that if the motion is passed the Government will not dare to proceed with the sinking of the ship. It is equally certain that the Government could not adopt the course suggested in the motion. If the Government accepted the motion as a direction not to sink the ship, it would have only one alternative, and that would be to break her up. It must do one thing or the other. Because of the expenditure involved, and also after full consideration of the sentimental aspect, it came to the conclusion that it would be too costly, and probably impracticable, to break her up in compliance with the terms of the Treaty. The Government believes that it would be best, both from the point of view of economy and sentiment, to sink the ship in the manner suggested. I appeal to Senator Newland to withdraw the motion. At the same time, I emphasize the fact that the rejection of it by the Senate cannot be interpreted as a lack of sentiment in favour of an Australia n Navy. The rejection of the motion will be a recognition that we have given our word of honour to carry out the terms of the Treaty strictly in the spirit and the letter. Let me say a few words about national sentiment. Senator Guthrie has said that it would be economically unsound to sink this ship, and he has appealed to the Senate on the score of sentiment. I remember that after the Great War we were faced with the problem of what to do with the horses then in Palestine. It would have been economically unsound, and extremely dangerous, because of the possibility of introducing to Australia diseases unknown here,to bring them back to this country, and so it was decided to follow the economically sound course of selling them in Egypt. What happened? Large numbers of the Light Horse men shot their horses - the horses that had carried them right through the campaign - rather than that they should be sold in the knackers' yards, or to strangers who would use them for various purposes. The sentiment behind that act was the same as that behind the sinking of the Australia . It is a sound sentiment. It may not be economical, but it is a sentiment that we can honour. By sinking the Australia we shall be expressing the true sentiment of the Australia n nation. The ship will go down with her flag flying - the flag which has never been struck in the sight of an enemy. She will sink, to repose on the bed of the ocean near the country that she has served so well, and we shall have complied with the terms of the Treaty. No one who looks at sentiment in its true light can find any fault with that proposition. Motion (by Senator Needham) pro- posed - ","N/A","H.M.A.S.

I have never suggested that the bottom plates should be removed, for I realize the difficulty of carrying out such an operation in Australia . The Minister said that the people of Great Britain saved the Vic- tory because she looked as she did in the days of her strength and glory. That, to some extent, is true, and it is also true that the Australia will look much as she did in the days of her strength and glory if what I suggest is done. That is not an argument against my motion. The Minister also suggested that I had not read the Treaty carefully. I have read it dozens of times since I started this agitation. I have read it with people who are expected to understand such matters, and they are agreed that if my motion was acted upon the terms of the Treaty in this respect would be carried out to the satisfaction of the. other Powers who are parties to it. J do not desire it to be assumed that the rejection of my motion will indicate a lack of sentiment on the part of those who vote against it. Some are opposing my suggestion from a strict sense of duty, and consider that the Government are carrying out the spirit and letter of the treaty. I differ from the contentions of the Minister, and believe that if my motion were carried, the provisions of the 'treaty would be complied with. The Minister referred to the horses which were destroyed by their riders rather than that they should be sold in Egypt. There is a wide difference between the destruction of horses on the desert of Egypt and the sinking of the Australia . Horses can easily be replaced, and the sentiment in such cases would be only that of a rider for his horse, whereas in this instance the whole of the Australia n people are involved. If the Government delayed the sinking of the Australia , they could obtain reports from ship-building experts to see what could be done. I believe I drew a comparison between the cost of equipping the Australia in the manner suggested, and that of building the numerous war memorials erected to our fallen soldiers. The cost of re-fitting the Australia as a war museum would not be great, and the sentiment of the Australia n people would be respected. In view of the stand I have taken, I shall not withdraw the motion, and I trust that it will receive the support of the majority of honorable Senators.  Question resolved in the negative.

I received what I considered a somewhat flippant answer - I was again asked to give notice of the question. This is a matter in which I have been interested for a considerable time, and it appears that a great deal of humbugging is being indulged in by some one.
