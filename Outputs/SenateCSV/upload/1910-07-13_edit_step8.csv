"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","22","O'KEEFE, David","JZ9","N/A","N/A","N/A","288","W - What was done has been fully explained by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and by the Prime Minister in another place, and it is clear that no matter what had been done, it would have had to be done without parliamentary authority in the special circumstances. I cannot see that the Government have been guilty of any heinous crime in the nature of financial or political dishonesty in using the trust funds as they did. After all the money belonged to the public; it was merely used to get over a temporary difficulty; nothing dishonest occurred, and I feel sure that even the members of the Opposition do not feel so strongly about the subject as their language would lead one to suppose. Regarding the financial policy of the last Administration, which was the subject of a referendum on the 13th April, it seems rather strange that although all the States returned to the Senate representatives pledged to the Labour platform:, nevertheless a considerable majority of the people in some of the States voted in favour of the Financial Agreement. That I say is a peculiar state of affairs. The explanation seems to me to be this. The people were opposed to the incorporation of the Financial Agreement in the Constitution. Consequently those who advocated so strenuously the embodying of it in the Constitution in opposition to what was regarded as the truly national policy were relegated to that political obscurity which I had the honour to adorn for three years. In my own State a considerable majority of electors voted for the agreement because, as I interpret the result, there was a loose kind of feeling that from the point of view of the amount to be paid it would be a good thing for Tasmania. But, nevertheless, the people voted for those candidates who were most strongly opposed to the agreement, because they did not want it to be embodied in the Constitution. What they wanted was to secure that the States should receive 25s. per head for ten years, and they were quite satisfied to trust the Federal Parliament in the future to see that justice was done. One of the most remarkable features of that attempt to handcuff the Federation is this : Ten years ago the leading statesmen and authorities on finance in Australia met together in a Convention, and framed the financial provisions of the Constitution. One of those provisions distinctly prescribed how the Federal revenue was to be divided for ten years. The leading statesmen in Australia at that time were quite prepared to trust the people and the Federal Parliament at the end of the ten years' period. Yet the Fusion party, in the last Parliament, endeavoured to foist the Financial Agreement upon the people, and were not willing to trust the Federal Parliament ten years hence. I consider that ten years is sufficiently long for the 25s. provision to endure, and Parliament should have an opportunity of reconsidering the matter at the end of that time. In relation to the financial proposals of the present Government, there is one matter which deeply affects the State that I have the honour to represent. While I recognise the propriety of what seems to be a very generous provision indeed regarding Western Australia - and it does seem a most generous provision for the Federation to make-  ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

As was said by a member of another place, Tasmania is now almost a suburb of Victoria, as regards its manufacturing industries. Take the boot trade. Before Federation there were 332 persons employed in that trade in Tas- mania. To-day the number has been reduced to 252, in spite of the natural increase of population. In other branches of manufacture, the same tale has to be told.

I wish to look at these matters in a national light, and hope that I shall always do so while I am here. I want honorable senators representing other States, however, to look at it in the same light. Because Tasmanians have been good Federalists, they have suffered financially. They have been in the habit of purchasing goods manufactured in other States, and also the products of those States, in preference to purchasing manufactured goods and products from over-sea. Had those manufactures and goods been purchased from abroad, Tasmania would have collected Customs duties upon them. But she has not done so, and, consequently, has suffered financially.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","38","O'KEEFE, David","JZ9","N/A","N/A","N/A","289","Tha That is not the question. The fact remains that every month a large number of persons come from Tasmania to Melbourne, not for the purpose of holiday-making, but in order to transact business. They have been doing this for years. I quite recognise that, in the light of the figures which have been supplied, and in view of the small per capita contribution which Tasmanians make to the revenue, that State will not be under any disability if, in the future, 25s. per head be returned to it by the Commonwealth. But we must recollect that figures can be made to prove almost anything. T repeat that a great many persons come from Tasmania to Victoria and purchase goods for which they do not trouble to take out Inter-State certificates. Thus, the State which I represent has lost considerable sums. The Government Statistician of Tasmania has pointed out that it has lost, approximately, ^40,000 annually by way of leakage in this connexion, and Sir William Lyne himself admitted in an interview in that State that it had lost at least £20,000 per annum. How does this leakage occur? I will give an illustration. Not very long ago, a Tasmanian friend of mine visited Melbourne, where he purchased a Cashmore gun for £26 10s., for which he paid cash. Speaking from memory, J think that the duty upon guns is something like 25 per cent. The weapon in question wa's manufactured outside of Australia, and the duty upon it, which was due to Tasmania, was therefore £5 or £6 But that State was not credited with the duty in question. Why? Simply because the purchaser did not know that he ought to have obtained an Inter-State certificate. The' ordinary purchaser from Tasmania does not stop to think about Inter-State certificates. If he purchases £100 worth of goods, which are dutiable at 20 per cent., when they are imported into Victoria, and which, therefore, ought to yield Tasmania a revenue of;£2o, he does not pause to worry about obtaining Inter-State certificates. Of course, a merchant who is doing a big business with Tasmania would do so. But the casual purchasers from Tasmania, who number thousands a year, do not. It will be seen, therefore, that, whilst the bookkeeping system has been in operation, the State from which I come has lost, approximately, ^40,000 a year.

With respect to the much-discussed and much-abused land tax proposal, I have only to say that I am whole-heartedly in favour of it, because no one has had a better opportunity than I have recently had in travelling through Tasmania of knowing the disastrous effects of land monopoly in that State. Without labouring the question, I believe that the imposition of the proposed land tax will do something to break up land monopoly; and, if it will not, let our opponents suggest a better scheme for the purpose, and they will find us willing to accept it. Until a better scheme has been suggested, we must go on with that which we have proposed. I must express my disappointment that the Government have not included in their immediate financial proposals one for the consolidation of the State debts, and to provide that future borrowing by the State- Parliaments shall be done only through the Federation. We must give the Government time, however; and I hope that, not later than next year, something in that direction will be done. We must have the consent of the people of the States before State borrowing can be controlled by the Commonwealth authority; but I think it would be financial suicide for the Federation to take over existing State debts before this Parliament has acquired the right to control future State borrowing. When the Government are submitting certain questions to the people by way of referendum next year, I trust that they will be asked to give the Commonwealth Parliament this power. One question which we are told is to be brought before the Senate is that of quarantine; and I hope that when the Government bring down their measure dealing with the subject it will be found to propose a radical alteration of the present quarantine laws in operation in Australia. I trust that it will take from the State Governments and hand over to the Federal authority all the quarantine powers now exercised by the various State Governments, and will give the Federal authority absolute control of all produce passing from State to State. Hundreds of people in the State from which I come were only a few months ago faced with' die prospect of black and bitter ruin as the result of the operation of the very unfair quarantine laws existing in some of the States. I can quote an instance that actually happened. A certain shipment of potatoes was passed by the Tasmanian inspector on the wharf at Devonport. It was sent to another State, where it was reported as unsound by the inspector of that State. It was shipped back to Tasmania, and without any picking over the potatoes were spilled from the bags in which they were contained into clean bags, and then returned to the port at which they had been condemned, and the same inspector passed them.

It will be remembered that the Electoral Bill of 1901, which was originated here, provided that' the senators should be elected under what was known as the Hare-Clark, or proportional, system, of voting. It was shown that it would be a cumbrous system to work in the big States, but I was always in favour of its adoption. When the provision was deleted, it was replaced with an optional system of voting. The Government brought down a clause providing that a man should be allowed to vote for one, two, or three candidates, as he chose, and should not be compelled to vote for the three candidates. That was put in in place of the original provision, but it was knocked out. I remember that, by interjection, if not by speech, some honorable senators who sat on the Opposition side, and, it may be, some senators who were in favour of the Barton Government, said they believed in that system which would allow a slight majority of the electors in a State to have the whole of its representation.

I have been one of those who have strongly desired to see that -result achieved. It stands to reason that each party will occasionally have an innings, lt has now come to the turn of my honorable friends on the other side to have an innings, and, in existing circumstances, I do not grudge it to them.. My impression is that responsibility is good for us all, and when we are in a responsible position some things are not so easy to manage as they seemed when we were merely spectators. I desire to compliment my friends, Senators McGregor, Pearce, and Findley, upon the positions which they occupy. I am sure that we all regret that Senator Pearce's state of health necessitates his absence. The sooner he comes back the better pleased we shall be. I believe that we have never had a more competent Minister of Defence than the honorable senator since the Federation took place. Of course, it is not unreasonable to suppose that, as the Ministry have a large majority, they will be in a position to allow, occasionally, a private senator to have the chance of bringing in a Bill. In days gone by it has been very difficult for a private senator to get a Bill passed through the Senate. I also desire to congratulate the proposer and seconder of the Address-in-Reply. I am glad to see that my friend, Senator McDougall, stands out for the great importance of the clans commencing with the prefix Mac. He says that the Macs, hold their own very well, and even in the Senate we see how well they, do that. I agree with Senator Ready that it is very desirable that we should not have very long speeches. In days long past we used to credit the Labour party with being the best ' stone-wallers ' here. We cannot for a moment say that we are equal to them in that respect. Our duty rather is not to waste time, but to criticise, and endeavour, as far as we can, to improve the Bills as they come before us. Ai I am not very well this afternoon, I do not propose to occupy much time. The Governor-General's Speech is composed of thirty paragraphs. It would be rather tedious to go through each paragraph, but the sixth one refers to a matter on which I desire to say a few words. It speaks of the payment of 25s. per head to the States commencing from the 1st July. I am not aware that the Braddon section of the Constitution has been altered. It provides that for ten years the States shall receive three-fourths of the net income from Customs and Excise duties. I maintain that the States are now entitled to receive that proportion until the 31st December next, and that, therefore, the proposed payment of 25s. per head can only commence legally on the 1st January, 191 1.

The Braddon section is still in force, and the States are undoubtedly entitled to receive three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. I draw the attention of new senators to the fact that this is essentially a States House, and we are bound to stand up for the rights of the States under the Constitution. Reference has also been made to the fact that the proposed Financial Agreement provided that the States would give £600,000 towards an estimated deficiency of £1,200,000 in the Commonwealth revenue. That promise was made on the condition that the provision for the payment of 25s. per head of the population was put in the Constitution. One part of the agreement not having been carried out, the other part need not necessarily be carried out. But if it is to be carried out in spirit, it should only cover one-half of the actual deficiency in the revenue. If the deficiency is £400,000, the States should be asked to pay half that amount. Many matters which are mentioned in the Speech will come before the Senate when Bills are introduced, and, therefore, I do not. propose to deal with them. I now come to the proposal for a Commonwealth note issue. That is a matter on which I think I can speak with a little knowledge. It is, perhaps, not known to many honorable senators that in days gone a certain Government had an idea of bringing in a note issue, and a meeting of bankers was held. I do not object to the principle of a Federal note issue, but I do maintain that if it is to be introduced, it should be as satisfactory to the every-day trader as the other note issue is. The heads of the banks met together and arranged that each bank should guarantee all the notes of the other banks, so that the public would have the joint and several guarantee of all the banks for every bank note, and the bank notes would be taken at par in any part of Australia.

It is proposed by the Government that with the Commonwealth note issue gold shall only be obtainable at the Treasury in Melbourne. At the present time the Queensland Government have six places within the State at whichGovernment notes can be converted into gold. I have that fact on the authority of the general manager of the Commercial Bank in Sydney, who gave me the information the last time I saw him. The Government will surely recognise that those of us who have to stand up for State Rights must insist that, if the Federal notes are only to be convertible into gold in one State of the Union, that will be unfair to the other States. Gold should be obtainable for the notes in each of the State capitals. Let me show what will happen if that be not done. A man can pay his debts in legal tender notes, and the creditor cannot refuse to receive them. But if he goes to buy goods, and proffers legal tender notes in payment', the seller is not obliged to accept that form of currency. Take the case of a man who holds Federal Government notes in Perth, and who goes to a banker, and says, ' I want to purchase a draft on London for £100.' Suppose that he offers notes in payment. The banker may, perhaps. consent to take them, but if he likes he may say, ' No; notes are not gold; if I take those notes I shall have to send them to Melbourne to get them cashed. Each of those notes is practically a Melbourne cheque. We shall have to charge you exchange on Melbourne.'

I think that the Government ought to have a Department to look after the note issue. There should be nonpolitical Commissioners, with probably bankers to assist them, in charge of the work. The Department should be conducted on business lines. The Commissioners should be able at any time to show their liabilities on one side and their assets on the other. If the Department were carried on at a profit, that profit should go into the general revenue of the Commonwealth. In that way we should have persons responsible for seeing that there was no undue issue of notes, and that there was an ample gold reserve.

The more places there are at which persons can get gold for the Federal notes the greater the favour with which they will be received by the public. If there are six places in the Commonwealth at which the notes can be converted, they will be regarded with more favour than if there is only one; and, again, if people know that they can get gold for their notes at any time, the probability is that they will not ask for it, because they will know that it is there. I have no objection to the principle of the Government controlling the note issue of the country, but we should see to it that the public are not penalized thereby. Take the Queensland system. In that State it is optional on the banks to pay a sovereign for every one-pound note they take. But if they prefer it, they need only pay one-third in gold and two-thirds in a fixed deposit for two years at 2 per cent. interest. That is one reason why the Government note issue in Queensland is looked upon favorably by the bankers of that State. I understand, however, that there is no intention to offer such facilities in the case of the Federal note issue. The consequence is that if the bankers have to retire all their notes, and then pay for £4,000,000 of notes introduced by the Federal Government, their facilities for lending money to the public will be less than they are to-day, and borrowers will be put to a disadvantage. I hope I have made that point clear. I also wish to make a few remarks with regard to the proposed progressive land tax. I gather that under the Constitution it is impossible to discriminate between town and country lands. How can a person having a large shop in town cut up that property so as to reduce the amount of his land tax?

At the present time in Papua, which is a very important and rising Territory of the Commonwealth, two banks, I am glad to say, have opened branches, to the great delight of the inhabitants, who recognise that banking does a vast amount of good. It is a legitimate occupation, and why should any one speak of bankers as if they were frauds? Why should banking be referred to as ' one of the frauds by which capitalism fleeces the people '? As a matter of fact, banking is one of the blessings; of our social system, and but for it this country would not have gone ahead as it has done. As an old banker, I am hereto stand up for the banking institutions of this country, and I contend that they have contributed in a very large degree to the prosperity of Australia. With regard to defence, I have on more than one occasion in the past said that I regard Senator Pearce as an admirable Minister. I am alf the better pleased that he is again, at the head of the Department, because he is apparently determined to act upon Lord' Kitchener's report. I also commend his action in determining to get Admiral Henderson to come and report on our situation/ from the naval point of view. I think the Minister of Defence deserves great credit. I am not one of those opponents who do not think that the present Government are capable of governing the country. I think they are quite capable. I am also glad that they intend to have one postage stamp for use throughout Australia. That is a very sensible proposal. There are several other matters in the programme of the Government as to which something might be said, but I prefer to wait until we see their measures. I observe that the Navigation Bill is to be resuscitated. I recognise, as I think we all do, that Senator Guthrie is probably the most competent man in this Chamber to deal with that matter, subject to Ministerial control. Would it not be a good thing to appoint Senator Guthrie , with one or two others, as a Committee to look through the Navigation Bill, and then accept their report upon it? It would take months to deal with the measure in the Senate. We always had it brought before us when we had nothing else to do.

The Prime Minister was pictured as holding the reins by which the creature was guided, the  Minister of Home Affairs sat immediately behind dressed in true American style, and the Attorney-General sat at the extreme rear looking a bit uncomfortable. The Minister of Home Affairs was credited with saying, ' What, brother, what are you afraid of? We are proceeding slowly, but all in good time.' Our friend the Minister of Home Affairs has been described as the most picturesque member of the present Administration. It seems to me that the present Government should be - as I think they will be - about the last to hesitate to carry the question of the Capital Site to a successful termination.

Four arrived by the steamer Tofua , of the U.S.S'. Co.'s line, and the balance by the A. U.S.N. Co.'s steamer Suva . Under the Alien Restriction Act the Chinese were not allowed to land on arrival, and the companies, although compelled to carry them as distressed seamen under the British law, found themselves responsible for their safekeeping. It so happened that the Tofua had to proceed to Newcastle for coal, and while there one of the Chinamen escaped from the vessel. Efforts have since been made to trace him, but without avail, and now the Customs authorities have notified the captain that he is liable to the extent of £100, and the fine will be inflicted unless the man is forthcoming. The Chinese oh the steamer Suva were also thrown on the hands of the ship's company that carried them from Fiji, and they have since been put to considerable expense to prevent them from landing pending arrangements for their departure from the Commonwealth.

To my mind, the tendency to give a preference to unionists is distinctly objectionable, and should be scouted by all moderate men. ' Fair play is bonnie play,' as they say in Scotland. Unfortunately, there will always be great differences in the financial position of individuals in this world. Some men will be rich, whilst others will be poor.

Though we heard ringing throughout the Commonwealth these prophecies and forebodings of disaster, we find that the remnant of the political parties opposed to us who have crept back to these chambers are apparently still as well satisfied with their financial and business position as they were. They do not seem to be fleeing the country. During a recent visit to Sydney, I noticed that the building trade there is booming quite as much as it has during the past two or three 5'ears, and none of the disastrous things that we were told would happen appear to have started to happen yet. However, it is of no use to flog a dead horse, and the other party is practically in that position to-day. I might express my great feeling of rejoicing at the fact that the Government are able to bring down a programme which, while it is not all that one might desire, is an instalment of many important reforms embodied in the Labour platform. I feel sure that if the greater part of the measures outlined in the Governor-General's Speech are placed upon the statute-book, the industrial and social life of Australia will be to a large extent revolutionized.' i have been too long a student of politics to imagine that any party, however strong, can bring about great reforms in a moment, or that it is possible to accomplish anything like the millennium even in a very lengthy period. But in the reforms outlined in the references in the Governor-General's Speech to land taxation, the nationalization of monopolies as a question to be submitted to the people by referendum, and the blow that is being struck at the borrowing policy by the advent to power of the Labour party, we shall be laying the foundation of great things in the future of Australia.

I believe that even as the Constitution stands at present the Government would have done well to indicate their intention to propose an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in one or two directions. I think there is no occasion to wait for an amendment of the Constitution in order to extend the scope of that Act. When the Conservative forces were predominant in this Parliament, our party found it impossible to pass into law such an Arbitration Act as they desired, and by reason of the then, strength of Conservatism, provisions were included in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act restricting its operation. Those provisions should be removed without any delay. One of them prevents preference being given to unions whose rules provide for political action. It has become obvious to members of any and every political party that politics are indissolubly bound up with the Labour movement, and that industrial and political action are part and parcel of the same movement. It is of no use now for Conservatism to try to prevent the rightful concession of preference to unionists on the plea that unions undertaking political action should not be treated in the same way as the old unions that held aloof from politics. There is one union in the Commonwealth which has exercised possibly a greater influence on politics in Australia than any other half-dozen.

There is the Pastoralists Union's history, but mine is the true one, and is based upon the facts that have been elicited. I complain that there is no reference in the Governor-General's Speech to any intention on the part of the Government to submit an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to repeal the foolish disqualification to which I have referred. Every union worthy of the name takes an active part in politics to-day. Politics touch the life of the community in every direction, and it is practically impossible for any industrial organization, whose members suffer as they do from evils created by past legislation, to abstain from active political work. Now that we have a majority in both Houses of the Federal Parliament, we should deal with this matter without delay. Another restriction which exists under the present law, and which was proposed by the strength of Conservatism in these Chambers a few years ago, is that preventing the employes in the agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural industries from registering their unions under the Act. It was supposed - and that was the only reason which I have ever heard advanced - that these industries were, to some extent, dependent for their markets on the ruling prices of the world, and not on local conditions. They were not to be subject to any laws regulating the rates of wages or the conditions of labour. If .it is right that a union should exist in connexion with the pastoral industry, such as the Australian Workers Union, when pastoral products have to compete in the markets of the world, then what argument can be advanced against the wheat-grower or the grower of grapes not receiving the benefits of the Act? There is a union in the industry with which I am connected. There is a small struggling union of orchard employes; and I, as a small fruit-grower, can assert that there is no other industry in which the employes are worse treated as regards rates of pay and hours of labour. Yet, under that disqualification, if the Orchardists Union becomes federated all over the States, it will be unable to avail itself of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act. There is another body known as the Rural Workers Union, which intends to cover farming, harvesting, and all that sort of work; but it is precluded from registering under the Act. I think that the Government, in view of the fact that all these persons connected with unions are the most active Labour supporters, should lose no time in bringing in a short Bill to remove the disqualification. It will not involve any complicated work, as the object is simply to remove restrictions which our Conservative opponents succeeded in placing in the Act a few years ago, and which did a great deal to impair its usefulness. But in regard to the general question the proposal to take two referenda as soon as possible is one which meets with my heartiest approval; and which, I believe, will be indorsed by every well-wisher of the movement throughout Australia. I do not wish to wait for three years to get an amendment of the  Constitution which will enable new Protection to be effectively guaranteed. I am entirely at one with those who believe that no general revision of the Tariff should be attempted until we are absolutely sure of obtaining all the benefits which can be secured by the system roughly known as new Protection. It would be a suicidal policy to grant further concessions to manufacturers until we have got them sufficiently under the whip, to see that those advantages are distributed throughout the whole community, and their employes guaranteed fair wages.

You would soon bring that unscrupulous class of persons to their senses if you acted in that way to one or two 'industries; and even if. incidentally, you inflicted some loss of employment upon those whom they had attempted to rob, the sum total of the good which would be effected would be much greater than the suffering which would be occasioned. When we cannot get all the good which we want, then, as a matter of common sense, we get the greatest good for the greatest number.

I believed that in Socialism lay the only true remedy for these evils. That being so, I think that any great amount of energy spent in obtaining the sort of doubtful benefits which may flow from fiscal reform would be better spent in attacking what we really believe to be at the root of our troubles, and that is a monopoly of wealth by a few, and the practical wage slavery of the many. However, I have no doubt that the proposed referenda will, if submitted to the people within twelve months, be carried by a huge majority. I think that the people generally are anxious that Parliament should not be fettered in carrying out those laws which the Constitution at present gives it some power to enact. The average man in the street sees no reason why there should be permission given in the Constitution to establish an Arbitration Court to deal with the prevention and settlement of disputes extending over more than one State, and a whole army of lawyers be almost continuously engaged in trying to prove that this or that particular matter is not within the jurisdiction of the Court. The majority of people, while they are foolish enough to allow themselves to be humbugged, do not like to be humbugged, and do not wish- the Constitution to put them in that position. They want to see equal justice extended to employers and employes so far as any tribunal can do that. I believe that throughout the whole industrial ranks there is a desire that the Arbitration Court should be clothed with sufficient powers to enable it to deal with any cases of industrial disputes which extend beyond the limits of a State. I go further than that;- I believe that the majority of the unions would like to have the right to appeal from their own little narrow industrial tribunals to what they would naturally regard as the most just, fair, and broad-minded tribunal established in the Commonwealth.

In regard to the nationalization of monopolies, I was asked to define what a monopoly is. I do not profess to be an encyclopaedia, or even a dictionary; but whilst it may not be easy to give a definition, I am satisfied that honorable senators know very well what a monopoly is. Take the word ' genius.' While there are some who are incontestably worthy of being called men of genius, yet there has never been a definition of that word which has given general satisfaction. Similarly, although we may know a thing to be a monopoly, and may feel the evil effects of it, yet we may be unable to give an exact definition of the word we use to describe it. I contend that wherever any industry requires such a large amount of capital to make it successful that only a few individuals or firms can possibly undertake it, that industry becomes a monopoly. Where a few firms only undertake any industry, combination among them is easy. Indeed', it is practically impossible to prevent combination by any legislation which we may pass. We may have honorable or dishonorable understandings between men and firms; but when only a few of them are engaged in any business, or are conducting any public service or utility, the experience ot the world is that in such instances the natural tendency is for them to combine for their own advantage, irrespective of the well-being of the community they are serving.

These persons are continually stating that, if preference to unionists be granted, a number of men who are not members of the unions will be starved. What does that statement amount to? It amounts to saying that there is not enough work to go round amongst all the persons in the industry in question; and that, therefore, if a preference be given to unionists, there will be a balance of employes who will have no work to do. Suppose that no preference were given, and that unionists and non-unionists were employed indiscriminately. Suppose there were 10,000 men looking for work in a particular industry, and that it could not employ more than 9,000; it would follow that 1,000 men would either starve for want of work, or would have to seek other employment. Whether the 9,000 who were employed were i unionists or otherwise, there would still be 1,000 who would have no work. Therefore, those who say that preference to unionists means the starvation of non-unionists, make a false deduction. In so doing, they really launch an impeachment of present industrial system; because, in any case, there would be a number of persons out of employment who would be left to starve or battle for casual work' for a crus It is,  I repeat, an impeachment of the whole system, and bears out entirely what ad vanced Labourites have always preached,' that so long as production is conducted for profit only and not for use, so long as our present iniquitous commercial system continues, unionism is absolutely necessary, or wages will be reduced to a mere subsistence level. It is only that surplus labour under our present system that enables the employers to compete one against another, and causes dissension between unionists and non-unionists. Without prolonging the debate unduly, I should like to say a word or two as to the financial policy of the Government. Nothing gave me greater pleasure than the announcement in the Governor - General's Speech that the Naval Loan Bill is to be repealed. I have heard it stated that the Commonwealth Labour party has not, at any time, pronounced absolutely against borrowing; but simply wishes to restrict borrowing. I have heard the present Prime Minister, and other leading members of the party, say that they strenuously object to making the Commonwealth a seventh borrower while the States are indulging in the system of unrestricted borrowing; and that, until the States debts are consolidated, or some arrangement is made to limit and control the borrowing powers of the States, they view almost with horror the idea of the Commonwealth going into the money market. I may say at once, if that be the common idea, that I am absolutely opposed to borrowing altogether. I have frequently been faced with this question, which the questioner generally thought to be a poser which could' not be answered: ' If you can borrow at a certain percentage, and invest that money in such a way as to make 3, 5, or 10 per cent, out of it, would you not be foolish to decline to borrow? And, if that be the case in regard to an individual, is not it equally the case in regard to a Government?' My contention is that there is no analogy whatever between a private individual and a community or nation. If an individual finds that he can borrow at 6 per cent., and earn 8 or 10 per cent, with the money, it is perfectly legitimate for him to borrow, under present-day conditions. It may be his only way of making any money. If a man wants to extend his business operations, and there is no other way of increasing his capital than by borrowing, he is justified in doing so. But a nation is in an entirely different position. A private individual or a firm does not possess the taxing power by which a nation can raise the money necessary for carrying on its transactions. Consequently, a nation can do very many things without borrowing at all. My contention is that borrowing not only leads to a profligate and spendthrift policy, but also to taxing the poor for the benefit of the rich. I want to do the reverse. Any community which borrows for other than emergencies is simply assisting an idle class to live upon the interest which is drawn from the sweat and blood of the workers. So far as we can abstain from borrowing, we shall be helping a vast majority of the people. The total debt of the States is over ^250,000,000. The public debt of New South Wales exceeds ^90,000,000, and every year New South Wales pays by way of interest approximately j£3, 250,000. Let us consider for a moment what an enormous proportion of the total revenue derived from legitimate forms of taxation has annually to be paid away in interest upon our indebtedness. Let us consider the increasing percentage of revenue, which, as our public indebtedness grows, must be paid away as interest upon past liabilities. Let us reflect for a moment upon how public work after public work has been undertaken, how it has served its purpose, how it has been replaced by another work without the original loan ever having been liquidated, and how a fresh loan has been contracted to pay for its replacement. Yet this is the sort of thing in which our alleged statesmen have been revelling for generations. If we consider the position, we shall find that the persons who are living upon the interest which we pay, and who comprise a large portion of the moneyed and leisured classes of Great Britain, are just as truly living upon the workers of this country as are the individuals who derive a profit from gambling, or from any other source without working for it. The statement that we have had the benefit of the money thus borrowed is an absolute fallacy. As a matter of fact, the total amount which we have received represents only a small percentage of the sum borrowed. If we take into consideration underwriters' charges and other incidental expenses, it will be found that we have obtained only a very small proportion of the money which we are supposed to have borrowed. Time will not permit me to deal with this question exhaustively, but even those who do not share my own views upon it must admit that above all things we ought to pay spot cash for the defence of our country. We talk about an Australian Navy. I hold in my hand a copy of a proclamation forbidding the Cerberus to fire salutes in the future to visiting men of war for fear she should break up. I suppose that we have all heard of the boat on the American River which could only whistle when she slopped. In other words, she could not whistle and steam at the same time. It seems to me that the Cerberus occupies very much the same position. If she fires a salute, she will probably damage herself.

Apparently, it was a sort of dying kick by the late Administration. Fancy borrowing money with which to build a Navy composed of vessels of that class - ships which dare not fire a salute for fear of sinking themselves instead of the enemy. We all know that in consequence of the improvements which are constantly being made in warships, vessels of the most approved type now become obsolete in a few years. Consequently, to borrow money in times of peace for the purpose of constructing vessels which cannot have a lifetime of more than ten or twelve years would be the most spendthrift policy imaginable. If we regard defence as a form of national insurance, we ought surely to be prepared to pay the premiums upon that insurance year by year as they fall due. In that respect, I trust that the policy of the Government will be steadfastly upheld, and that in the future no party will go back upon it. I have no desire to traverse the whole of the Governor-General's Speech, but I do hope that at an early date the Ministry will afford the Parliament an opportunity of remedying a serious defect in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Honorable senators are doubtless aware that under a recent decision of the High Court that statute has been placed in further jeopardy. At the present moment, a big case, which must shortly come before the Arbitration Court, is pending. It must come before that tribunal within a few weeks, and I contend that in the interim this Parliament ought so to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as to place the Court in a position to know definitely whether or not it is entitled to grant a preference to Unionists. The Australian Workers Union is the industrial body interested in that case and it is now going through the necessary legal formalities prior to its claim reaching the Arbitration Court. I submit that the law should be so clarified or extended as to enable that tribunal to know exactly what are its powers in such cases, so that a union will not be put to vast expense in upholding its claim after an award has been made. Whilst unions have been penalized for striking on the ground that they have been afforded a lawful and expeditious method of settling their industrial disputes without resort to that barbarous weapon, they have, in reality, been, giver* only a stone when they asked for bread. After expending a large portion of their funds in attempting to secure, a judicial settlement of their disputes, after bringing incontestable evidence of the justice of their claims, and after being granted a measure of relief by the Arbitration Court, they have been robbed of the fruits of their victory upon pure technicalities. It will be a standing disgrace to the Ministry if they permit such a state of things to continue a moment longer than is unavoidable. We know that the Government are in entire sympathy with the aims and ideals of industrial union. But it is not sufficient for them to be sympathetic with those aims and ideals. They must utilize the machinery which is at their command for the purpose of meting out justice to the workers. At the recent general elections, thousands of persons who are not connected with our organizations voted for Labour candidates.

A body, which was then known as the Labour Electoral League, was formed, and it admitted freely to its ranks persons who had never been members of a trade union, provided that they subscribed to the principles laid down in its platform.

I was in the district when there was no idea that it would ultimately be the site of the Federal Capital. I was also at Dalgety in the good old days, when it was known as Buckley's Crossing, and there was certainly no idea then that it would ever be the site of the Federal Capital. Honorable senators will agree with me that a man travelling through those districts as I did would not observe them in the way in which he would do if he understood that they were likely to be selected for the site of the Federal Capital. I have not now a clear recollection of the nature of the country I saw at Dalgety or in the neighbourhood of Yass-Canberra. If the matter has not already been settled by mere administrative action, and if there is to be any reconsideration of the question in this Chamber at all. I believe that an opportunity should be afforded honorable senators who have not seen the two sites to visit them. I cannot see how one could pass a fair and impartial judgment upon them otherwise. So far as it can be determined by mere observation, my mind is at present quite open as to the special advantages or disadvantages of either of the sites that have been suggested, and in considering the matter on broader grounds as to whether Yass-Canberra is too near Sydney and Dalgety too near Melbourne, I can promise that I shall take no parochial view of the question. Personally, I believe that the further we get away from Sydney, without getting too near Melbourne, the better, and it would be well if we could secure a suitable site about equi-distant between those two cities. If a suitable site could be found away up in the Northern Territory, I think that is where I should like to see the Federal Capital established. Man is by nature better fitted to inhabit the  Tropics than the Arctic circle, and I think' it would suit most Australians better to live in a warm climate than in a cold one. I regard an adequate water supply for the Federal Capital as indispensable, and that Yass-Canberra possesses such a supply is not proved, to my mind, by facts and figures submitted by a biased State Premier like Brother Wade.

I have always been of a sceptical nature, and require to be convinced by the evidence of my senses. I cannot take even Senator W. 'Russell's absolute pronouncement in this matter. I want to know the cost which will be involved in constructing a railway from the proposed site at Yass-Canberra to Jervis Bay. I wish to know, also, whether the agreement to cede the territory to the Commonwealth can be amended or modified to provide that the Commonwealth shall have not merely occupation rights, but sovereign rights, over the strip of country on which the railway is to be constructed, and over the land to be ceded at Jervis Bay. Though not a lawyer, I- understand that there is a great difference between having possession of, or the right to occupy, land and having* sovereign rights over it. If, as I understand, the Commonwealth is merely to have the right to occupy the land on which the railway from the capital to Jervis Bay is to be constructed and the area ceded at Jervis Bay, that will not suit me. I desire that the Commonwealth shall have absolutely unassailable sovereign rights over not only the Federal Territory in which the Capita'l is established, .but also over the area at Jervis Bay and over the strip of land connecting the bay with the Capital. Furthermore, I want the proposed Federal Territory to be enlarged until it embraces the watersheds of the rivers supplying the Capital. I should be content to accept nothing less than that for Yass-Canberra, Dalgety, or any other site. The Commonwealth Government should not be placed in the position of having to depend upon the goodwill or charity of any more or less cantankerous State Premier to be assured that the water supply of the Federal Capital will be conserved, and will not be polluted or otherwise interfered with. The watershed of the rivers supplying the Capital must be under the absolute sovereignty of the Commonwealth. Any honorable senator who read the press comments, especially in New South Wales, about what that State is called upon to give away will know the tremendous outcry that was raised against the area of land asked for. It is provided in the Constitution that the area ceded for the purposes of the Federal Capital shall not be less than 100 square miles. The Sydney newspapers in particular interpreted that to mean that it should not be more than 200 square miles. They contended that in good faith the provision with respect to too square miles meant from 100 square miles to 200 square miles, and that the State was extravagantly generous in conceding 900 square miles for the Federal Territory. I ask honorable senators to reflect for a moment that New South Wales has an area of 310,000 square miles. An area of 1,000 square miles or of 5,000 square miles deducted from the total area of the State would amount to practically nothing.

I think that if the Government of a State, possessing an area of 310,000 square miles, could not spare the odd 10,000 square miles for the purpose of a Federal Territory without making a song about it, they must be pretty mean. When those who are opposed to granting so large an area denounce Dalgety as a barren worthless land, and at the same time raise an outcry against the extortionate demands of the Commonwealth, the one assertion disproves the other. If the land is so barren and worthless as they represent, why should they object to part with it? I believe that a majority in each House is in favour of preserving the land to the people, never to be parted with to the land speculator. If that is so, why should we not have a sufficiently large area to secure the whole of the unearned increment for the Commonwealth, and not allow the speculator to come within coo-ee of our Capital? I look upon this as a very important question. When, some few years ago, the Daily Telegraph of Sydney stated, as though it was an unpardonable crime to even think of it, that the desire for a large area was in order that a Labour majority, when it got hold of the Parliament, might conduct socialistic experiments, I cheerfully admitted that that was my object. I want to see socialistic experiments carried on, in fact, I want to see any experiments carried on which will demonstrate the inherent rottenness of the present system. But land ownership is not an experiment. It is as simple as A. B. C The Duke of Westminster, in London, by simply holding on to some lands which may have been swamps when his ancestors got possession of them, can reap enormous fortunes; and a man does not need to possess intellect above that of an idiot to hold land once it has been acquired. We know very well that if the Commonwealth retains the ownership, the land in the Federal Territory is bound to grow in value. Most capitals in this world have grown up, more or less, by accident. As to very few towns have we had the advantage of knowing beforehand that they were going to become large or great. In Australia, inland anyway, the beginning of an ordinary town has been a public-house established alongside a crossing over a river or creek, a blacksmith, and other persons following the publican, until, by-and-by, a village has grown up. This has become, in time, a town, or even a big city. In the case of the Federal Capital, however, we know beforehand that some millions will be required to build the necessary official buildings. The head-quarters of the Departments, the Governor-General's residence, the Houses of Parliament, and other works of a durable and important character, will involve an enormous expenditure, extending over a long period of years. Is it not certain, therefore, that those who will have to minister to the wants of the men engaged in the building operations, not to speak of the Legislature, and the Civil Service, will constitute a large subsidiary population, so to speak, whose presence is bound to give an improved value to the Commonwealth lands? Nothing seems clearer than that, if we retain the lands, all this talk about the vast expense of a bush Capital will fall to the ground; because the enhanced values will absolutely cover the cost of constructing buildings and laying out the 'site.

I am now dealing with the argument that the establishment of a bush Capital would be an unnecessary drain on our resources. If we established a permanent Capital within an existing metropolitan area, it would cost infinitely more than it will cost to erect a Capital in the bush. We should require to put up fresh buildings, and the value of the sites would far exceed the cost of establishing a new Capital on Federal Territory.-. I rejoice very much that, owing to the State I represent - in a very narrow spirit, I thought at the time - trying to make a grab for the Capital, and not leaving it an open question, as a checkmate to the effort to drag it to Sydney, the other members of the Convention, in consenting to the Capital being established in New South Wales, made the condition that it should not be established within 100 miles of Sydney. I hold that it would be a fatal mistake to have our Capital in a coastal city, or even to have it in an existing town. It should be established in what is at present uninhabited territory, so that the growing land values shall belong to those who make them, and shall not be the property of the speculator. I have spoken at much greater length than I had intended. I- trust that the programme which has been placed before Parliament, certainly in a very vague and general way, so far as the Speech is concerned, will be carried into effect without delay. I feel certain that honorable senators opposite will not oppose in an obstructive way the measures which will Be submitted. Not only are there very few of those honorable senators now, but we have knocked most of the fight out of them, and as practically every one of the leading proposals of the Government has received the indorsement of a huge majority of the people, they, for the sake of their own political skins three years hence, will shrink from putting up much, of a fight against any one of the measures, and, in a general way, they do not seem much inclined to obstruct. I want them to realize, however, that we shall attempt to capture the remaining seats at the next election. As they know that no mercy will then be extended to them, they will, of course, be quite within their rights in fighting us here. I hope that whilst this programme, which, generally speaking, I support, will be carried into law, it will only be the forerunner of much bigger things. Instead of looking upon it as an extreme one, I marvel at its moderation. I think that if there is one fault which can be found by the electors who returned us with such a sweeping majority, it is at our not grasping at a great deal more. I trust that the Senate, which, by force of circumstances, is put in a kind of subordinate position to the other House, will assert itself, and prove in the future to be the more democratic and advanced Chamber of the two.

Others consider that, in all probability, whatever party may be in power five or six years hence it will be compelled to review the situation. It is not a question on which there should be a great party clamour. It is a question of what we shall be able to do with the money which we have, in view of the obligations which we have to meet. I have a very great doubt, as I should have even if I were in favour of giving the States £2 per head for 100 years, as to whether we shall be able to pay them even the 25s. per capita five or six years hence.

They said, if it were put in the Constitution, it would not be in for long, because it could be taken out by merely passing a law. But if the Labour party's attitude were adopted, and the agreement were made for ten years, the people would put the States in a much tighter corner.

For my own part, I believe that the more simplicity is displayed in the conduct of our business the more effectual will be the results. I should like, before concluding, to refer to some of the arguments used in reference to the proposed Commonwealth note issue. It has been said that the Labour party is against borrowing, and yet that we are really securing a forced loan of some £3,000,000 or £4,000,000. The Government scheme provides for keeping 25 per cent, of the amount of the note issue in gold, and additional security will be provided by Treasury-bills being prepared and kept ready for issue at any moment to cover the whole of the notes issued. That has deprived our opponents of the cry they raised about a wild-cat scheme in imitation of those South American republics which have indulged in a debased paper currency. Our opponents being deprived of the charge that the Labour party are going to debase the currency, it is now said that the Federal note issue is in the nature of a forced loan. In another Chamber an eminent financial authority, Mr. Bruce Smith, used that argument.

The objection to loans, from a national po in t of view, is the burden of in terest that they carry. I take it that if 75 per cent, or 70 per cent, of the note issue that is not kept as a reserve fund is at the disposal of the Federal Treasurer, he will not only have that sum without in terest, but he will have a loan which will never require repayment. A loan that does not require redemption is practically a gift. If the banks have to deposit a sovereign for each note issued, and if the total amount of the deposit leaves a marg in after provid in g a reserve of some ,£4,000,000 or £5,000,000, and the notes have to be constantly renewed, it follows that the Commonwealth will get that sum free, and will be able to spend it for public purposes. That is far higher f in ance than the k in d which consists in go in g to the money-lenders of Great Brita in for a loan. It seems to me that this note issue is a prelim in ary to the establishment of a Commonwealth bank. I recognise, however, that that will be a much more delicate matter, and will require very careful consideration. Still, however, I see noth in g whatever to prevent the Commonwealth from manag in g a bank just as wisely and as prudently as such an in stitution can be managed at present by private in dividuals. We are cont in ually told that in the Public Service every one is simply try in g to get through his day's work with the least possible exertion, that the Government stroke prevails, and that if a Government bank were established those responsible for it would consider it immaterial whether they made a good in vestment or a bad one. Those who hold that op in ion know very little about our Government officers. I venture to say that in the Government Departments there are some of the most honest, capable, and energetic men in the country. Many of them regard their work as their pr in cipal in terest in life, and devote far more time to it than is required under the rules of the Service. I know of men of the highest calibre who have broken down in health through enthusiastic devotion to their work. They regard it as far more than the means of earn in g a livelihood. It is a mistake to suppose that the shareholders in jo in t stock banks know more about the bus in ess of bank in g than do the ord in ary members of the public. A man who in vests his money in the stock of a private enterprise bank has to trust to expert ability for the efficient management of the in stitution. He- has to trust to men who hold salaried positions to use his money wisely. There is no reason why men who are paid to do the bank in g bus in ess of a Government should not discharge their duties as efficiently as do those who are paid to transact the bus in ess of a jo in t stock bank. There is no reason why a Commonwealth bank should not be as efficiently managed as is any bank in the country at present. If a private bank in g company can obta in the services of a good manag in g director, a Commonwealth in stitution can do the same th in g whenever the time is ripe to launch this scheme. I confess that there is one disadvantage from which the State suffers, namely, that too often those in authority place too low an estimate upon the market value of the labours of those whom they employ. The manager of a great public Department is frequently paid for his services so very much less than is paid by private enterprise for the performance of similar duties, that he rel in quishes State employment for private employment. But if we are prepared to pay the true market value for a man's services, we shall be able to secure the very best talent available to manage an in stitution of this k in d. I trust, therefore, that, whilst the utmost care will be exercised in fram in g a measure of this character, no time will be lost in in itiat in g this desirable reform. I believe that if we once break down the land monopoly on the one hand, and the money monopoly on the other, we shall be in a fair way to secure to the whole community those social powers which are necessary for its effective government and economic management. It appears to me that a great many men - even some of the members of my own party - have been rather reluctant to confess themselves Socialists. They nave been afraid that, to many persons, the word had such an evil significance that such a confession would imperil their political existence. I contend that the trend of events the whole world over is in the direction of Socialism. That trend is in evitable. Noth in g can avert it, because it is the result of economic conditions. I hold that the Labour movement is the practical expression of so much of that Socialism as the community is ripe for. We are not attempt in g to in jure any class, irrespective of whether they be land-owners or land users. We are not, as our opponents argue, a mere body of city unionists who are engaged in well organized and highly paid 'trades - in short, we are not what has been contemptuously termed, a ' Trades Hall party.' But we are advocat in g pr in ciples which, if given effect to, will gradually result in the substitution of well ordered, collective action for the present chaotic, competitive system which satisfies nobody and impoverishes thousands. While, under that system, a few build up fortunes, and a few more occupy comfortable positions in life, the great body of the people - though not perhaps cast in that poverty which is prevalent in other countries - f in d no security in their position. They do not know from day to day, or month to month, whether or not the in come which they are now deriv in g will be secured to them. No work in g man 'knows what will become of his widow and helpless children, if his health breaks <3own, or if death overtakes him. This in security and anxiety for the future are responsible for many premature deaths, and for a good deal of ill health. In other words, worry and work are very in equitably distributed at the present time. Our object is to. br in g about a fairer distribution. We know that this can be accomplished only so far as the great body of electors are prepared to work with us, to understand the pr in ciples which we advocate, and to vote for them. For that reason, our party propose noth in g of a ' wild cat' character to revolutionize society. We propose only to in troduce reforms which will pave the way for that collective organization of society in which one will help the other. Whether it be called Socialism or national cooperation, it is clearly a higher and more advanced stage of human development than that in which we live to-day. I trust that my efforts, and those of my colleagues, will help forward this movement, which - even if we opposed it - present-day economic conditions of themselves would in evitably br in g about in the not distant future.

Therefore, the time which is devoted to a discussion of this character might much more profitably be employed in dealing with the practical business of .the session.

My heart is in my boots when I look around the chamber - as I have done during the past few days - and notice the empty Opposition benches. After the battle, when the rival parties appear in Parliament, and we start to sum up the results of a general election, we begin to reflect how we got here, and how some of our comrades failed to do so. But on this occasion our opponents have been entirely vanquished. Talk about the fate of the Light Brigade! There is only a slight resemblance between their fate and that of our opponents at the last election. Before proceeding further, I wish to congratulate you, sir, upon the very commendable stand that you have taken in discarding those emblems of mediaeval mysticism - the President's wig and gown. They have been handed down to us from the time when they were worn by the few - an insignificant few - to impress upon the vast majority a sense of their importance. I am very glad that you have blazed the pathway for other governing' bodies throughout the Commonwealth to follow, and that you have disregarded the beaten track which has been so long trodden by your predecessors. I only hope that the practice of discussing the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply will also be abolished. There are other innovations, I think, which might be introduced with very great advantage to this Parliament. We have all witnessed the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament at different times, and it appears to me that at that ceremony, the military part of our citizenship figures with undue prominence. I think that that feature might well be eliminated. There is no reason why this Parliament should not be opened in the sane, deliberate fashion that is observed in other countries. It would lose nothing in dignity, and its sphere of usefulness as a Legislature whose function it is to give expression to the will of the people, would be in no way impaired. Indeed, if it were opened with the simplicity which characterized the opening of the United States Congress some years ago, when President Jackson rode up to the Capitol upon his shaggy pony, hitched it, entered the Congress, opened it, remounted his shaggy pony and rode away, it would stand upon an equal plane with that body. There is no necessity for a military display at the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament. Personally, I have an innate horror of such spectacles, because my mind instinctively reverts to the time when I saw the red-coats used by a small and insignificant minority of the people for the purpose of crushing the majority- with a strong hand. When every effort was being made by a struggling people to rise from a position of degradation to a higher level, there was an unnecessary parade of militarism.

Although I have no desire to waste time,, because I recognise that important work awaits us, I cannot close my eyes to the tactics which were adopted by some of the men who led that campaign aga in st the Labour party. A gallant effort was made by the leaders of the Fusionist movement to divide the sheep from the goats - to br in g; under their banner every- element in the political life of this country save that of the Labour party. But if we cast our m in ds back for a brief period, we shall remember that no great zeal was then displayed for the formation of only two political parties. I can recollect the time when the Labour party exercised very great in fluence in the New South Wales Parliament. While it was engaged in keep in g in power there what was then regarded as the most progressive political party, politicians saw no necessity to br in g about the two-party system of government. On the contrary, they found it very convenient to have the assistance of the Labour party. The clamour for the two-party system was due simply to the grow in g popularity of the Labour party. When, by d in t of our efforts in the political field over a number of years, and with a powerful press aga in st us, we had at length succeeded in reach in g the popular ear, and in impress in g upon the majority of the people a sense of the justice and wisdom of adopt in g the views we had taken so much trouble to place before them, our opponents recognised that we were steadily advanc in g in popularity, and it was then that they clamoured for the two-party system. It was then that we found brought in to one fold men whose political op in ions were as wide apart as the poles, and who were agreed only in their in veterate opposition to a Labour candidate. The Fusion candidates posed throughout the country as exemplars in politics as well as in society, but what did they do? From my observations in one part of the Commonwealth, I noticed that they scarcely left anytH in g of a shady character unsaid or undone to place themselves in a favorable light and to down their opponents.

We found some of the men who had the cheek to put themselves forward in this way in the press resorting almost to the tactics of the gimlet brigade. They sent a photographer around to take photographs of four-roomed houses occupied by Labour candidates, and exhibited these as affording a reason why the Labour party should not be supported. I grant that they omitted to 'say whether there were mortgages on these four-roomed houses. They even went so far as to go to South Africa to secure a photograph of Mr. Chris. Watson with a Kaffir beside him. Perhaps we should be thankful for small mercies, and the wonder is that they did not pursue their policy of espionage still further. I wonder that they did not employ the gimblet brigade to find out the internal arrangements of the four-roomed houses j to find out what the Labour candidates had for breakfast, and whether they slept between sheets. I wonder that they did not send out photographers to discover where Labour candidates got their meals. I begin to think that I may have had a happy escape, because after a trip in the country I have sometimes plunged a little, and have visited a shilling restaurant. I am surprised that my footsteps were not dogged by the agents of these people in order that a photograph might have been secured of a Labour candidate who bacl the audacity to patronize a shilling restaurant when there were plenty of sixpenny restaurants to which he might have gone. This does not exhaust my indictment of the tactics of the Fusion party at the last election.  Sitting stiff ended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. They exhibited equal ingenuity in their description of the attitude of the Labour party towards those engaged in the primary industries. They endeavoured to induce the farmers to believe that the policy of the Labour party is entirely opposed to the farming interests. They made, a special effort in this direction in Western Australia, in order to bring about a severance between the farming interest and the political Labour party in the State. They went to extreme pains to circulate throughout the State the opinions expressed by an isolated member of the party in Western Australia.

To suggest that the Labour party would be unjust to the farming interest is certainly not in accordance with the facts. The pamphlet to which I have referred is signed by Mr. Clarke James, who was one of the principal agents of our opponents in Western Australia. It shows the extreme lengths to which they were prepared to go to misrepresent the attitude of the Labour party to the farming interest. I speak as a farmer, and I say that the farming interest has nothing to fear at the hands of the Labour party. Wherever our policy has received the remotest encouragement, the farmers, as a class, have been the direct gainers. We can point to innumerable instances in South Australia where, as the result of the modification of the policy of our opponents, through the pressure exercised by Labour members in the State Parliament, many benefits have been brought to the door of the farmer which he would not otherwise have received. The circulation of the statements of this member of the South Australian Labour party, which had not the indorsement of the party as a whole, did not complete the efforts of our' opponents in Western Australia. In another circular signed by Mr. Clarke James, the leading agent of the brigade responsible for the dissemination of these tarradiddles, I find the statement -  The policy of the Labour party is to starve the States, and if they had their way with the financial agreement our revenue from the Commonwealth would decrease as our population increases. 1 have analyzed the various proposals submitted to this Parliament during the last three or four years for the settlement of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth, but I have been unable to discover anything in the financial proposals of the Labour party to suggest that it is their policy to starve the States, o'.- that if their policy were carried out, it would have the effect of decreasing the returns to the States as their population increases. Such a statement of the effects of our policy is,- of course, at total variance with the facts, hut it was quite good enough to suit the book of our opponents in the Western State. They circulated these two ' De Rougemonts,' because they are nothing else, with a view to render our party unpopular in the country. I recognise that political parlies do not always rigidly adhere to the truth in the prosecution of their campaign, and this is borne out in the document bearing the signature of our opponents, and professing to describe the effect of the financial policy of the Labour party as being calculated to starve the States, and to decrease their revenue as their population increases.

We had evidence in the Western State that money was flowing from a central treasury in Perth to every small centre of population in a particular district of the State, expressly to forward the interests of Fusion candidates. We were puzzled to know where the money came from. We cannot understand where it came from. But from reports to hand from time to time, and especially from the admissions of the real actors in the play, we are at least entitled to assume, if not to decide, that the amounts which are specified in the Electoral Act were far exceeded in Western Australia. In touring the Swan division, I found, from the reports of friends, and sometimes of opponents, that an unlimited amount of capital was being expended in every small centre. When one arrived at a small place, the first person of any importance one would meet would be a representative of the Fusion party. In Bunbury, the only place which we are told can give birth to a Premier, £200 was expended, according to the best authority. I wish it to be understood that the opinions I am expressing are not my own, nor those of our supporters in the field, but the opinions which were held, with every justification, I believe, by our opponents. It was universally admitted in that centre that at least £200 was expended to advance the interests of the Fusionist candidate. Another gentleman whom I know very well was a travelling organizer, who confined his attention 10 the Swan electorate. He must have received at least £4 or £5 a week for a period of six or seven weeks. In the Newcastle district there was a gentleman who described himself as a Fusion agent. There was also a Fusion agent in Bridgetown, Mundijong, Yaloop, Pin jelly, and Albany. In various places throughout the Swan division there was a man stationed who, if he did not devote the whole of his time to electioneering, had little time left to apply to his own business.

I am glad that we have this chance of describing how the election campaign was conducted, and the unfair means which were resorted to by our opponents, in order to place the Labour party unfavorably in the eyes of the public. There were also lady canvassers - four or five - who took a tour in that part of the constituency. The sum total of this financial effort was, according to my best calculations, that at least £480 was put up for the purpose of paying the officials in the employ of the Fusion party, and advancing their interest in that small part of Western Australia. I do not intend to labour these events, except to show that there is need for holding an inquiry. If the Government are satisfied that money has been unlawfully spent for the purpose of violating the provisions of the law which we are all supposed to observe, it is their duty to probe the facts of the last contest in Western Australia, and to find out if any money .was expended, especially illegally expended, for the purpose of bringing about our defeat. It is the particular duty of the Labour Government to set a standard for all other Governments to follow, and therefore I hope that they will institute a searching inquiry. I do not know that I have much criticism to offer regarding the Speech, which sets out the main intentions of the Government. In the first place, it refers to the adjustment which is about to take place in the distribution of the net revenue from Customs and Excise.

They are not merely carrying on the civil government, but they are advancing far ahead of the provinces and the divisions to which I have alluded.

They are also carrying on an educational system, but they have nothing to do with the land, especially in Canada, and certainly they have nothing to do with the collective efforts which the States in Australia are at present making. When we reflect that the States of the Commonwealth stand on an entirely different basis from the divisions of other Federations, I think that we should move very gradually in the matter of cutting short the supply of funds which they have been in the habit of receiving from Customs and Excise. I am at one with those who fear that when the revenue from those sources sinks from 50s. a head to 30s. or 25s., it will be absolutely impossible to pay anything to the States. But, so long as the revenue keeps n the neighbourhood of 50s. a head, I chink that there is a sacred obligation cast upon the members of this Parliament to see that the springs of revenue which have been sustaining the life blood of the States should not be dried up so soon as some seem to indicate is desirable.  SenatorW. Russell. - What would he die effect on the revenue of a dry season or two? Unfortunately the revenue would rise, because we would have to purchase our supplies. In 1902, the revenue from Customs rose, because we had to get our supplies wherever we could, and at whatever it might cost. Looking at the matter broadly, I think that we are not entitled at present to limit the payment to the States to even ten years. I would favour a much longer term, the term of twenty-five years, which it was sought here last year to get inserted in the agreement. Certainly a longer term than ten years would best suit my view. I recognise that in this matter I may be suspected of being a believer in the State Rights policy. I do not think it necessary to argue that matter very fully. I need only point to the action which we took in Western Australia to get the Financial Agreement voted down. To all appearances that State stood to gain more under the agreement that did any of the other States, yet when the time came for expressing an opinion, we stood firmly by the attitude that this Parliament alone should have the final say in the distribution of the revenue from Customs and Excise. We had a strong opposition raised against us. We even had amongst our opponents some misguided adherents of Labour who thought that we were acting wrongly. We then took a stand which cannot justify a charge that I favour the State Rights policy if on the present occasion I say that ten years is rather too short a period to adopt. Of course, the object of the Financial Agreement was to try to keep the Fusion party in power at the expense of crippling the Commonwealth. It has been said that none sees the course of a game so clearly as do those who are watching it from the outside. It is, therefore, advantageous to read what the London Times has had to say on the situation.

Of course, I rejoice that the advice of that party was not taken by the electors; and I must add that a most systematic attempt was made in several States of the Union, not only to secure the acceptance of the Financial Agreement, but also the rejection of those who were opposed to it. The members of the State Governments themselves brought influence to bear, and even took to the platform and strained every nerve with the object of bringing about the defeat of the Labour nominees. This fact warrants the conclusion arrived at, not only by the members of this Parliament, but by a considerable number of the public outside, that the agreement arrived at by a secret Conference in Melbourne had a political significance which did not appear upon the face of the document. I notice in the Governor-General's Speech a very mild reference to the transcontinental railway. While I am glad that the subject has been mentioned, I should have been better pleased if the intentions of the Government had been set forth more explicitly, as was done with other items in their programme.

Ours is a party of action, and 1 am prepared to accept this mild reference to the subject as an earnest of the intention of the Government that something will be done in the direction of the performance of this great national work. Because, after all, it is a great national work. Look at what has been done by other Federations. In the United States three-quarters of a million dollars were spent on the survey of a transcontinental railway to connect the western sea-board with the east. In Canada, also, the Dominion Government fostered the construction of a transcontinental line. I suppose that there were some ' little Canadians ' who opposed the work, just as my honorable friend Senator Stewart has opposed our Australian railway. I hope, however, that he is now prepared to' look at the subject on broad Australian grounds, willing and anxious that the . Federal Government should take up so large and important a public work. I have no desire to make a special appeal for my own State. I am quite content to let this work rest on its own merits. But I cannot refrain from focussing attention on the fact that the western State has not benefited to the extent that the ardent supporters of Federation at the outset promised that it would do from the accomplishment of national union. I have always been content to depend upon the public spiritedness and the high sense of patriotism of the Federal Parliament to insure the completion of this work, and I do so still, but may I make a few remarks as to how Western Australia has been handicapped. I was sent here as a Protectionist, and the majority of my colleagues have also voted solidly with the object of fostering Australian industries, irrespective of whether Western Australia was concerned in them or not. But I regret to say that an examination of the facts shows that Western Australia has scarcely benefited at all. I take the following figures from the Commonwealth Year-Book. In New South Wales, from 1901 to 1908, the number of factories increased by 1,100. Victoria, in the same period, erected 600 new factories. In the case of South Australia and Queensland, the figures are not quite reliable, because a uniform system of recording industrial statistics was not adopted until considerably after Victoria and New South Wales agreed upon a common method. But the figures before me show that ninety fewer factories were in operation in South Australia. In Queensland, the number of factories decreased by 700. Tasmania built 130 new factories, and Western Australia only thirty-five. The increase in the number of employes is still more important. The term ' factory ' is vague, and conveys no idea of the number of persons employed. It is evidently better to have one factory employing a hundred persons than ten factories employing only ninety. In New South Wales, the number of persons employed in factories in the years mentioned increased by 23,000; in Victoria, by 20,000; in Queensland, by 3,000; in South Australia, by 5,000; in Tasmania, By 1,200; and in Western Australia by only 200. These figures are not encouraging in view of the fact that Western Australia has steadily supported Protection as a national policy. In view of that fact alone, reasonable consideration should be given to our claim, for the building of the transcontinental railway. I did not come here simply as a Western Australian. I came as an Australian, prepared to vote for bounties and for duties irrespective of the States that would benefit chiefly from them. But when we find that a State like Western Australia has so willingly participated in a policy which has benefited other States, it is surely only proper and just that the Federal Parliament should take stock of the position and give her some form of quid fro quo. I am somewhat disappointed that a more firm pronouncement has not been made concerning this great national work. I am anxious to see the two great lines constructed that will bridge over the vast spaces of our interior, and divert the activities of many' of our people from the coastal districts to the inland areas.

As far as land taxation is concerned, members of the Labour party have talked themselves hoarse on the public platform by devoting a great deal of time to impressing upon their constituents the need for this desirable reform - a reform which has been too long delayed, and which this country has been labouring to secure for many years. Had a progressive land tax been imposed in the past, it would have prevented our unfortunate settlers from trekking out to the dry arid soils of Australia, simply because they had been denied an opportunity of settling on the more fertile areas within the coastal fringe. Yet some honorable 'senators have the hardihood to suggest that the imposition of such a tax will constitute an intrusion upon State Rights. As a matter of fact, the position in regard to land legislation to-day is a standing monument to the stupidity of our politicians of the past. It is a standing indictment of the way in which they have shirked their duties by allowing settlement to run in directions that no country with any pretensions to sanity would allow it to run. In the State of Queensland, for which I have a warm corner in my heart, notwithstanding that it has returned Senator Stewart to this Parliament, what is the position?

As a member of the present Government, I have no intention of wasting time with anything. When we take a Bill in hand, I hope that we shall finish it expeditiously.

Senator St. Ledger should remember that while we sit here occupying a considerable time in doing what we might do in a few minutes, the electric light is burning, stationery is being wasted, and the time of members of the Senate and public officers is being practically wasted when it ought to be usefully employed. When we have an adjournment, we should have one which will suit the convenience of the majority of honorable senators. A very substantial majority of the members of the Senate have interests in Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania, and an adjournment for a day or for two or three days is of no use to them. I shall advise the Government, if possible, to provide for an adjournment which honorable senators will be able to make use of to visit their homes and their constituents. Although I cannot make a very definite statement to-night, I hope tomorrow afternoon to. be in a position to make a definite statement with respect to an adjournment for more than a few days. We have before us a Bill dealing with lighthouses, light-ships, beacons, and buoys, which has already been considered in the Senate under the late Government.

I gave notice of two other Bills to-day and my honorable colleague gave notice of a third. They are very short Bills, and if honorable senators are anxious to work, as I have been invited to believe, I hope we shall have finished with them on Friday, and we shall then be able to adjourn for two or three weeks at least. That is the position at present, and I need only add that we shall find work for the industrious senators opposite as soon as possible.  Question resolved in the affirmative.
