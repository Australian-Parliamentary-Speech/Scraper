For various reasons the sugar industry in other countries has always attracted a very great deal of attention, and has been the subject of much special legislation. I may be pardoned perhaps for going back a couple of centuries in connexion with this matter in order to inform honorable senators that from 1660 to 1854 British colonial sugar was admitted on preferential terms into Great Britain. The preference, which was a substantial one, was given to assist planters in British Possessions in the West Indies.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","32","CRAWFORD, Thomas","JRW","N/A","N/A","N/A","469","There is no reason why even in those days a fiscal effort should not have been made to assist one of the industries of the Empire. In 1854 the preferential duties to which I have referred were abolished, and slave grown sugar from Brazil and Cuba was admitted to Great Britain on the same terms as British colonial sugar.  It is interesting to note the way in which the production of sugar has increased. In 1853 the world's production of sugar amounted to 1,500,000 tons, whilst in 1914 it had risen to over 18,000,000 tons. This year it is estimated that the world's production of sugar will be 16,500,000 tons, showing a falling off of over 1,500,000 tons since the outbreak of the war. This reduction is due chiefly to the fact that the production, of sugar has practically ceased in Russia. Owing to the conditions at present existing in that country, Russia is neither producing nor consuming any sugar. If we eliminate Russia, we shall see that the world's production of sugar at the present time is just about equal to what it was at the outbreak of the war. I have been looking into the matter, and I find that practically the only country in which production has increased during the last eight years is Cuba, where, however, the production this year will be 500,000 tons less than it was in 1920-21. There has been for a great many years the keenest competition between beet and cane sugar. The increase in the production of beet sugar was largely due to the bounty legislation of European countries, and especially of Germany, Austria, and France. In 1896, Germany increased the import duty on sugar to Â£20 per ton, or double what it had been before, and increased the bounty on export to Â£10 per ton. Austria and France had to follow the example of Germany, and the effect of the legislation of these countries was to greatly stimulate the production of beet sugar, with the result that in a few years, in 1902, 88 per cent, sugar was selling at Â£6 per ton f.o.b. Hamburg. ","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","34","CRAWFORD, Thomas","JRW","N/A","N/A","N/A","470","Yes, of course; but the effect of the bounty of Â£10 per ton was to enable producers of sugar in Germany and other continental countries to sell sugar for export at a price considerably below the cost of production.  If no countervailing action had been taken, there is no doubt whatever that the production of beet sugar would have practically stopped the production of cane sugar, with the result that during the war there would certainly have been a sugar famine. The first country to take action was the United States of America, which imposed a countervailing duty upon all bounty sugars. In 1903 the Brussels Convention was signed, which provided for the abolition of all bounties upon sugar. This had the effect of so stimulating the industry in various countries that at the outbreak of war the production of cane sugar represented 54 per cent, of the total world's output. It is unfortunate that sugar-growing in Australia should be confined to practically one State. It is true that there are three sugar mills in New South Wales, producing at present about 15,000 tons per annum, and that in Victoria there is one beet-sugar factory, with an output of from 1,000 tons to 1,200 tons per annum. As a result, most of the business of sugar production in this country is being carried on in what, from a southern point of view, is a remote part of the Commonwealth, and, consequently, there is very much misunderstanding, both as to its conditions and requirements, and a very great deal of misrepresentation concerning the industry is made possible. Australia is a country of magnificent distances. It is practically impossible for anybody to know very much about the whole of its industries, which necessarily must be conducted under greatly varying .conditions. I have made this statement before, but it will bear repetition, in order that we may impress upon ourselves, as well as upon others, the immensity of this continent, and, therefore, its great possibilities from the point of view of production. Queensland alone comprises an area that was before the war greater than that of Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Spain, and Portugal, and yet at the present time its population is less than that of either Melbourne or Sydney. Although a. great part of its territory lies within, the tropics, Queensland possesses, owing to1 varying altitudes, practically all the climates of the whole of the States, and, therefore, ia capable of growing anything which can be produced in any part of the Commonwealth, and, in addition to products of temperate climates, it ia capable of growing all tropical products in abundance.

If this were a poor country, we would probably be left in undisturbed possession for all time; but as it is rich in actual and potential production, the day . will probably come when we shall have to fight to retain it.  Now the sugar industry is of vital importance to Queensland, and of great importance to the whole of Australia. The prosperity of my State depends, at the present time, more upon sugar-growing than upon any other industry. It represents an immense amount of capital, because, after taking into account the money invested in the sugar farms, Ave must also bear in mind the capital outlay on sugar mills and the money invested in what we may call the sugar towns,' some of which have a population of from 6,000 to 7,000 people. If the sugar industry went to the wall, most of these flourishing towns would dwindle to mere hamlets, or cease to exist . altogether. I have said that the industry is of very great importance to the Commonwealth, and, lest it be suggested that I speak with a biased mind because I have been actively engaged in the industry for the past twenty-seven years as a grower, shareholder, and for many years a director, of one of the largest co-operative mills, I purpose reading a paragraph from the report of the Royal Commission oh the sugar industry of 1911-12, appointed 'by the Fisher Government of which Sir John Gordon was for a. time chairman. He was succeeded in that position by Professor Jethro Brown, now President of the Arbitration Court in South Australia.

While the wide divergencies of opinion which exist to-day with respect to that problem are often the result of a mere ignorance of essential data, they are still more frequently the result of a failure to outgrow ideas, opinions, or policies which belong to the limited outlook of pre-Federal -times. The problem of the sugar industry to-day is not. save in subordinate respects, a problem of industry, of wealth, or of production; it is primarily and essentially a problem of settlement and defence. No nation can afford to regard lightly the development of its industries, the progress of its wealth, or the economic efficiency of its productive machinery. But, important as these things undoubtedly are, they rank, as regards the sugar industry, on mi inferior plane. The Commonwealth today is -brought face to face with one of the gravest problems which has ever taxed the ingenuity of statesmanship - that of the settlement of tropical and semi-tropical areas by a white population living under standard conditions of life. And -intimately associated with this problem is the question of national defence. If the ideal of a White Australia is to become an enduring actuality, some means must be discovered of establishing industries within the tropical regions. So long as these regions are unoccupied, they are an invitation to invasion, as well as a source of strategic weakness. Granted so much, it follows that the supreme justification for the protection of the sugar industry is .the part that the industry .has contributed, and will, as we hope, continue to contribute, to the problems of the settlement .and defence of the northern -portion of the Australian continent. The recognition of the nature of this -supreme justification is the first condition of a sound public policy in relation to the sugar industry. Relatively to it, all other issues are of minor importance.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","42","CRAWFORD, Thomas","JRW","N/A","N/A","N/A","472","The conditions to which I refer are the southeast trade winds, which prevail for nine months of the year, and the coastal range from which there is a cool land breeze practically every night of the year. I have' lived in north Queensland for twenty-seven years, and during the whole of that time I never experienced a hot night in the sense that it is known in the south. If you sleep in a well-ventilated room - and many people sleep out of doors - and if you are in good health, you wake up 'after a night's sleep thoroughly refreshed., and quite ready for a day's work. There is no doubt that north Queensland is capable of maintaining a large and healthy white population. And when one considers what a population of coloured people could be maintained there, according to the Asiatic standards of comfort, one is simply appalled. A contemplation of the .possibilities makes one more determined than ever - I speak as one who has lived in the north, and has come into contact with the coloured races - to do all that is possible to maintain the principle of a White Australia. We must not fail to realize the effect, that an invasion of coloured peoples would have upon the future of the Commonwealth, and also, if we take a wide view of the subject, as we should, the effect that a large coloured population in Australia might have upon the history of' the world. Australia is the only country in the world in which it is possible to largely increase a purely white population. There is no portion of America in which the population is wholly white. We were told during the course of this debate 'that there are about 100,000 Japanese in Western Canada, and we know there are very large numbers of the same race in California. In the United States of America there is a negro population of 20,000,000, and, proportionately, it is1 increasing much more rapidly than the white population of that country. It is estimated that in South America the coloured population is equal to_ 40,000,000 people. Although the opinion has not been freely expressed, it has been contended in different quarters that there is a feeling of revolt on the part of the Asiatics in some parts of Asia against the domination of the white races. In Australia there is room for hundreds of millions of coloured people, and if Australia were eventually to become populated to the extent that India and China is, it is evident to every one that the coloured races would eventually dominate the whole world. I, therefore, maintain that it is npt only our duty to do all we can to maintain a White 'Australia, but it should be the aim of other countries with predominating white populations to support us in that regard.  A great deal has been said concerning the cost of the sugar industry to Australia, but similar arguments could be adduced concerning other protected industries. Following the same line of reasoning, reference could also be made to boots, shoes, clothing, textiles, and practically everything protected by the Tariff. But it is said by some that, in addition to a protective duty, the sugar-growers receive a bounty; that statement is frequently made in the press of this city in a way which amounts to misrepresentation. The sugar industry has never received a bounty in the proper sense of the term. We are told that there was an import duty of Â£6 per ton, and to that must be added a bounty of Â£3 per ton, making a total protection representing Â£9 per ton. Those who make such statements omit all reference to the Excise of Â£4 per ton which the industry had to pay.

Whatever the industry may have cost before the war - I have already pointed out that it has not cost any more in proportion to the value of its output than any other protected industry - it has been more than repaid, because, not only did Australia have comparatively cheap sugar from 1914 onwards, but, with the exception of two or three occasions when shipping was held up owing to strikes, it had a bounteous supply.

I do not wish to be misunderstood. I am not making any complaints concerning the price we have received for our product during the war period. The sugar-growers had no desire whatever to join the ranks of the profiteers, although during that time they carried on their industry under very great difficulties, one of which was occasioned by the large number of enlistments from the sugar districts, as practically all the growers sons who were eligible enlisted, and so did the best of the workers. The very first men Australia sent abroad were from the sugar districts of Northern  Queensland, and I was present in Cairns when the Kanowna left with 1,500 Northern Australians on board, for, I think, Thursday Island. Shortly after, other contingents of Queenslanders, large numbers of whom were drawn from the sugar-growing districts, left for other parts. In regard to the prices paid for raw sugar during the war, commencing with 1914, we received in the first year Â£14 15s. per ton, which was Â£1 7s. 6d. less than the average price received during the three years preceding the outbreak of hostilities. It so happened that, owing to the heavy production, in Java, particularly, the price of sugar dropped early in July, and war was declared with Germany on 4th August, 1914. The State tribunals in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia kept the price of sugar down to the low rate which was then ruling, although they allowed increases in the prices of almost all commodities produced in the south. The price received for raw sugar in 1914-15 was Â£14 l5s. per ton; in 1915-16, Â£18; 1916-17, Â£18; 1917-18, Â£21; 1918-19, Â£21; and in 1919-20, Â£21. Since the present agreement the price has been Â£30 6s. 8d. Those rates were for raw sugar, known as 94 per cent. net titre.

The sum of Â£6 10s. Sd. per ton brings the cost of a ton of 96 per cent, sugar in its refined state to Â£37 10s. per ton, but a ton of 100 per cent, refined sugar is not obtained from a ton of 96 per cent, sugar, and, in addition, there are certain losses in the process of refining. The cost of a ton of refined sugar delivered to retailers in the metropolitan area, or at the railway or f.o.b., is Â£39 per ton, and that is what the industry receives. That amount includes the refiners' profits, which under the agreement is limited to 20s. per ton, and has also to cover depreciation on refining plant. I should say that means a net profit to the refinery of 15s. per ton, and seeing that the average consumption per head in Australia is about 1 cwt. per annum, it means that the profit of the refinery amounts to 9d. per capita of the population. If the refineries would give the people the free use of their plant and their working capital, amounting to Â£8,000,000 or Â£9,000,000, each of us would get our sugar for 9d. a year less than it costs us at present, supposing, of course, that the distributers would be prepared to pass that 9d. on to the consumers.  We hear a great deal about the enormous profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Senator Wilson said that they had paid a dividend of 17$ per cent., but any one can see that, as they make only 15s. per ton, or 9d. per cwt., on all the sugar they refine, a very little inefficiency here or there in the course of their business would eliminate the whole of their profit. I venture to say that there is no business of any kind in Australia that is run more efficiently than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in all its departments. We have to remember in considering the position of that company that it is not a business1 of mushroom growth, like some that exist to-day in the Commonwealth. There is a retail- drapery business in Bourke-street, Melbourne, established, I understand, twenty years ago, which, a few weeks ago, issued 300,000 9 per cent, preference shares. This is a business of mere mushroom growth as compared with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which was established in 1843. It was not established under the same name that it bears to-day, but it was somewhere in the 1850's that the name was changed to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Sir Edward Knox took over the management of the business, and he or his son managed it until twelve months ago, when the latter retired from the position of general manager and became chairman of directors. He was succeeded in his former position by Mr. Rothe.

D. Millen stated last night, by way of interjection, when Senator Wilson was speaking, that the whole of the profits of the company have not been made in Australia, but part of them have been drawn from their Fiji and New Zealand businesses. Some time in the eighties the Colonial Sugar Refining Company took over the business known as the Victoria Sugar Company, and paid the shareholders with Colonial Sugar Refining Company shares, but the shareholders in the Victoria Sugar Company had to provide Â£400,000 to cover the losses of that company, chiefly in the refining business. This shows that money may be lost, as well as made, in refining sugar. Senator Glasgow can bear me out when I say that Â£500,000 was lost by the original owners of the Millaquin Company, and that when the Queensland National Bank took over the concern they (had to write, off as mortgagees a sum of Â£300,000. As showing how flourishing the industry is, and what immense fortunes are made out of it, it may be mentioned that the Millaquin shares to-day can be bought at under paf. I think the last quotation was Â£9 5s. for Â£10 shares. Then there is Fairymead, -which is one of the best-managed sugar concerns in Queensland, and is growing cane on a rich soil and doing business in a big way. Â£1 shares in that company are quoted on the Exchange at from 17s. to 18s., and I saw in the last report of the Melbourne Stock Exchange that odd lots of them had been sold at 15s. The company had a good year last year, and paid 12 per cent., but the year before it paid no dividend at all. Such facts, I think, should be a complete reply to what has been said regarding the financial position of the industry. In the Stock Exchange of Melbourne Official List of Quotations and Sales for the month of June, I find that a number of banks have paid dividends of 10 per cent., 13 per cent., 15 per cent, (the Union Bank), and 20 per cent. (Western Australian Bank). Nobody ever says anything about the profits which these banks make. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a very important institution, and so are the banks; but why is it wrong for a big industrial organization, whose activities cover the whole of the Commonwealth, to paf 12$ per cent.. .Dart of which is made outside Australia, while it is perfectly right and' legitimate for our banks to pay up to 20. per cent.?

I think that the paid-up capital of the company is Â£3,250,000, and that Â£2,750,000 was actually paid by the shareholders, who now number about 3,000. The reserves are supposed to be at least equal to the disclosed capital. The reserves are the accumulation of some seventy years. We know the acquisitive powers of money. A very small sum set aside seventy years ago would today be represented by a very large sum. Public companies have set aside, and ought to be encouraged to set aside, to a reserve, a reasonable amount every year, because it is the tendency in Australia, and all over the world, for business to be carried on by public companies and corporations. To meet the natural expansion of business more and more capital has to be provided, and surely the most reasonable way to provide it is for the company to set aside a small sum every'year. They have a right to receive a return upon the money set aside in that way - just as much right as they have to receive a return from money actually subscribed by the shareholders.  There is no* difference, so far as I can see, in this respect, between the conduct of a public company and a private firm. If a man starts with a few hundred pounds and increases it, after some years, to a few thousands invested in his business, we think it is to his credit. Is it not just as much to the credit of a public company when the same thing takes place? That is what happened with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and with the banks, and it happens with most of the concerns that are run by public companies, not only in this country, but throughout the world. For an increase in business you must have an. increase in capital, and the business of Australia can only expand in proportion to the amount of money that is put into it.

Comparing the figures which it is stated that the Commonwealth has paid with the prices paid by the British Royal Commission on the sugar industry, one is bound to say that, considering all the circumstances, the Commonwealth bought prudently and well. The British Commission's second report shows that in 1920. when the Commonwealth paid high prices for sugar purchased abroad, this Commission bought sugar at prices ranging from Â£49, which was the lowest, up to Â£87 per ton. Other prices paid were Â£50, Â£55, Â£58, Â£65, and Â£78. For 200,000 tons of white sugar from Mauritius, up to Â£95 per ton was paid.

We know quite well that we must pay a price that will enable the sugar to be grown by white labour, and we are willing to do this.' In so far as the Australian market is concerned, it does not matter to us what price we pay for sugar.  As regards the export market, we are absolutely in agreement with the motion that was passed at your meeting giving effect- to your expression of opinion concerning rebates on imported sugar required for manufacturing purposes, and re-exported in manufactured form. An arrangement such as this would undoubtedly be of very great assistance to the , Australian fruit-growers to-day. There is no doubt that, in our opinion (and here, again, we agree with your remarks], much of the present depression in the fruit industry has been caused by over-production, fostered to a great extent by the Governments of the various States in settling returned soldiers and others on the land. We are quite sure that, at the present moment, more fruit is being produced than can be consumed in Australia at prices that will provide a decent living for the producer. We do not' ask more than that sugar for export purposes be supplied at a rate in accordance with the world's parity, or that a rebate be made on sugar re-exported, so as to enable the surplus fruit which is now being produced in Australia to be sent abroad in the shape of jam. Tfe would be glad of the assistance of your Association in bringing this about in accordance -with your resolution. We do not know that there is any market in the world that is as good and as constant as the Australian market. The Australian market for canned fruits and jams is an exceedingly good one, considering the small population of Australia. But, good as it is, at the present moment there is undoubtedly an over-supply due to the cause already mentioned. Bad as things are in Australia, they arc evidently - from cabled reports - very much worse in America, where, from latest advices, canned fruits are selling at 2s. per dozen for standard quality. The price of dessert fruit, by the way, is not influenced to any extent by the price of sugar, since only a small portion of sugar enters into the manufacturing of dessert fruits. We mention this as typical of the all-round slump that is at present being felt everywhere in the world.

They grow it there to-day in practically the same way as they did a century ago. Ours is the only white-grown cane sugar in the world, and honorable senators must bear in mind that the Australian production is very small compared to the world's production of sugar.  I was saying that when the price of sugar is discussed in its relation to the* fruit industry, it seems to be assumed that the whole of the fruit produced in Australia is either converted into jam or is canned. I find that in 1920 the total value of the fruit production of Australia was Â£5,819.045.' Of that amount, apples represent Â£1,609,200; bananas, Â£496,287;- . lemons, Â£185,372; pineapples, Â£199,470;- pears, Â£332,858; and oranges, Â£1,031,018. These are fruits which are not made into* jam to any great extent; and we have it on the authority of Sir Henry Jones that, so far as the canning industry is concerned, the quantity of sugar used is so small that the price is not a material consideration. Before the war the export of commodities containing sugar was very small indeed. From a table I received from the Trade and Customs Department, 1 find that from the 1st July, 1914, to 31st December, 1921, products containing sugar were exported from Australia to the value of Â£17,772,129. The amount is made up as follows: - Condensed milk, sweetened, Â£6,820,688, and it should be' borne in mind that there is 40 per cent, of sugar in this article. Biscuits accounted for Â£1,763,945; confectionery, Â£624,425; canned fruit, Â£1,957,569; and jams and jellies, Â£6,605,502. I venture to say that if it had not been that sugar could be obtained in abundant supply at a very reasonable price, there would never have been anything like such a large export of jams and jellies, and the other commodities containing sugar referred to, as there was'. It is not to be expected that the export trade will continue in the same proportions, because a very large part of the trade covered by the figures I have given was made up of orders from the Allied and American Governments. They bought condensed milk, jams, and canned fruits in very large quantities. I remember reading in official documents published in the press of orders for 20,000,000 lbs. and 30,000,000 lbs. of these commodities. I believe that one order from the Government of the United States of America was for no less than 38,000,000 lbs. in a single year. It is said that owing to the high price of sugar, and the consequent high price of jams, there has been a reduced consumption of jams in Australia, and also of canned fruit. A report recently published by the New South Wales Government deals somewhat extensively with the effect of the price of sugar on the fruit industry. As my time is limited, I shall not quote at length from the report. The Select Committee, which was appointed to inquire into the conditions and prospects of the agricultural industry and the methods of improving the same, consisted of ten members of the New South Wales Legislative Council, presided over by Sir Joseph Carruthers. A very serious mistake was made in the report, as will be seen from the following statement on page 101 - ","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[35]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Assuming that it cost Â£28 per ton at Leeton factory, that is to say, 3d. per lb., there is only i lb. of sugar to each 2-lb. tin of canned fruit, so the cost of sugar would represent only fd. per tin,, or 9d. per dozen tins. That could not make any appreciable difference to production costs. If the factory had got the sugar for nothing, it would only have reduced the cost of production by 9d. per dozen tins. The fundamental mistake made by the Select Committee was in assuming erroneously that, for canning purposes, sugar and fruit are used in equal weights. In another section of the report, the Committee stated that nearly the whole of the fruit grown in the Mumimbidgee area was either, canned, or dried; not used for' jam making at all.

The Select Committee, arguing upon the erroneous assumption as to the quantity of sugar required for canning fruits, declared that the cost of the output was unnecessarily high, and that, as a consequence, canned fruits were not consumed in anything like the quantity that might be expected. But the trade in dried fruits has ' increased very largely in recent years. It is very much cheaper for householders to buy evaporated fruit, 1 lb. of which, I understand, is equal to about 5 lbs. of green fruit. If they buy fruit in that form, they will not demand so much canned fruit, nor will they consume such a considerable quantity of jam. [Extension of time granted.']  After devoting a good deal of space in their report to the disabilities under which the fruit industry labours owing to the price of sugar, the Committee quoted the opinion of a grower of apples with very little justification, because comparatively little jam is made from that class of fruit. This grower stated that he was not doing very well owing to the high cost of production, because prices of almost everything he required in his business, had increased by about 100 per cent.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","113","CRAWFORD, Thomas","JRW","N/A","N/A","N/A","480","That is so; but the sugar consumed in New Zealand' was grown by cheap coloured labour in Fiji, and surely it is worth something to us to keep in the Commonwealth all the money that otherwise would have gone to other countries for the purchase of sugar. The fact that we were able to get. the sugar here meant the keeping of something like Â£50,000,000 within the Commonwealth.  As I have said, the industry did not ask for control in the first instance, and we would have been perfectly satisfied to have adopted the world's parity during the war period. We did not, however, hear anything concerning world's parity so long as it was higher than the Australian price; but now world's parity is lower than the price ruling in Australia there is scarcely an issue of the Melbourne papers which does not make some comment upon current prices. As the sugar producers did not participate in the very high prices which ruled in the world's markets for a number of years, we have a right to ask for protection against the disastrous effects which the low prices have produced in the world's sugar markets.What has happened? The President of the United States of America refused to exercise the authority given him by an Act of Congress passed towards the end of 1919, under which the whole of the Cuban output might have been purchased at a reasonable price - slightly more than that now paid for the Australian product. The consequence was that prices immediately began to rise and continued to do so throughout the whole of 1920, reaching as high as Â£137 per ton. Then, partly owing to the action of the FederalReserve Banks, of which there are twelve in the United States of America, which curtailed advances to other banks, of which there are some 30,000, the deflation of prices in America rapidly followed. Moreover, the British Royal Commission purchased 500,000 tons less than in the previous year; so that, in 1921, owing to. decreased consumption, there was a surplus of 1,000,000 tons of sugar in Cuba, which resulted in bringing down the price to about one half the cost of production. There are a number of people in Australia who thought that the same thing should happen here, although the Australian producer did not participate in high prices. In short, the industry, having served Australia so well during the war, when prices were high, should, it is suggested, have reduced prices below the cost of production, which would have meant the scrapping of the industry. In Cuba, Hawaii, and Porto Rico, which produce 5,000,000 tons, the industry is carried on by big American companies which, having made huge profits while prices were high, did what any sensible business man would have done and placed a portion of their profits into a reserve fund which enabled them to stand up during the crisis which followed. Had the producers of Queensland, who have been kept on the bread line, and a great many below it - certainly until the price was increased to Â£30 6s.8d. - suffered as the Cuban producers did during the past year, it would have ruined the industry, which would have been detrimental, not only to Queensland, but to the whole of Australia. There are some who consider that a particular industry benefits only those who are engaged in it; but that is a very narrow viewpoint to take.. Reasonable protection of an industry which produces a fair quantity at a reasonable price is of advantage to the whole community, and not only to the few engaged in it.

Reference is frequently made to the high wages paid in the sugar industry, and I know there are a number of people who consider that the one and only solution of all our industrial and economic problems is a reduction in wages. Nothing worse could happen, and Australia is under a debt of gratitude to the Commonwealth Government because they have refused to listen to that clamour for economy which would have meant a reduction in the pay of all employees in the Public Services. If the Government had economized to the extent which some thought necessary we would have had a financial panic, and the position would have been infinitely worse than it is, although it is better here than in any other part of the world. We want to keep up wages so that the purchasing power of the people will be at the highest possible point, because what is the good of high production if the masses, who are the principal consumers, have not the money to purchase the commodities they require? In such circumstances, we would in a little while have over-production as a result of under-consumption, general unemployment, and financial chaos. In considering what is to be done to stabilize the sugar industry I trust the question will receive attention from every stand-point. Notwithstanding the fact that it is carried on chiefly in one State in a somewhat remote part of the Commonwealth, the industry should receive the same consideration as it undoubtedly would if it were established in every State. Let us remember that at one time more sugar was produced from beet than from cane, and it has been said that at present conditions are favorable in all States for the production of beet sugar. But, strange to say, although the beet sugar industry has been established in Victoria for some years, it has not made any progress, notwithstanding the prevailing price of sugar, which has been considered high by those in the southern States. The Victorian Government, which owns and controls the Maffra Beet Factory, refused to put their product into the Pool, and as a consequence this product is being sold at a higher price than the Queensland people are getting for their sugar. For the information of honorable senators, I shall read the following, which was taken from one of the Melbourne papers: - ","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[41]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It would he unprofitable for the growers if this were done, involving them in a loss of about Â£14 per ton. Apart from that aspect of the question, the principle of handing the product of State activity to the Commonwealth is unwise. In most branches of primary production the producers are themselves capable of transacting their own business, and if the State Ministry is incapable of doing what it has undertaken at Maffra, and doing it profitably for the growers, it makes a sorry confession of incapacity. Mr. Oman's policy to give the producers all the profit the market will yield - restricted as it is at the present time - should meet with the approval of the beet-growers. The price is not so high as could be obtained in the world's markets, but it is now Â£49 as compared with the Â£35 the Commonwealth offers; and the price will certainly not fall for some years.

Looked at from a broad point of view, it is one of our great national assets. Up to this point I have dealt chiefly with the past, but those in the industry, and others, are naturally most concerned about the future. In these times the minds of all thinking people are directed towards the question of increased production. With increasing population we necessarily must have increased production if we are going to maintain anything like the present standard of living in Australia. The maintenance of that standard ought to he the earnest desire of every one. The sugar agreement covers the crop which is now being harvested, and the question that arises is, what is to be done, after the present agreement expires, to maintain the industry in undiminished proportions and to enable it to expand, so that no matter how rapidly our population increases the production of sugar will be able to keep pace with it?  I would like to have had time to speak comprehensively upon the advantages of Government control of the sugar industry, which is desired by the sugar producers.

Failing Government control, there is only one alternative, and that is adequate protection. At the present time the protection afforded is altogether inadequate to meet the circumstances that will obtain when the present agreement expires. The cost of production has greatly increased, as compared with what it was when a protection of Â£6 a ton was first given. Until 1912 the wages of field workers in the industry ranged from 203. to 25s. a week, and keep; in 1912, after evidence had been taken by Sir John Gordon's Commission, the wages of field workers were increased by Commonwealth regulation to 8s. per day of eight hours; and later, in June, 1914, a few weeks before the outbreak of war, the first award in the sugar industry made by the Queensland Arbitration Court came into effect, and under it the wages in the industry were fixed at from8s.8d. to 9s. 2d. per day. Wages in the north are now 17s. per day, and although there may be some reduction within the next twelve months, owing to the reduced cost of living, they, as well as other costs, must remain sub-stantially higher than they were in 1914. The same is true of other industries. To meet that increased cost, extra protection is imperative if the industry is to be maintained. The present duty is equal to less than two-thirds of a penny per lb. It must be remembered that sugar is a very costly commodity to produce. The article as placed upon the table is the result of a very technical, elaborate process, in which most expensive machinery is required. The latest mill built in Queensland, with its equipment, cost Â£500,000. Those in the industry, who have met and considered the matter in all its aspects, say that to enable them to continue to pay the same rates of wages as are paid in industries throughout Australia, and taking into account the peculiar circumstances of the industry-namely, that it is carried on in a remote part of the Commonwealth, and that employment is only seasonal - it will be necessary, if the agreement is not continued, to increase the import duty to lÂ½d. per lb., or Â£14 per ton.

Their deaths are merely a further tribute to the strenuous work that members of Parliament are called upon to perform. The nerve-racking nature of the work has the effect of very considerably impairing their health and shortening the period of their lives.  I also wish to compliment the mover of this motion upon his first effort in this Chamber. I am sure we all listened with a good deal of pleasure and interest to the honorable senator's first speech, and we have no doubt that from time to time he will be heard with interest in the Senate, and with advantage to himself as a parliamentarian. I must also take this opportunity to compliment the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) on the work that he accomplished at the Washington Conference, not only for Australia, but also for the civilized world. At any rate, we hope that the result of that gathering will have very far-reaching effects, and we are glad to know that the honorable senator, who was then the Minister for. Defence, distinguished himself so signally, notwithstanding the fact that when he left Australia there .seemed to be a conspiracy to handicap him in his work overseas. I was not here when Senator Pearce left for Washington, being at that time in the centre of Australia. Newspapers, however, reached our party from time to time, and we read more or less extensively the adverse criticisms levelled at him. 1 think it is only right and proper in this place, where we can express our opinions of those whom we know and of the work that they do, that we should enter .a protest against the press and some of the public' men of Australia for the way in which they discount Australian ambassadors who are sent overseas to do important work for this country. Some of the criticisms published in Australia of Senator Pearce must have preceded him to Washington. A less capable or a less determined man might have been very much disconcerted, but we are glad that in spite of all he was able to complete the work he was sent to do with, credit to himself and with satisfaction to the people of Australia. Some honorable senators will say that we ought not to take too much notice of what the press says. I disagree entirely with that. If such statements are allowed to go week after week and month after month uncontradicted, a very large section of the people of Australia may believe them to be true. Therefore, I take it that here, in this Senate, is the place where our protest should be entered and our appreciation of work well done recorded. A section of the press has not yet ceased its efforts to discount our public men. Looking this week at the Melbourne Age, which seems to rae to be the one paper that lays itself out to discount public life and to do its very best to undermine responsible government, we find it still making efforts to discount the work that Senator Pearce did. In last Tuesday's issue I find a column headed, 'How the money goes. Political missions abroad. Cost to the country.' Then follows a table of the various delegations that have gone from this country since 1902. The cost of those delegations is set out in bald figures, which may be right or wrong, but nothing is said of the fact that a Minister going to a conference, such as that at Washington, must take a very considerable staff with him. Any one who did not know the facts of the case would immediately assume from the newspaper criticism that the Minister mentioned in the list - the ' Trippers' Diary ' as they call it - accounted for the whole of the expenditure. Instead of that the expenditure covered the whole of the Minister's staff, and whatever professional or advisory assistance he may have required overseas. This is very carefully overlooked in the article in the Age. I protest against the unfair criticism of the work of Ministers, who are called upon more frequently nowadays than ever before to go abroad in the interests of Australia. Senator Pearce is very hopeful of the peaceful results of the work accomplished at Washington. I am not one of those who believe that lasting peace is to be expected from the Washington Conference and the previous ones. I hope I am wrong, but I am afraid that such Conferences have not altered the aggressiveness of human nature or the liability of nations to quarrel. It is quite possible that for a very slight reason a big conflagration may break out in the near future. It is the duty of Australia, and of the British Empire, not to disorganize its defence machinery as a result of the agreement reached at Washington. I am afraid that the smashing reductions recently decided upon in connexion with the Naval and Military Forces are premature. The Government yielded to the popular clamour for economy to a greater extent than they should. The scheme for retrenchment will very considerably affect the machinery created during the war period. We are now retiring many of our most distinguished soldiers, and we are cutting at the roots of the defence system. We are destroying to a great extent - if not entirely - the Military College at Duntroon, although the officers trained there have attained an enviable' reputation as good leaders. Members of the Senate yesterday listened to Senator Drake-Brockman with very great interest on this subject, because of his wide experience as a soldier. I agree with him. that if we destroy our Defence Force it will never be possible to recreate it within, the. short period that may be available in the event of a further war.

We must take our place among the nations with respect to trade, just the same as we have done in other matters. I am in favour, not only of sending a representative of Australia to the United States of America, but to other countries as well. Representatives of large interests in other countries are continually coming to Australia, and, while they may have some interest in the export of Australian goods to the countries from which they come, they are certainly much more concerned about the import to Australia of goods produced in the countries they represent. We should take our place with the other nations of the world in the endeavour to extend our export trade.  Reference is made in another paragraph of the Speech to the necessity of lightening the burdens of the taxpayers by economy in public expenditure. Every member of this Parliament is as alive to the advantage of economy as are the critics outside who level such severe criticism at this Parliament. Economy can be very easily overdone. There is, for instance, no economy in curtailing expenditure on necessary developmental work in this new country. I hope that in connexion with the proposals for the settling of people on the land and encouraging them to produce goods required by the people of this and other countries, and proposals for the construction of railways and developmental works throughout the Commonwealth, the Government will not be unduly influenced by the clamour of persons who are continually preaching economy. It is indicated in the paragraph to which I now refer that it is intended to appoint a Board of Commissioners, such as was recommended by the Economies Royal Commission, and I want to say here that I am opposed to the appointment to these Boards of persons without political responsibility. The Government and Parliament are responsible to the taxpayers for the expenditure of their money, and we should not appoint a Board of Commissioners who will be practically outside the control of Parliament as soon as they are appointed. Ministers may not agree with me on the point, but I believe that disastrous consequences have in some cases resulted from, the appointment of such Boards. If the proposed Board of Commissioners is to be appointed, it should be composed of men directly responsible to the taxpayers. It should be composed of members of the Senate or of another place, who must submit themselves every six or every three years to the electors. 'We are spending the taxpayers' money, and they should be in a position to criticise every person charged with responsibility for public expenditure. We can very well imagine what would be likely to be the effect on the development of the country generally of undue economy in a Department such as the Post and Telegraph Department. I heard some one objecting recently to the continual pleading for the man who goes out-back. But all that he wants is a fair deal. He does not think that at this time he should be left so isolated when others in the community have all the conveniences and luxuries of civilization provided for them. I have every sympathy with the man who goes out-back, and I say that up to the present time neither the Federal nor the State Governments have given him the consideration he deserves. In the early days pioneers went out-back to remote districts without much assistance from the Governments of the day. But times have changed since then; large cities have grown up, and the lure of the large city has now to be reckoned with. If men are to be lured away from the cities to undertake the work of pioneering in remote districts it is certainly the duty of Parliament to see that they shall be provided, not with the luxuries, but with some of the necessary conveniences of civilized life. A curtailment of the expansion of the facilities provided by the Post and Telegraph Department must have a very disastrous effect upon the advance of settlement in Australia. I know of persons in the State I represent who certainly think, if they do not openly complain, that, not only the present, but previous Federal Governments have not given them the consideration they had a right to expect. I am glad in the circumstances to find that the authorities of the Post and Telegraph Department are determined to extend to outlying districts of Australia, facilities now provided for people in the more thickly populated centres only. In this connexion I hope that the financial arrangements of this important Department will be placed on a more satisfactory basis. I understand that in the past, if the Postmaster-General has had unexpended balances in hand at the close of the financial year, they have all gone into the revenue again, and he has had to suspend his operations in the extension of telegraphic and telephonic facilities until money has again been voted for the operations of his Department. Under the existing system, a considerable interval very often elapses before his votes for necessary works are replenished, and he often finds himself in the position that he is able to expend not more than half of the votes for the financial year. As a result of this system of financing the Department, there is a continual suspension of works. I hope that in future, whatever money the Postmaster-General has unexpended at the end of the financial year will be transferred to a fund upon which he can draw in order that he may be in a position to continue the work of his Department without interruption all the year round. Since we last met, the members of the Public Works Committee have investigated a good many alterations and improvements which the Post and Telegraph Department has in hand in the large cities. Manual telephone exchanges are being replaced by automatic exchanges, and the appliances so displaced in the cities are being sent to the country districts. In order to equip large automatic exchanges, there must be a continuous importation of necessary appliances for some years, and unless funds are provided for the Post and Telegraph Department under a system different from that adopted in the past, it will be impossible to carry out works that are urgently required. In many of our cities the manual exchanges* have become so crowded that it is impossible to extend the telephone service with them, and the Government are wisely providing automatic exchanges for Australia, as is being done in almost every other country in the world.

The first way is that suggested, perhaps naturally, by large private shipping interests, and that is that the Government should sell their ships to a syndicate or shipping company in any part of the world. It is certain that the big shipping companies would, for various reasons, be very glad to buy the Commonwealth vessels, for if these ships were registered in some overseas port, perhaps in China, they could be manned with black or yellow crews.

The Commonwealth Government ought to stiffen their backs, and, in spite of all opposition and interference by the Seamen's Union, should continue to run the vessels on business-like lines. Seamen employed on the Commonwealth ships have better accommodation, are better paid, and better provided for than are seamen on ships sailing from any other ports in the world. As soon as the Commonwealth ships reach Sydney Harbor, where the crews are paid off, there is a rush to sign on for the new voyage; but as often as not union officials, in some cases men who cannot speak the English language, go aboard and persuade these foolish seamen not to sign the articles. I have no doubt that the arm of the Commonwealth law is long enough and strong enough to reach these agitators, and the sooner action is taken the better it will be for all concerned.  Another reason why control of Commonwealth ships should continue in the hands of the Government is that at Cockatoo Island Dockyard there are repair works second to none in Australia. I know that many failures have been attributed to the dockyard, and that the management has not always been what it should be; but at present the Cockatoo Island Dockyard is being managed effi- cientlyand effectively. It is said that the dockyard is competing with private businesses in Sydney. But what real objection can be urged to any competition so long as fair prices are charged? And I understand that is being done. A little while ago I had the privilege of visiting the dockyard, and was very much impressed with its splendid equipment for repair work. To insure efficiency it is essential that the staff should be kept together, and this can only be done by a continuity of work, because you cannot discharge shipyard men this week and re-engage them next week. The work must be continuous, otherwise the staff will drift away and become disorganized. The Government are quite within their rights in competing with any other dockyard, so long as proper prices are charged and unfair undercutting is not resorted to. It has occurred to me that some little economy might be possible if the Government came to some arrangement to prevent the duplication of ship repair work at Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the Naval Dockyard at Garden Island. There is no earthly reason why repair work now carried out at Garden Island should not be done at Cockatoo Island.

I de- sire to approach this matter with quite an open mind; I have no desire to express any definite opinion one way or the other, though personally I am rather against unification because of the tremendous expense it would entail on Australia at the present time. In my opinion, there is not the necessity for unification that several honorable senators suggest. On several occasions we have been told of great in convenience entailed on passengers who do the journey from Perth to Brisbane; and it is worth while to inquire whether that inconvenience exists to the extent suggested. When the Transcontinental Line was built, the Western Australian Government had, more or less, definitely decided to widen their railway from Kalgoorlie to Perth. No Act in contemplation of such work has yet been passed, but I may say that it is now suggested in Western Australia that if a new line were constructed it would be taken by a different route. If the Commonwealth Government and the Western Australian Government were to agree that any new line constructed between Perth and Kalgoorlie should be on the 4-ft. 8Â½in. gauge, that would get over the gauge difficulty at that end; and it seems to me that that is what the Western Australian people have in mind. There would then be a clear run without break of gauge from Perth to Port Augusta. It is suggested, and I believe negotiations have taken place between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian Government with this end in view, that there shall be another line constructed from Port Augusta to Adelaide which could, of course, be on the same gauge. As a matter of fact, I think that the South Australian Government are already building a portion of that line on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge; but it might be arranged between the Governments to adopt a gauge that would afford a clear run from Perth to Adelaide. I may say here that, in my opinion, that is about as far as a train should run continuously. A train cannot be run for thousands of miles without a break - a fact which all railway managers recognise.

I do not wish it to be thought that a speed of 60 miles per hour is usual, because the average rate is about 45 miles per hour. The locomotives used weigh 130 tons, the rails are 80 lbs. to the yard, the track is laid in such a way that it is perfectly safe; and I believe that similar narrow-gauge lines would suit in many parts of Australia for at least 100 years. On the South African railways they are using engines up to 180 tons on80-lb. rails, hauling 1,600 tons on a ruling grade of 1 in 100. The passenger locomotives weigh 134 tons, and haul very heavy loads on a grade of 1 in 80. The rails used weigh 80 lbs. per yard, and the trains take curves of a 4Â½-chain radius.  During the trip to Java of a section of the Public Works Committee exhaustive inquiries were made into the possibility of securing additional trade with the East, and our investigations proved that a tremendous increase in trade with Java, Singapore, and eastern countries generally, was possible. The SubCommittee presented a report to the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) containing the information acquired, and since that report was published greater activity in securing Eastern trade has been shown in Australia than during any previous period. I do not suggest that our report had anything to do with recent activities, but since it was published Trade Commissioners have been appointed by the Western Australian and South Australian Governments,and in Melbourne a large company has been formed, consisting of manufacturers, who are opening up extensive business with Shanghai. The Federal Government have also appointed Mr. Sheaf as a Federal Trade Commissioner, and doubtless his efforts will be the means of Australia securing more business in the countries I have mentioned.

When Senator Thomas was speaking the other day, he suggested that the Government should in future refrain from submitting the construction of works at Canberra to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report, as such a procedure was largely responsible for delays which have taken place. When such a charge is made specific instances of delay should be given; but the honorable senator did not do that. I do not know of any instance in which the construction work at Canberra has been delayed in consequence of investigations made by the Committee; but the Committee has been responsible for saving large sums of money on work which has been undertaken there, and the Committee cannot be blamed for whatever reckless expenditure has been incurred at Canberra. The Committee, which is appointed by Parliament, consists of members of both Houses, and is really the watchdog of the public purse in the interests of the people. When an inquiry is being conducted plans and estimates are submitted by responsible officers, and the Committee is always on the alert to see where savings can be effected. The recommendations of this body are published in the reports which are brought before Parliament, and which are always available to honorable senators. It is somewhat difficult for a member of the Committee to speak as I am doing; but it appears that it is only members of that body who have an intimate knowledge of its work, and who are able to refer in detail to the numerous proposals considered from time to time. In some cases its recommendations have not been carried out; and during a recent visit to Sydney we were informed of what had occurred at the Mobilization Stores, at Leichhardt. We visited the store, and found that our recommendations had been deliberately departed from, although exhaustive inquiries had been made. The store at Leichhardt is perhaps one of the best of its kind in the Commonwealth, and after the closest investigation the Committee recommended that three lifts be placed on each side of the building. Our recommendation, however, was ignored, and the six lifts were placed in the centre of the structure, which reduced its usefulness by 25 per cent. Those who are responsible for the alteration can now see that a mistake has been made, and it is one which they very much regret. I therefore trust that in future the recommendations of the Committee will be carried out; and if that is done, they will always be prepared to take the responsibility. I also wish to refer to the construction of a note-printing office, the report in connexion with which was submitted to Parliament two or three years ago. After exhaustive inquiry as to whether the establishment should be erected in Melbourne, Sydney, or Canberra, the Committee ultimately reported in favour of a building estimated to cost Â£46,800 being erected on a site behind Parliament House. When we went into the question of constructing a similar building at Canberra, with the necessary contingencies, it was found that the cost would have been Â£186,265, as against Â£46,800 in Melbourne. In that report we show that we saved Â£1,000 by making certain alterations in the floors of the building. I find that since the report was furnished the Commonwealth Bank has taken over the note-printing business, and are preparing plans at considerable cost, and calling for tenders. They are ignoring the -whole of the work of the Public Works Committee. We went into the question of plans and quantities, and to what extent portions of the old building could be saved and used for the new building. This report has been scrapped by the Bank authorities, who are now calling for fresh tenders to their own design. Parliament has not a word to say in controlling the Commonwealth Bank. I ask this Chamber whether it is a fair thing, after having appointed the Works Committee to inquire into these things, to ignore the Committee's report in this way?

Kirkpatrick, are called upon to prepare plans which will cost the people of Australia up to Â£5,000, notwithstanding the fact that plans filed in the Works andRailways Department are already in existence, and that everything is ready for going on with the work.  There is one other matter to which I wish to refer in connexion with another work which has been withdrawn from the Public Works Committee. Some years ago, the Committee investigated a proposal to construct a railway from the main line in New South Wales to Tuggeranong, in the Federal Capital Territory, where it was proposed to erect an arsenal. The railway was recommended, but nothing further was done regarding the arsenal. Now I understand that portions of the arsenal are being erected at Maribyrnong. Several small buildings in connexion with it have already been built, and there is a Government Gazette notice, of the 13th July, withdrawing from the Public Works Committee, in accordance with the Public Works Committee Act, instructions to inquire into a certain further building to be erected in connexion with the arsenal. By-and-by, in a few years' time, or perhaps sooner, the question of the construction of this arsenal may be referred to the Committee. What choice will the Committee have if the building has already been partly erected piecemeal in this way? When it comes to deciding the question of the best site, the Committee will be tied down to this particular one, no matter how unsuitable it may be. I know that certain secret works for Defence purposes may be withdrawn from the Committee, but I fail to see that there is any need for secrecy in connexion with the erection of an arsenal. The Gazette notice says - In pursuance of the. Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913, the Governor-General in Council has approved of the public . work known as the Explosive and Filling Factories, being a work for the naval or military defence of the Commonwealth, being exempted from the operation of the Act. I could understand a question of fortifications being withdrawn where absolute secrecy might be advisable, butIfail to see why this work should be constructed piecemeal and taken away from the Public Works Committee. I am not dealing with this from a personal point of view, for my term on the Works Committee will soon expire, but after six years as a member of it I have a great appreciation of the valuable work it has done. I feel that the Government are doing something unfair in this matter. Somewhat similar tactics were adopted by a previous Postmaster-General, who divided a job into two or three parts so as to bring the expenditure under Â£25,000. I think he spent two sums of Â£15,000, the object being to prevent the Public Works Committee inquiring into it.
