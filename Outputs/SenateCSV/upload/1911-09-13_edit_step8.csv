That question is answered by the Prime Minister himself in the first portion of the statement that I read, where he said that when any portion of the Empire is at war the whole Empire is de facto at war. But what was in the mind of the Prime Minister when in the very next breath he made a limitation to the effect that in consequence of the autonomous powers exercised by the Dominions it will be for them, through their Governments, to say whether they will actively participate in any war in which the Empire may be concerned? It is not less vital to the Mother Country than to ourselves that those questions should be answered in clear and unmistakable terms. I venture to make the statement that we are voting these millions - and I suppose we shall be asked to vote more - for naval and military purposes in order that if the Empire becomes engaged in war our forces shall be an integral portion of the forces which will co-operate for- the preservation of the integrity of the Empire.

The fact, however, is that no part of the Empire can have relations with foreign Powers in which the rest of the Empire is not concerned, unless it is prepared to face the full responsibility of a diplomacy of its own. In that case it would enter the international arena with only such influence as its own resources supplied.

Now that we are building up our Naval and Military Forces - now that that process is in its infancy - it is only right that we should have an early declaration of the express purpose for which those Forces are being established. More than one portion of the speech delivered by the Prime Minister makes it clear that he recognises the obligation of the Commonwealth, as an integral part of the Empire, and that he appreciates keenly our duty in regard to that Imperial relation. It was not until he came into personal contact with his own colleagues that he qualified that doctrine by a comment which is capable of a dangerous and most disastrous application. When the Minister of Defence asks Parliament to vote more millions of pounds for the building up of our Army and Navy, honorable senators upon this side of the chamber will require, on behalf of the country, an unqualified expression as to what is to be the military and naval policy of the Government.

I now propose to deal in a cursory fashion with some of the important items which were alluded to by the Minister of Defence in the course of his reply to the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition. The Minister, in referring to the incidence of the Federal land tax, affirmed that until the near approach of the imposition of that tax there was not much room for land settlement in Australia. I do not think that I have misinterpreted the substance of his reply. The only inference which one can draw from that statement is that the Federal land tax is responsible for the breaking up of large estates, which have hitherto prevented closer settlement. Surely the statement that there was no room for land settlement in Australia prior to the imposition of the tax was a whole burnt-offering on the altar of the god of clap-trap. It is evident, too, that that whole burnt-offering was a whole-hogged statement. What are the facts of the case? I have here a few figures which will speak for themselves, and which will show what was the area of land held for developmental purposes in Australia long before a land tax was thought of.

Generally speaking, the cultivation of wheat is associated with the settlement of the land in comparatively small areas.

In 1 860-1, the acreage under wheat in Australia was 643.983 acres; in 1870-1, it was 1,123,839 acres; in 1.880-1, it was 31054,305 acres; in 1 900- 1. it was 5.115,965 acres; and in 1909-10. it was 6.586,236.

So far they ha 'is been deluded by the hypocritical cry that the land tax will break up large estates. In at least nineteen-twentieths of the cases the tax cannot do so, because the estates on which it operates are so closely settled thai further breaking up is impossible. It may follow that, in some isolated instances, a large holding, being subject to the operation of the tax, is in course of transition. But supposing that that is the case, who is going to pay the tax? If a large holder transfers his land to a small holder, the small holder will take the land with the tax, so that the transferror shall not bear the imposition, and the terms will in nearly all cases be so arranged that the small holder will pay not only the capital value of the land, but every penny of the land tax. There is no royal road to taxation, and it will not take much longer, I think, for the people of Australia to understand that the last thing which an honest Government should do if it desires not to increase the burdens of the country, is to impose taxes of any kind, and never to impose them except in cases of necessity, because, if ill-regulated, the worker will suffer all the time.

We cannot escape from the fact that this boasted land tax is falling to-day on the backs of the workers as tenants. If my honorable friends want to get hold of big estates, and such estates are really preventing settlement, there are other ways of dealing with the matter. What the Government has done in this case in order to get a few cracklings foi; themselves, has been to burn down the whole house. A paragraph of the opening Speech refers to the consolidation of the State debts. I am not going to ladle out, if I may be pardoned for using that expression, any particular censure on the Government in this matter, because I think that every Government of the Commonwealth is justly open to like censure. The subject has not been dealt with so far, and I hope that the Ministry will be able to make good their word, and, at any rate, do something. I take it that the consolidation of the State debts, embracing at least £250,000,000, will be the biggest financial transaction which a Commonwealth Government has ever undertaken; that a satisfactory solution of the difficulty will tax the highest financial talent, not only inside Australia, but outside as well, and that it cannot be settled satisfactorily by Parliament until the whole question has been threshed out from top to bottom by a competent financial committee, capable of advising us as to the action to be taken. As soon as the matter is dealt with, in justice to the States, the better. We have already deprived the States of half of their Customs returns, which was the principal security for, and the fund for the payment of interest on, their debts; and therefore, in duty to the States, we are forced to take up the question. The only way in which it can be approached is, I think, the way in which a similar question was approached in England, when about ,£350,000,000 or £400,000,000 worth of Government stock was gradually converted into what are known as consols. The operation took about twenty or thirty years; but it was preceded and accompanied by various Acts of Parliament, and expert financial advice, both inside and outside Parliament, carefully piloted the Government through every measure necessary to carry out that gigantic financial transaction. In a similar way. we must deal with this £250,000,000 worth of stock. I hope that the Government will at once appoint a competent Royal Commission, and, if possible, not allow the consideration of the question to be delayed a day longer. On the matter of policy, I express this opinion, which I have frequently expressed elsewhere, that, in the taking over or the consolidation of the State debts, I shall be no party to any policy which would interfere with future borrowing by them. In support of that opinion, I can quote the advice given by the Agent-General for New South Wales in 1909, when the question of consolidation and the future policy to be observed was being spoken of in this Parliament, and indirectly in the State Parliaments. It has been contended here and elsewhere, over and over again, by political and financial leaders of far higher standing and authority than I would presume even to think myself to be, that you cannot approach this big financial operation without restricting the borrowing powers of the States. I have differed, and, in the light of information which I possess, I shall continue to differ from those persons. The matters seems to me to be entirely distinct from one another, and, rather than see the borrowing powers of the States for the present, and for years to come restricted, I would prefer the State debts not to be touched or consolidated. ' In support of the opinion that we can separate the two questions, I shall quote the advice of the Agent- General for New South Wales, Mr. T. A. Coghlan, wired from  London on oth March, 1909, to his Premier.

The contrary is the case for equal amounts. Commonwealth could certainly borrow on better terms than could any State. Its credit could not be quite as good as Canada, but where New South Wales would obtain 99 for a 3^ per cent, loan, Commonwealth would obtain at par. The idea encouraged in Australia that where States pay 3^ per cent. Commonwealth would pay 3 per cent, is ridiculous. India, with the guarantee of the Imperial Government, borrowed recently exactly on the same terms as New South Wales, and Canada shade better, both at 3^ per cent., and underwriting cannot be avoided. Imperial Government only party able to place loan without underwriting. But though superior to individual States the Commonwealth's credit could be only maintained within narrow limits. There is no question here that the six States, acting separately, could obtain from London sums far larger than could the. Commonwealth, perhaps twice as much. This arises from strong growing tendency amongst all classes of investors to distribute investment risk. Present difficulty of States obtaining loans arises from the inability of the market to forecast the European situation, and will soon pass away. This affects even the Imperial Government, which is waiting to place loan Irish stocks.  My opinion, supported by leading financiers here, is that, if power to borrow in London be surrendered by the States to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth will find itself in difficulties when providing for renewals, and it would not be able to obtain any money for new undertakings. Axiom, ' Whole greater than the part,' is, in this instance, fallacious. You must remember that the Commonwealth inevitably will be a borrower sooner or later.

I know of nothing which materially modifies that important' opinion from a high financial authority. That the States' credit to-day is stronger than the Commonwealth's estimate of its own credit, is proved by the fact that the Queensland Government raised its last loan at about 12s. 6d. per cent, less than the rate at which the Commonwealth Government was lending money to various States.

But the States have no reason for doing so yet, because the Commonwealth has been dallying with this question year after year, talking about it and doing nothing.

Paragraph 30 of the Governor-General's Speech deals with the right of Commonwealth public servants to appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. There can, I think, be but one comment on a. proposal of that kind. It is a confession of inefficiency on the part of the Postmaster- General, and a confession of gross timidity on the part of the Government itself. If the management of the Post and Telegraph Department is such that its officers do not get fair play in the exercise of their duties as public servants the Minister is responsible for not relieving that situation through the action of Parliament.

I am not going to separate one party from another, except to say that, if the public servants of the Commonwealth are not being treated properly in the matter of salaries or wages, the Minister is not doing his duty, either to the Parliament or to the people of this country, when he does not make out a case to Parliament for an improvement of their lot. There is certainly one branch of the Post and Telegraph Department that is grossly ineffective. I allude to the Telephone branch. The reason for its ineffectiveness is that more money is required to carry it on. I believe that the Telephone branch, from the time when the Department was taken over by the Commonwealth, has never been supplied with sufficient funds for discharging its functions, if they were to be carried out effectively. We cannot expect public servants to administer the machinery of a Department properly if they have not sufficient motive power at their disposal. A report laid before Parliament some five or six years ago informed us that the Post, and Telegraph Department required some two or three million pounds to bring it up to a modern standard and to satisfy the reasonable requirements of Australia. The Government could have relieved the situation by resorting to the system which prevails iri the British Post Office. The Postmaster-General in Great Britain has been asking for some millions for the purpose of taking over the 'telephones, which have been in the hands of private companies. He proposed to finance his policy by a system of terminable annuities. In just the same way here the difficulty of extending the work of the Post and Telegraph Department could be. got over by a species of loan, which might be paid back to the Treasurer after a certain number of years. I believe that the Postmaster-General in Great Britain published a memorandum showing that he would require about £6,000,000 in order to bring the telephone system, formerly controlled by private companies, up to the standard required by the people of the United Kingdom.

If the threat of the Ministry to again submit to the people the proposals which were so decisively rejected in April last be carried into effect, it will give me the greatest pleasure, because I shall consider it my duty to once more stump the country in opposition to them. But I do not think the Government will re-submit those proposals to the people. If they do - making all the reservations that a man must make when he enters upon the field of prophecy - I think they will be soundly defeated. Further, I do not believe that the Government are game to refer them to the electors again in the form in which they were previously presented. Ministers will probably recognise that some consideration is due to the people, of whose interests they profess to be the special' guardians, by presenting them in a form which will enable the humblest, as well as the most exalted, intelligence to realize their effect. But from a statement which was made by Senator E. J. Russell, I gather that at least one of the proposals will be abandoned. That honorable senator, in championing the Minister of Defence, who charged the Opposition with having broadcasted misleading literature as to the meaning of the proposals embodied in the referenda, declared that the statement .which was contained in one pamphlet that municipalities would be robbed of their powers by the Commonwealth, was sheer nonsense. My reply was that the most eminent constitutional lawyer, in Australia held exactly the same view as that which was expressed in the pamphlet in question; and thereupon Senator E. J. Russell pointed out that Mr. Mitchell had withdrawn his original opinion on the matter, thus implying that the view which he then expressed was a wrong one. Consequently, I venture to affirm that the Government will not bring forward that proposal again. If they do, they will bring it forward in such a form as will prevent a mistake being made such as we, as well as Mr. Mitchell , are alleged to have made. There is no political party in this country which is so stupid and undemocratic as to say to the people at this stage of our political history, ' Either you did not understand the proposals referred to you in April last, or you were so corrupt that you allowed yourselves to be bribed. Because you were so unintelligent, or so corrupt, at the last referenda, we are again putting the proposals before you, hoping that you will now understand them, or that you will not allow yourselves to be corrupted by the organizations of the other side.' No Government, I repeat, dare do that. I hope that Ministers are game to do it. If they are, they will meet with the same opposition, and with a more decisive defeat than they experienced on the last occasion. I come now to the question of the establishment of a Commonwealth bank, which has been long promised by the Labour party. That promise they are bound to redeem. The reason underlying the establishment of this institution was well explained in less than a sentence by the great financial authority on the other side of the Chamber - I refer to Senator Needham. He put into less than a sentence the whole object of the financial policy of nineteen-twentieths of the supporters of the Federal Labour party, and, indeed, of the Labour party throughout Australia, when he said that the object of establishing a Commonwealth bank was to provide the people with cheaper money. In framing such a measure, 1 believe that the Government entertain the delusion that they can provide the country with cheap money. But no fact is more clearly established historically than that Governments cannot make money cheap.

But, after twenty years of experimenting in this matter, we are again confronted with the need for a further amendment of existing legislation, presumably in the interests alike of the workers and of the employers. If there .be one thing more than another which Australia requires to-day, it is industrial peace. We have already provided the machinery for bringing about industrial peace, but, if the desire of the unionists or employes is not in that direction, all our Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts are in vain. It is the duty of every representative of the people, and of every employer and employe to do his utmost to insure that the instrument that we have designed to secure industrial peace in Australia is not converted into an instrument for industrial warfare.

There are but two or three subjects to which I desire to refer very briefly. The .first is the result of the referenda decided in Australia on the 26th April last. There has been great jubilation in this and in another place, as well as outside Parliament, on the part of members of the party opposite at the result of the referenda. It was stated no later than yesterday in another place, by a very prominent Conservative, that the Labour party should have taken it so much to heart that the Government should have immediately resigned and allowed the representatives of the minority to occupy the Treasury benches. I am in no way downcast by the result of the referenda. The members of the Labour party can congratulate themselves that they still remain the reform party. It is characteristic of all reform parties that their proposals are so far ahead of the views of the majority that it takes a few years for the people generally to catch up with them. I am satisfied that the next time the proposals for effecting alterations of the Constitution are submitted to the people they will, as the result of bitter experience, have been taught the urgent necessity of answering 'Yes,' to them, and giving this Parliament the power we asked for at the referenda. The result was a pretty well foregone conclusion if we take into consideration the extraordinary amount of money spent in opposition to them, and the more than extraordinary amount of misrepresentation that was indulged in. The people were grossly deceived as to the effects which would follow if they answered ' Yes ' to the questions put to them. It was repeatedly stated in this and in another place, as well as outside Parliament, that no people should give to any Parliament the power which this party asked them to give the Federal Parliament. Those who used that argument merely advertised their own - utter stupidity, because, although the people declined to give that power to the Federal Parliament, they still left it in the hands of every State Parliament, where it can be exercised, not at the will of the people's representatives, but at the will of the representatives of ' Fat ' in nominee Upper Houses, responsible to nobody, or, as in some States, in Upper Houses responsible only to a small section of the community. We hear a great deal about industrial strife and unrest, and we have just listened to a plea by Senator St. Ledger for industrial peace. But I remind the honorable senator that there are several things which are much more valuable than peace. I should, no doubt, be a very peaceable and harmless individual if I lay down and allowed other people to use me as a footstool or a door-mat, but I say that a people who will permit themselves to be used in that way are too contemptible to have any consideration given to them at all. When we hear all these references to strikes and industrial unrest, it is curious that the only strikes alluded to are the efforts of the workers to secure an increased price for the commodity they have to sell, namely, their labour. There is not a single word in denunciation of the wealthy and mighty corporations when they go on strike. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, within the last month or six weeks, has struck three times. It has asked another £i per ton each time for its sugar, but there has not been a single word of denunciation of that strike against the whole of the people of Australia. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company demanded an increased price for the commodity it has to sell, and refused to supply anybody unless it got it. When the worker demands a little increased price for the commodity he has to sell - his labour - and refuses to supply it on any other conditions, he is immediately denounced; we are told that there is industrial war, that the country is going to die dogs, and every one is going to be ruined. There is not a single word of condemnation for the great commercial strikes which are against the general public all the time. I am satisfied that most people in Australia have been convinced by the action of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,, during the last month or two, that it is absolutely necessary to give to the Commonwealth Parliament the powers for the regulation and control of monopolies which we asked from them at the last referendum. I am certain that if the questions were put to them again, the people, voting in the light of the experience they have recently gained, would emphatically answer ' Yes ' to them.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","176","GIVENS, Thomas","KLS","N/A","N/A","N/A","339","Not only has the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, owing to the position of advantage which it occupies through being a monopoly, gone on strike against the people of Australia three times during the last five or six weeks by putting up the price of sugar by £1 per ton on each occasion, but it has also gone on strike against other important manufacturing industries. There are other manufacturing industries to which sugar is largely a raw material. Consequently, these manufacturers were considerably retarded in the conduct of their business by having to pay extortionately high prices for their sugar. Not only did this company exact these extortionate terms, but it also put forward a claim on its customers which should not be tolerated by any free people, and that is that they must buy every particle of sugar which they use in their business from or through the company, otherwise they will not be served on these terms at all. This corporation occupies a position which is, I think, very much worse. During the last few months we have had what Senator St. Ledger would call a very disastrous piece of industrial warfare in the sugar industry. It is a very curious fact, which is known to him as well as to any other gentleman acquainted with the position in Queensland, that for at least twenty years we listened to the howl of those engaged in the sugar industry to the effect that white men could not work in cane-fields in the tropics at all. That was the great cry of the black-labour people who were interested in the sugar industry at that time, and for twenty years, in season and out of season, it was dinned into our ears. During the last strike, however, what was the cry? The cry was that the eight hours per day which we in Australia pride ourselves upon having adopted as a reasonable standard for a day's work was ridiculous, and that these men should work from ten to twelve hours per clay in the tropics, where the black labour people formerly howled that white men could not work at all. The astonishing thing, to any reasonable, fair-minded man, in regard to that strike, is that it was necessary to have a strike at all in order to obtain such eminently fair and reasonable conditions as 30s. per week and tucker and eight hours per day in Australia, or, as an alternative, 42s. per week without tucker - that is, a miserable 7s. per day. Yet it was necessary for the men to enter upon a long continued strike in order to obtain these meagre terms. I think it is beyond the bounds of possibility for anybody to say that their demands were in any way excessive, and it was particularly strong, for those who formerly said that white men could not work in the tropics at all, to refuse to agree to a working day of eight hours. Were it not for the fact that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company dominates the whole position, that strike would not have been necessary, and for more than one reason. In the first place, the fact that the company dominates the whole position made private mill-owners and private growers afraid to go against its wishes in the matter, and it has always been a notorious sweater, a notorious employer of coloured labour at every place at which it could possibly employ them.

I may have a word or two to say about the possibility of appointing a Commission before I have finished, but at present I am dealing with the position which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company occupies in the sugar industry in Queensland. My advices from that State are that the private growers were mostly in favour of granting the men's demands, but the big mill-owners, headed by the company, set their faces against the demands and refused even to grant a conference to the men. Not only were the men's proposals eminently fair, but they tried by every means in their power to find a peaceful solution of the difficulty. As far back as the beginning of March, and even before then,, they threw out invitations to the sugar-growers to have a conference in regard to the matters in dispute. The sugar-growers scornfully refused to have a conference, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company pooh-poohed the whole proposal, and said that it had no dispute with its employes at all, and would not hear of anything. The consequence was that the men were forced to enter upon an organized strike in order to obtain a minimum of the concessions which they had asked for. Now I do not want to be misunderstood. I do not wish to pose here as an advocate of strikes, or anything of the kind. I have been in a few strikes. I have always been a member of an organized industrial union, and I dislike strikes as much as anybody does, because they bring untold suffering upon persons who very often have no particular connexion with the industrial trouble in hand, as well as upon those engaged in the industry. But there are times when it becomes necessary for men to go on strike in order to obtain a minimum of justice, and the late sugar strike was undoubtedly one of that kind. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, as I have said, set its face sternly against a conference or against anything which would tend to bring about a peaceful solution of the difficulty, and the consequence was that we were threatened in Australia with, not only the sugar industry being hung up, but our great shipping industry, and, perhaps, several other industries being hung up, if the dispute were prolonged much further. It is a very serious thing, indeed, when one large corporation is given so much power that it is able to provoke a contest of that kind. A suggestion was put forward at that time by the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes, that perhaps an effective way to bring the company to its senses would be to remove the protective duty, and compensate the sugar growers in some other way. That might be a very effective way of dealing with the company, and I have not the slightest doubt that it would -bring the company to its senses, and completely protect the public from its depredations. If that had been done, the company would not have been able to charge the people of Australia £b or £1 a ton more for their sugar than they charged the people of New Zealand, where there is no protective duty. But I refuse to believe that that suggestion was put forward in any serious spirit at all, because I hold that the removal of the duty is not the remedy for the troubles existing in the sugar industry.

It must be remembered that, if you got even with the company by removing the duty, you would also stand a splendid chance of killing the sugar industry, and depriving men of any work at all, or the sugar-growers of any profitable source of employment. You might kill the whole thing, and there is no industry in Australia, whether protected or not, which is so valuable to the people as is the sugar industry, because it has settled in a portion of our coast, which otherwise would be practically unoccupied, a large, prosperous, and thriving population. The sugar duty is the only protective duty that I know of which has succeeded in settling a very large number of persons actually on the land, and which has given us a fixed population in a part of the coast which, perhaps, would otherwise be very sparsely occupied, and that settled portion, with a large number of workers employed on it, is the most effective occupation we can have, and the best means of defence against a foreign foe, if it should ever come against us, because, unless we have our land settled and occupied, our hope of effective defence will be very small indeed.

If the abolition of a duty is the remedy to be applied to one part of Australia, then, undoubtedly, it must be applied to every other part. I am not one of those who believe that, because the referenda went against us, therefore we should cease to give effective Protection to Australian industries. While it is true that the employers sternly refuse, as they have always done, to give anything but the bare minimum wage to their workers, while they insist on grasping, for their own advantage, almost the whole of the benefit of the Tariff, I hold that the refusal to give Protection is not the way to build up Australia, or the way to do good for the workers. The way to do good for the workers is to build up industries by a protective Tariff, and to find another way of dealing with the recalcitrant employers who will not give a fair deal to their workers.

I regret exceedingly - although some people seem to think it a matter for congratulation - that our revenue from Customs and Excise is mounting up by leaps and bounds. I regret that conditions in Australia are such that the revenue derived from importations is advancing by several millions. When we passed our last Tariff I hoped that it would bring us an increased revenue for a year or two, but I thought that after it had had the effect of establishing industries the revenue from Customs duties would considerably decline. I believed that it would do so in proportion as the people of Australia began to feel their feet in manufacturing industries and to supply their own wants to a larger extent. That is the natural effect of an effective protective Tariff. If the present Tariff is not effectively protective it ought to be made so. If it be wise to refuse to grant more Protection to Australian industries, because certain manufacturers will not give a fair deal to their workers, I say that those who take up that position should immediately advocate the removal of existing protective duties. If it is contended that the manufacturers are getting an undue advantage, and are not sharing it with their workers, the logical thing would be to wipe out the existing protection.

Therefore, I say, that those people who would refuse full Protection because some manufacturers sweat their workmen and do not give them a fair deal, ought, if they are to be logical, to refuse to grant the present Protection until such time as the employers come to their senses and grant better conditions to their employes. I, however, want to see all Australian industries placed under aneffective protective Tariff, whilst, at the same time, assuring to the workers a fair deal by other means. It was not the employers of Australia who beat us at the last referenda, and refused to give us the power that we wanted to secure to the workers a fair deal. It was the working people of Australia who beat us, simply because they were labouring under a misconception. Nine-tenths of the voters of Australia, from one end of this country to the other, are working people. Therefore, it must have been working people who beat us on the 26th April. If they had known in what direction their true interests lay, and had not been so grossly deceived by the campaign of misrepresentation indulged in by the press, and by honorable senators opposite, they certainly would have answered ' Yes ' to the referenda questions. I am satisfied that when the people of this country have been taught by bitter experience what the monopoly of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company means, they will give us such effective powers as will enable us to secure justice for them.

Of the quantity produced by coloured labour it is safe to say that about nine-tenths was produced under the auspices of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. In North Queensland, wherever they possibly can, they lease lands to Chinese growers. The sugar is grown by Chinese labour under Chinese conditions,, and the cane is crushed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. They go so far that, on the Herbert river, where they lease a tramway from the local authorities from Lucinda Point to Ingham, they even do the fettling by coloured labour. Of course, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is open to the usual criticism applying to companies, that it has neither a body to be kicked nor a soul to be damned. All its desire is to grind dividends out of the people of Australia for the benefit of its shareholders, and it employs every means at its command to accomplish that object. It employs coloured labour wherever there is a chance by leasing land to Chinese, and it takes the cane of the Chinese, grown under Asiatic conditions. Why should this Commonwealth of Australia encourage the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to do that sort of thing by giving to the sugar grown by coloured labour a protection of no less than £2 a ton? It is not fair to refuse protection to the white employer because he will not give fair conditions to his employes, when we are giving protection to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company which employs Chinese. I entered the Senate as an advocate of the abolition of all Protection to sugar that is produced by coloured labour. I did my best to secure that result, but only succeeded in getting the measure of Protection that was accorded to sugar grown by black labour decreased by £1 per ton, .and the bounty that was paid to sugar grown by white labour increased by a similar amount. In order to show the position which I assumed when I contested an election for a seat in this Parliament seven years ago, I propose to quote from the first speech which I delivered at Cairns, the town in which I lived, and which is one of the important sugar-growing centres of Queensland.

The grower of sugar by coloured labour receives no bonus whatever, but gets an effective protection of £2 per ton. I say that that protection should be removed by this Parliament immediately. Nearly the whole of the sugar that is produced by coloured labour is grown under the auspices of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, because the Chinaman is a more subservient individual than the white worker - or, as Senator St. Leger would describe him, 'a more peace-loving, employe' - his standard of living is lower than that of the white man, and consequently he receives a preference from it.

But, unfortunately, it has not the power to do so. I am aware that that very powerful journal, the Age , has recently published a series of articles in which it advocated the establishment of a sugar refinery by the Commonwealth. I can hardly persuade myself that the Age is serious in this matter. The writers of the Age are too well informed not to be aware that the Common wealth has not the power, under the Constitution as it stands, to engage in commercial enterprises of that kind. The Age was one of the most potent factors in Victoria in preventing us from getting the necessary power to do so. It, of course, assumes a high attitude, and says, ' There are our arguments, and there is no disputing them.' But if those arguments were presented to the High Court of Australia, which is the deciding tribunal, they would cause only a smile of derisive contempt at such puerilities being put forward as serious propositions. Of course, the writers of the Age strive to cloud the issue by a statement of fact that we could start a sugar refinery on the lines of the military clothing and harness factories; or we could start a sugar refinery in the Federal Territory, or the Northern Territory, which are under the sole jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament. All these statements are quite true, but they do not apply in this case, because they provide no remedy. We could establish a sugar refinery to supply our own employes with refined sugar as part of their daily wage, or as rations supplied to them under contract, but that would not solve the question of the price of sugar to the public, nor would it affect the monopoly of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It is also true that we might start a refinery to produce unlimited refined sugar in the Federal Territory, or in the Northern Territory, but what would be the use of that when we dare not sell it outside the bounds of the territory under Federal control. With the small population of the Northern Territory, or of the Federal Territory, all the refined sugar we could find a market for would not be worth taking into account, and directly we embarked upon the commercial enterprise of distributing the sugar outside the boundaries of Federal territory we should go beyond the limits imposed upon our action by the Constitution as Tt stands. The writers of the Age are usually well informed, and I have no doubt that they are as well aware of these facts as I am, but they desire now to climb down after the abnormal attitude they took up at the time of the referenda.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","236","GIVENS, Thomas","KLS","N/A","N/A","N/A","345","I am not now dealing with that aspect of the question. If, as I say, we could not engage in such an enterprise, the question whether we could do so profitably or not does not arise. There is another way in which this matter could be dealt with. When the sugar strike was at its height, the Minister of Trade and Customs visited Bundaberg, and most commendably attempted to put an end to it. He went up with the avowed purpose, which he tried his utmost to carry out, of effecting conciliation between the contending parties. The question arose whether the industry could afford the increased wages asked for. Some of the growers took up -this position : They said, ' You are retaining £i per ton out of the protective duty as a contribution from this industry to the revenue of the country. If you would forego that we should be able to give the men the improved conditions and better wages they are asking for.' It is quite true, as the growers pointed out, that the Commonwealth is deriving a revenue of over £200,000 a year from the sugar industry in the shape of £1 per ton Excise duty, representing the difference between the amount of Excise collected on white-grown sugar and the amount of bounty paid. And, in addition to that, the Commonwealth receives £4 per ton Excise on over 16,000 ton s of sugar produced by coloured labour; the total amounting to .£230,000 or £240,000 per annum. That is a handsome contribution to the revenue, but the Minister of Trade and Customs suggested, in order to bring about good conditions in the industry, that the Government might be willing to give up that £230,000 or £240,000, and give the growers the benefit of the full £6 per ton protection. Still he could arrive at no settlement, and he had to come back to Melbourne disappointed at having been unable to effect his object. I think that., allowing that £1 Excise to the growers would not solve the difficulty, or place them in a better position than they are in at the present time to pay fair wages to their employes. In my opinion, the position would not be altered by the adoption of that course, because, no matter what Protection this Parliament gives the sugar industry, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company collars the lion's share. I pointed out a little time ago that of two mills established side by side, one a Colonial Sugar Refining Company's mill, and the other a co-operative mill, the latter can afford to pay from 4s. to 6s. pel ton more for cane than is paid by the former. I can go further, and say now that the co-operative mills could pay at least 10s. per ton more than the Colonial  Sugar Refining Company's mills are at present paying for cane if they could get a fair price from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for their raw sugar. It therefore appears to me that every concession may fatten the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and do little good to the growers and workers in the industry. But if we were to establish a rival refinery of some sort, a national refinery under the Commonwealth, a State refinery under a State Government, or a co-operative refinery worked by the growers, we would effect a great saving, which would benefit every citizen in Australia, as well as the people immediately engaged in the sugar industry. At present, at the sweet will of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,- the people of Australia are paying from £d. to fd. more per pound for sugar than they need pay; the growers have to accept less for their cane than they ought to be asked to accept, and, in their turn, pay less wages and provide worse conditions for their workers than they would otherwise be able to do. As, apparently, we are powerless to establish a national refinery, and as the State Governments will not undertake the duty of establishing a State refinery, the only alternative left - and the one which I admit is the least desirable - is the establishment of a cooperative refinery, I put forward the suggestion, for the consideration of the Commonwealth Government, in the interests of the people of Australia, as a whole, and of the sugar industry, that a large portion of the revenue now derived from sugar might be devoted to the establishment of a co-operative refinery on somewhat similar lines as those on which the Queensland Parliament voted £500,000 for the establishment of central mills to crush the cane and produce the raw sugar. It would nor be too much to apply to the purpose if the object in view were anything like accomplished. The people of Australia pay far more than £250,000 a year in an undue price for sugar. If we could, without great cost, by a loan or a subsidy, secure the establishment of a rival co-operative sugar refinery to supply the people of Australia, with sugar at a reasonable price, we could bring the directors and shareholders of the Colonial Sugar Refinery Company to their senses, effect a large saving to the people of Australia, and accomplish a great deal of good in connexion with a very valuable industry. I shall not go into details in connexion with the subject on this occasion. This is not the time for such details, but if the Royal Commission suggested is appointed, I shall be prepared to supply it with details, and to do my best to assist any one who thinks the scheme worth carrying out. In any event, some effective means will have to be found to deal with this question before the people of Australia come to find the position unbearable. I have to congratulate Parliament, the Government, and the country upon the fact that, after strong efforts on both sides, the great sugar strike which threatened to be so disastrous at one time has been satisfactorily settled. That is something to go on with, but while the conditions in the industry remain as at present, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company continue to possess a monopoly, we can never be sure that the conditions of unrest will not again be revived, and trouble ensue. I believe that one of the most effective means of obviating anything of the kind would be to break the power of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is dominating the whole position. It is not good for any industry that its condition should be dominated by a monopoly, and it is especially evil in the case of the sugar industry, which supplies an article of necessary daily use for every man and woman in Australia. While I admit that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company supplies a first rate article, I contend that in every other aspect of the case, the company entirely fails in its duty to supply this necessary commodity to the people at as cheap a rate as possible, consistent with the prosperity of the industry. I hope the Government will consider the suggestion I have made, and that if the Commission that has been so long talked of is appointed, it will give it the power to inquire into that, and cognate matters, so that every phase of the question may be covered. As I said in the beginning, I did not intend to cover any political ground at all, but to refer only to two or three matters of particular interest to myself and the people I represent. Having accomplished that, I have done all I desired, and I thank the Senate for the very patient way in which what I have said has been listened to.

I confess that I do not thoroughly understand the sugar question, and am very glad to obtain information to assist me to a clear understanding of the matter. It is lamentable that, although we have given between £2,000,000 and ,£3,000,000 to those engaged in the sugar industry, the conditions in that industry should be as they have been described. I agree with Senator Givens that a wage of 30s. per week for men working eight hours per day in such a climate is top little for white workers. At the same time, it should not be forgotten that something might have been done to remedy such a state of affairs. Nearly two years ago, a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate conditions in the industry, and it was only the illness of a Judge which prevented that Commission getting to work. When a change of Government took place, nothing was done to set the Commission to work to make the necessary inquiries, which might have avoided all the trouble that has since taken place in the industry. Apparently, the authorities were content to allow matters to drift until we reached the state of affairs which led to the recent strike. We were told a little time ago in the press by the Acting Prime Minister that a remedy would be found, and we thought that a remedy was going to be found, and right away; but nothing has been done, and now the Government are falling back upon what the last Government proposed nearly two years ago, namely, a Commission, which could have reported within the period of six months, and which might have avoided all this trouble.

Why not find out if the Government have the power to establish a refinery? I may be wrong, but I fancy, speaking from memory, that Senator Pearce, when he brought in his proposals in 1903, argued that under the trade and commerce power of section 51 of the Constitution the Commonwealth could take any industry and nationalize it and go into business. If he was right at that time, the same thing must be right now.  Senator Givens. 'Oh, no; the High Court has had a very important say on the question since then. I am inclined to think that the Age, which does not speak at random, which is a most careful newspaper, and which has the best legal talent at its command whenever it advocates a proposal, would not have made this statement so clearly and so confidently as it has done unless it had ample ground for believing that the Commonwealth had power to establish a national refinery. However, let us hope that something will be done in order that this trouble may not be repeated. We have spent enormous sums of public money to secure the establishment of the sugar industry by white labour, and it is a pity that we have spent all that money if our people are to pay £6 or £7 a. ton more for the sugar than is charged in other countries, and there is to be such great dissatisfaction in the cane-fields. Senator Givens touched upon another point, and I think that he was scarcely fair. 'He said that, at the referendum, the people refused to give to the Government power to deal with monopolies, and he argued as if that was the only question which was put to the country at that time. But he knows very well that that was not the case; he is well aware that every speaker on a platform who was against the referenda at that time said that he was willing, and that the people should be asked, to give the power to deal with trusts and monopolies. But there were other important matters included in the referenda. There was a radical change proposed, which, if ratified', would have dwarfed the States, and made them complete nonentities.

Senator Givens lias stated that at the referendum the workers were misled. Surely the workers of Australia have sufficient common sense to understand proposals when submitted. Is not the honorable senator uttering the strongest condemnation of the proposals themselves and the attitude which the Government and the Labour party took up in regard to them when he says that the workers, who compose nine-tenths of this population, would not have them? What stronger condemnation than that could he utter? Does he think that the workers would turn against those whom they consider their friends, and defeat such proposals by a quarter of a million votes unless they thought they were unworthy of acceptance? The suggestion will not stand argument. At the last election we had senators returned by a majority of a few thousand votes - one candidate was beaten by only 1,100 votes. In a similar constituency - the whole of the people - we have proposals turned down by a majority of a quarter of a million votes. What a volte-face is that! It is nonsense for Senator Givens to say that the people of Australia would not empower this Parliament to deal with trusts and monopolies. Every speaker from a platform would have consented to grant such power, and the people would willingly have clone so. As Senator St. Ledger said, an offer was made by the Leader of the Opposition in another place to agree to the referendum if it were confined to the question of taking power to deal with trusts and monopolies.

They quite understand the right or the wrong of a proposal, and they were not prepared to accept the proposals of the Government, simply because they did not believe that they were wise and would be beneficial to Australia. It is of no use for any one to say that the people refused to grant to this Parliament power to deal with trusts and monopolies. If they had been asked for such a power, it would have been willingly conferred, but the Labour party, elated by their success at the general elections, and believing that the wave which swept them into power had not subsided, put forward these audacious proposals, and they met with a fitting fate. What do we find now? Do we find any intimation in the Speech that the proposals are to be made again? No. The only announcement which is made is that power is to be asked from the people to deal with trusts and monopolies, because the Government know well that such power will be given, but the other powers asked for in April will not be given. With much of Senator Givens' speech I am in thorough agreement. I sympathize with the men employed in the sugar industry. I think that they asked very little, but the honorable senator was wrong in condemning the proposal of the Age without our having the clearest legal opinion on the point. I read the articles very carefully, and it seemed to me that the writer had the best of the argument, and that the section dealing with trade and commerce does give that power. At any rate, it is worth a trial. As this Parliament meets year after year, one perceives the utter uselessness of a debate on the Address-in-Reply. Really, 1 think it is time that the Government took this matter in hand. Of course, we must have an Address, because it is .the King's representative who calls Parliament together.

No. In the old days, a debate on the Address-in-Reply to the opening Speech might have been desirable to educate the people, but now we have a press which gives them all the information they require. The debate settles nothing, and very often it only embitters the relations between the two sides. If a debate of this kind were necessary at one time, surely it is less necessary than ever now when all the business of Parliament is threshed out by the dominant party beforehand, and questions settled so that the' programme cannot be altered. We are here to-day as a registration body, and not as a representative or legislative body. We cannot alter the course of legislation once it has been settled. Why, therefore, should we waste two or three weeks of the country's valuable time, especially after a recess of nine or ten months, in beating the air as we are doing? The Speech itself is very mild indeed. There is nothing very truculent about the Speech, and evidently the Government's desire is to have a very quiet and peaceful session. 1 have heard that the depressing influence of the vote at the referendum is having its effect upon the party.

The British Government wanted the naval subsidy to be nearly doubled. They succeeded in getting a promise that Australia would pay £200,000 a year and New Zealand £40,000, for naval defence. When that proposal was submitted here it was opposed by the Labour party, who have always been opposed to the British Fleet and the British Army. They have never had a good word to say for the British soldier and sailor. The establishment of an Australian Fleet has for years been in Mr. D eakin 's mind, though he had to accept the proposals made by Sir Edmund Barton and Sir John Forrest. If Parliament had rejected those proposals, we should have been loafing on the British Government and paying nothing for our naval protection. From that time forth, however, Mr. D eakin used all his efforts to get the Naval Agreement with the Admiralty cancelled. In 1907 he submitted definite proposals for the cancellation of the Agreement, and it was cancelled. To say, therefore, that the new scheme of defence is due to the Labour party is simply equivalent to going about in filched plumage. If honorable senators opposite will read the magnificent speech by Mr. D eakin, in which he laid down the whole platform and policy of naval and military defence in another place, they will realize how unjust their claims are. On that occasion Mr. Fisher said that the speech was the finest utterance Mr. D eakin had ever made, and that he cordially agreed with the policy there laid down. But Mr. D eakin did more than that. He placed £250,000 to a Trust Fund for naval defence purposes, though a promise was given that the money would not be touched until Parliament determined exactly how it should be spent.

If honorable senators opposite say, therefore, that this Government is the author of the present policy of naval and military defence, they are claiming credit that is not due to them. I hope that the question will be definitely looked into by some impartial authority, and that the history of it will be given, in order that credit and blame may be attributed to the right people. I would especially ask honorable senators opposite to read that magnificent speech made by Mr. Deakin in 1907. With regard to the building of war-ships, I should like to know why a contract was given to the New South Wales Government to build for cost, with 10 per cent, added, without affording Victorian firms an opportunity to tender? 1 feel sure that other firms would have been glad to undertake the work on those terms. I also desire to touch on the question of universal training. I believe that the night drills for boys are doing a great deal of harm.

I would rather pay the penalty, and, if I could not get out of it in any other way, I would send him out of the country. I cannot think that it is right to require lads to go out to drill at night, with all sorts of fellows, listening to all sorts of language, under officers who have no real control over them. Some cases have been reported of larrikinism by some of the youths, but the Acting Minister of Defence merely sneered and took no further notice of them. Then there is the matter of drill halls. These lads should be drilled in proper halls, which should be obtained by the Government. Ministers say that they have attempted to obtain the use of halls all over the country, and have failed. But they refuse to grant the use of their own drill halls for any purpose. Only last week, application was made by a physical culture class in Kerang for the use of a drill hall in that neighbourhood for an hour or two a week. They were refused.

In Canada, some of the finest halls in the country are what are called ' Armouries,' which are used for training purposes. Forces who have the use of places like those become, proud of their institutions and buildings, and are pleased to be trained in them. To drill young lads in the open air at night is not a right thing at all. If the ,£30,000 in excess of the amount authorized by Parliament, which has been spent upon the Federal Capital, had been devoted to the erection of drill halls in various parts of Australia, there would not have been so much ground for complaint. Parliament authorized the expenditure of £54,000 on the Federal Capital, but ,£84,000 has been spent. That was not a proper thing to do, and many of those who now support the Government would have complained if it had been done by any other Ministry. It also looks as if we were not going to get the best design obtainable for the Capital City. Competition is to be limited to a very small circle. When Washington was laid out, designs were invited from the whole world, and, as a matter of fact, a Frenchman was chosen ultimately to lay out the city. Every one who has been there knows that Washington is one of the best designed cities in the world. An endeavour should have been made to meet the views of English architects, in order that the widest possible range of competition might have been secured. One must be disappointed at knowing that nothing definite is contemplated in regard to the Tariff. We are told in the Governor-General's Speech that the operation of the existing Tariff is ' being carefully watched,' but watching seems to be all that is to be done. I do not agree with the argument that before we touch the Tariff we should see to it that the workers get full benefit from it. Senator Givens was quite right in the argument he addressed to the Senate this afternoon. He said that' if we are going to pursue the policy of securing full benefits to the workers before we institute a thoroughly scientific Protective Tariff, we shall, in the end, probably have a great Tariff but nobody working under it. I have always contended that we should secure work for our workmen first, and insure proper conditions of labour afterwards. But if we are going to deprive Australia of an effective Tariff until the labour conditions are satisfactorily arranged, we might as well wipe out Protection altogether. The truth seems to me to be that the Government are not sure of carrying Protection within their own party. We know that originally that party was just about equally divided on the Tariff issue.

At the Collingwood hat factory, from £^200,000 worth to .£300,000 worth of hats were manufactured last year, and £^200,000 worth were imported. Why were they imported? Because the factory could not get the labour which it required. The Hatters' Union kept five hatters, who possessed certificates of competency and the clearances from their unions, out of work for three months after their arrival here, because it would not admit them into its ranks, unless they agreed to pay £40 each. This want of labour is what is going to kill Protection. Labour is wanted in almost every branch of industry in this country. Only a little while ago, I entered a furniture warehouse for the purpose of purchasing two or three small articles.

What lines the amendment will follow I do not know. I was very disappointed when I heard an honorable senator deprecating the idea of industrial peace. We know that early in the present year strikes appeared to be stirred up in all directions. Some gentlemen who ought to have been advocates of industrial peace were striving to create dissension everywhere. If we desire the good of Australia, we ought to do our utmost to insure industrial peace. Year after year we have been amending our Conciliation and Arbitration Act and introducing Wages Boards, with a view to bettering the position of the worker. But all our efforts have been in vain. Take the case of the Newcastle strike, which occurred in 1909. That was a monstrous strike, and it was started by the leader of the Labour party, the late Acting Prime Minister. He moved the resolution which brought it about. Then when the Coercion Act became law in New South Wales, and prominent members of the party became afraid of being gaoled, they sneaked out of the trouble, and allowed Peter Bowling to bear the brunt of it. I am glad to note that the development of the Northern Territory is to be taken in hand. I look upon the settlement of that Territory as the most serious problem which we have to face. I opposed the transfer of it to the Commonwealth, because I did hot believe in the conditions surrounding the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek.

Hitherto all the great systems of agriculture have been formulated and carried on under moist conditions; but a system of dry land agriculture has not yet been formulated, though' they are doing it in America now. It is a most serious problem - the problem of whether white men, and especially white women, will be able to make a living there. I do hope that the Government will have the whole question investigated, so that we may get the very best results from the land which is to be settled.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","322","MCCOLL, James","KQ4","N/A","N/A","N/A","354","No; I am . aware that there is a good deal of dry farming carried on in Australia. What I am saying is that the question of how the Northern Territory is to be administered and settled is one of the most important which the Government have to consider. If they desire people to go there, take up land, and work it as farms, they must establish experimental farms in advance of settlement in order that the settlers may be informed as to what they ought to do, otherwise we shall have failure after failure. The Northern Territory is the danger zone of Australia. There are only 1,200 white people there, and it is not more than five or six days steam distant from Japan and China. I lately had the pleasure of listening to a gentleman who came from China and Japan two or three months ago. He made the statement that the changes taking place in China at the present time are enormous.- The Chinese are doing away with their old educational institutions, and are now running their schools on European lines. The latest implements of warfare are to be found there, and a Chinese Parliament will meet in 1913. The most important social, industrial, military and religious changes are taking place there, and very shortly the country, instead of being governed by the  Emperor, his Council, and Viceroys, will be governed by representatives elected by the people themselves. They are now building their Parliament Houses, and in 1913 a Chinese Parliament will meet. We have to bear in mind that China, with her 435,000,000 of people, is to-day a very different China from what she was a few years ago. The Chinese are a peaceful nation, but when people begin to realize their strength, they are sometimes disinclined to continue to be peaceful. A few years ago, the Chinese were asked by the British Government to refrain from dealing in opium; a term of ten years was arranged for the cessation of the traffic in opium, and -to-day there are whole provinces in China in which a poppy plant is not to be seen. In a few years now the traffic will be at an end. The whole condition of China is altered, and we must have the Northern Territory settled, or we may have to deal with a people who, by sheer weight of numbers, might overbear not only Japan, but this country as easily as possible. I am very glad to see that the Government are proposing reciprocal - trade relations with Canada and New Zealand. It will be of great advantage to this country if we establish trade relations with Canada. We have to depend on our primary products from the soil for our prosperity, and we must increase the markets for those engaged in our primary industries. There is no market that seems to me more tempting than the Canadian market. There will be soon running into Vancouver four great lines of railway; the seasons in Canada dovetail into ours, and if we could get our fruit carried there, -we should for three or four months of the year command the Canadian market. If we wish our people to be settled on the land, it is our duty to find markets for. their produce, and we should require a direct line of steamers from each port. There are enormous opportunities for trade in Canada; there are 7,500,000 people there, whilst we have only 4,500,000. Canada has only 7,250,000 -cattle, whilst we have 11,250,000, and Canada has only 3,000,000 sheep, whilst we have no less than 92,000,000. There is room for a great trade with that country, in frozen meat, dairy products, and fruit. I. hope, therefore, that the Government promise to establish reciprocal trade with Canada will be given effect. -We must have direct lines of steamers from each of our large ports. Hitherto, exports to Canada have had to be transhipped al; Sydney, and this has involved a great deal of unnecessary expense. It is a drawback and a danger to Australia that boats running between this country and Canada should call at New Zealand. In one case, I know that sixteen Americans who were coming over with the object of settling in Australia were intercepted in New Zealand, and they remained there. I know also that some undergraduates from Pueblo, Colorado, coming to -this country stopped at New Zealand, and were persuaded to remain there.

I am speaking of Canada as a market for our produce. I am showing how the country is being opened up, and that there is there a great scarcity in the local production of fruit, butter, and mutton.- Mutton is almost unknown in Canada, because of the very small number of sheep there. I hope the Government will keep these matters in view. I am aware that an order was received some time ago in Victoria from Canada for 50,000 cases of apples, but, because of lack of space on the boats, they could not be supplied. I may inform honorable senators that Washington imports peaches under cold storage from South Africa, and their fruits bring high prices in Washington and in London. Our seasons dovetail into the Canadian seasons, and we ought to make a. big effort to get into- the Canadian market. The land tax is referred to in the Governor-General's Speech as having cheapened land and induced settlement. ' It has not cheapened land, nor do I think it will do so, but I believe that it will have some effect in the breaking up of large estates, and so will induce settlement later on. It is, however, too early yet to take credit for the land tax for any increased settlement. A reference is made to the trip to Papua.  Personally, I think it was a useless waste of money. The members of this Parliament who took part in it no doubt had a very good trip, but they could not have obtained much information, and their visit will, I think, be of very little use to the country. A reference is also made to penny postage, and it is claimed that if the Federal Government err in anything it is not in administration, I do not think the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department was ever worse than it is at the present time. The whole service is rife with complaints. I wish particularly to call attention to the way in which country services and post-offices are being treated. When the revenue from country services does not equal the cost of running them, the Government are making the people pay the difference, unless it amounts to less than £5. The Department threatened to discontinue a service in one of the northern districts of Victoria because the revenue derived from it was £6 7s. id. short of what was expended. I came down specially to Melbourne to try to induce the Department to alter its determination. If the difference had been £4 19s. 6d., the people would not have been charged anything, but as it amounted to £6 7s. id. they were asked to pay up that amount, or the service would be discontinued.

I wrote to the Department, and offered to guarantee the amount required, but the authorities would not accept my guarantee, and, in order to keep the service going I gave my cheque, and hold a receipt for the amount now in my possession. -I think this is cutting matters a little too fine. It seems to me that where there is a large population, and a big voting strength, the people get every consideration, whilst scattered settlements in our back districts receive no consideration at all. I intend to test the feeling of the Senate as to whether this sort of thing should be continued. In pre- Federal days there was nothing of this sort. Districts were not charged with any shortage in the revenue from public services. In many cases post-offices were kept open where the cost amounted to a shilling apiece for the delivery of letters. We are continually preaching to the people that they should go upon the land, and yet the Government are depriving them of the ordinary advantages of citizenship, unless they pay personally for the cost of the services they enjoy. In many cases the payments to persons in charge of allowance post-offices have been cut down. I have a letter from another part of the northern district of Victoria, from a man who is being paid £5 a year for keeping a post-office. He has been given notice that from the 1st July last his remuneration will only be at the rate of £3 a year. It is not a very big post-office certainly, but the man is required to be always in attendance. The postage is stated to be 708 letters and 276 packets, and he receives 2,484 letters and 1,500 packets. He is allowed the privilege of selling stamps, provided he pays cash for the stamps beforehand, and he is then given a commission of 6d. in the £1 on their sale.

I intend to submit a motion to the Senate dealing with country mail services, and the payments made to country postmasters. Another step taken by the Department which I look upon as distinctly retrograde is the closing of post and telegraph offices at 6 p.m. This has been, on many occasions, a serious inconvenience to me, and it must be of very great inconvenience to the public at large throughout Australia. I notice that a large deputation waited upon the Minister yesterday in connexion' with this matter, but they got rather cold comfort from him. He is disposed apparently to look at it from the pounds, shillings, and pence point of view only. He has said that only so many telegrams are received after 6 p.m., and the offices cannot therefore be kept open.

If good government cannot insure prosperity to a country, it is, at all events, true that bad government can drive prosperity out; and the worst records to be found in the history of this State are those of the period when the honorable senator was a member of a Ministry. There has been no time in Victoria's history when so many men had to walk the streets as was the case then. In face of what then occurred, the honorable senator now poses as an authority on banking and of the risks which a Commonwealth bank would entail. The honorable senator is well aware, as a Victorian Minister at the time to which I am referring, that his Government did things of which he is ashamed to-day. People were not permitted to receive the deposits which they had put in the banks because of the action of his Government. . He ought to remember his association with some of those institutions when he speaks of what a Commonwealth bank might possibly do. The honorable senator said that the Government of the time could have saved every one of the banks. If the State could have saved those rotten institutions, which crumbled one after the other, surely the Commonwealth is six times as powerful as any individual State, and could guarantee the stability of an institution established by itself.

Senator McColl must have been a very busy man during the recess. He was not able to visit Papua with the parliamentary party of inspection, and consequently he denounces the trip as a pure waste of money. I will let the honorable senator into a secret. Almost at the last moment, I found that it would be very inconvenient for me to accompany the party, and, consequently, I decided to abandon the visit.

As I did not wish to be bracketed with them, I resolved, at considerable personal inconvenience, to make the trip.

As the result of that visit, I believe that a certain number of members in this Parliament are in possession of information upon many matters which will prove of great value to the Commonwealth. Surely, it will not be urged that it is possible to get as accurate information concerning a country by any other means as it is by obtaining a first-hand acquaintance with the conditions which prevail there. Is it a waste of time for legislators who are charged with the responsibility of administering the affairs of Papua to personally ascertain the position of its native inhabitants, so that we may be able to prevent them being exploited by the white man? I believe that the trip will prove of great benefit to the Commonwealth. We found that the natives of Papua are capable of being educated up to a very high standard. I have school books in my possession which prove that native children up to twelve and thirteen years of age are quite as capable of assimilating knowledge as are children of similar age attending our own State schools. I confess that previously I had entertained the idea that the natives fell far short of the standard of excellence which I found amongst them. It may interest Senator McColl to learn that in a New Guinea plantation we saw the natives of that country handling a plough almost as well as a white man could handle it. We learnt that they were engaged in various forms of agriculture, and that they do not depend upon the white man for food, but produce all their own foodstuffs. Seeing that the honorable senator admires thrift so much, let me inform him that indifferent parts of the island we saw storehouses in which were stored from 200 -to 400 tons of potatoes for future consumption.

I have never heard of any complaint by a native of Papua - either man, woman, or child - that he or she lacked the necessaries of life. Consequently, we have to ask ourselves the question, ' Why do these people work for the white man?' They do so simply because they desire to obtain tobacco and a few luxuries. But wherever they are so employed, their health suffers, and they receive less of the food to which they are accustomed than they would otherwise do. So far as housing and living are concerned, the great majority occupy a position of comparative comfort. They do not require to work in large numbers for the white man. But the latter is particularly anxious to secure native labour by taxing them, notwithstanding, that the natives, as the result of the tobacco which they smoke, already contribute 70 per cent, of the revenue of the country. Consequently, the white planter can have only one object in compelling them to work for him, namely, a desire to exploit them. These are serious problems which must demand our earnest attention, in the near future. T admit that, so far I have not matured ideas upon them. But I feel sure that if a proposal to compel the natives to work for the white planters were submitted to this Parliament Senator McColl, had he visited Papua, would have been better able to cast -a wise vote upon it than he is at present. But simply because the newspapers of this State opposed the trip, he lacked the courage to make it, and to learn first-hand the con,ditions which obtain there.

I agree that this debate is a waste of time, and all my sympathies are with the President in having to sit and listen to it. A few remarks have fallen from honorable senators opposite during the debate which, I think, require an answer. I shall not make an outcry, as some have done, about the result of the referenda. I feel as Senator Gould felt last year, when he admitted that his party had been weighed in the balance, and found wanting. At the referenda we were weighed in the balance, and found very much wanting; but I am prepared to accept the verdict of the people on that occasion without offering any excuses for it. Senator Millen said that I had been making excuses for it; but, as a matter of fact, I made none. Certain honorable senators opposite have referred to the manner in which some of the members of our party were nobbled on that occasion. They told us how poor Mr. Holman, Mr. Beeby, and Mr. McGowen were hobbled, shackled, and bound by a Labour Conference. I wish to say that if they were shackled and bound, it was only with a silken thread, which they might have burst at will. I, personally, should have been much better pleased if they had done so, and had openly and boldly proclaimed their opposition to the referenda proposals. Their silence was made good use of by the other side, from every Conservative platform in Australia, and through every journal opposed to the Labour party. I wish to say that they were not the only persons silenced, but we did not hear one word about the silencing of one of the brightest intellects in the New South Wales Parliament, who, though on the other side generally in politics, made a manly and straightforward speech in that Parliament in support of the referenda proposals. When I asked across the chamber how the party opposite nobbled Mr. David Fell, the honorable senator who was speaking, said, 'Who is David Fell? I never heard of him.' I say now that he is one of the brightest intellects in the New South Wales Parliament, and because he made a speech in favour of the referenda proposals, he was nobbled in some way. We have not been told how, and, in fact, nothing has been said on the subject, but we know that pressure was brought to bear upon that man in connexion with his business interests, and he was in that way compelled to keep silence. One of the strongest speeches made in favour of the proposals of the Labour party was made by him, and as some honorable senators opposite have not heard of that gentleman, or his speech, I shall read a little of it to show what sort of a speech it was. Mr. David Fell said-  ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","475","MCDOUGALL, Allan","KTD","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Reference .has been made to the Federal referenda, and the Leader of the Opposition called upon members of the Government to declare themselves on that point. I do not know whether he wished any other honorable member to declare himself. But I should like to state here, without fear or favour, that I am prepared to declare myself. It is not the first time I have declared myself on the question nf the Federation as against the State. I believe that I am voicing the feeling of the majority of the people of Australia when I say that the Federation will be upheld before the State. If young Australians have any national sentiment, they recognise the greater potentialities of the Federation as against those of the State in which they live. If I am to be influenced by the statements of the Leader of the Opposition, who is also the leader of the party to which I belong, I must come to the conclusion that the Federal Parliament - and I am speaking of it as a Parliament in which to-day we may have a Labour Government and to-morrow some other Government - is composed, and likely to be composed, of the enemies of Australia. But I recognise that the people who sent me here also sent the representatives to the Federal Parliament, and on the principle that the greater includes the lesser, I assume that the members of the Federal Parliament, whilst they may view matters in broader perspective than we do, will also recognise the requirements of the State. I have never hesitated to tell my constituents that I am first for the Federation, secondly for the State, and thirdly for my constituency. So far as the referenda are concerned, I admit that. there is some strength in the argument of the Leader of the Opposition that it would have been much fairer to take four votes instead of one upon the questions submitted to the people. But whilst I have listened to the Leader of the Opposition, and I have read Mr. Deakin's manifesto, and Mr. Bruce Smith's letters, I have not come across any practical statement affording reasons why we should not consider some of the suggestions submitted to us by the Federal Government. I recognise that the Leader of the Opposition, viewing the matter from a legal and constitutional point of view, has it presented to him in an aspect which does not impress commercial men. But I would ask the honorable member whether it is not a fact that the conflict of opinion upon the subject of the Companies Act alone has led to tremendous expense and confusion. In New South Wales we have a Companies Act dealing with matters, which the Federal Government desire to control, which I say is a disgrace to our community. Although we have had' Government - after Government in power, not one of them has attempted to deal with that Act and put it on a proper basis. Then, again, in the matter of life insurance, for years past the public have been robbed; more or less, owing to defects in the Companies Act which are extremely irritating. Moreover, that Act does not give protection to bodies of individuals who form companies in New South Wales. At present companies formed and registered in Sydney, if they establish branches in other States, are treated as foreign companies. I would ask the public and the Leader of the Opposition whether under these circumstances he considers that the desire of the Federal Government to obtain power under the Federal Constitution to bring about conditions of uniformity in regard to company law is anything that we need feel any special concern about.

I have read sufficient to show that there was some one on the opposite side who was nobbled, not by a Conference, but by the operation of a force which would have compelled him to leave the State if he did not comply with the desires of certain people. I wish' to say a word or two about the way in which some of the members of the opposite party attempted to frighten the unthinking electors. One honorable gentleman, who is well known to us all, told the electors of South Australia that if the referenda proposals were carried, there would be a bloodier revolution in Australia than there was in France 100 years ago. In view of such statements made to unthinking people, and the terrible tales told of what the Labour party were going to do if they got the power, is it any wonder that their proposals were defeated? I shall not further enlarge upon the matter. We got our gruel, and were prepared to take it standing up. There is another matter to which I should like to refer. Senator Millen read a resolution which he said was passed by the Sydney Labour Council, and spoken to by delegates from the union to which I belong. The honorable senator tried to show that the members of that union and the Labour party generally have always been against immigration, and have turned round now only because the present Government fear the people. I was one of those who, as honorary secretary of a large union in New South Wales, circularized England, and America with the object of preventing' people being brought out to Australia under false pretences. I am not ashamed of what I .did, and should do the same thing again to-morrow if the same necessity existed. We were told that Mort's Dock Company had applied to the Minister of External Affairs for permission to bring out mechanics. I interjected ' with the approval of the unions.' I wish to say that that great company recognised the boilermakers' union. Before going to the Minister of External Affairs, they asked the union for their approval of a scheme for bringing mechanics into the State of New South Wales. They secured the approval of the union, but they did so under false pretences. They said that they were in need of a certain number of mechanics, and in this connexion I shall read some extracts which may serve to explain the situation. By the way, I have an extract here from the Sydney Daily Telegraph, which leads me to say that the authorities of that journal should, under the existing law of the State of New South Wales, be brought before the Court for attempting to provoke a strike.

Had it not been for the action of the Labour Government, who are doing their best to foster this much-needed industry of iron ship-building in Australia, there would have been a great dearth of employment in that line to-day. The Government to which Senator Millen belonged intended to have these vessels built, not in Australia, ' but in another land. The present Government have shown that they possess some stamina by declaring that they intend to give Australian workmen a chance. When, in the near future, the material has been landed, there will be plenty of work for mechanics in the trades and callings I have referred to. Can any one wonder that men embittered by hunger and the want of clothing for their offspring carry resolutions of this description? It is unfair and unjust for honorable senators on the other side to criticise the action of those who are compelled by want of employment to act in that way. We have heard during this debate, and Senator McColl has just told us, that there is room in Australia for thousands of men. So there is, but the States are not bringing in the right class. They are bringing in men for whom there are no places here. There is a class coming to Australia to-day who are being thrown on the labour market. Perhaps an extract from a Tory newspaper in Sydney will explain the position better to honorable senators opposite better than I could do.

There is rather more than a suspicion that a fair percentage of the immigrants now regularly arriving from the Motherland are simply and solely city men and youths, who have no intention of faring forth into the country to engage in primary production. Striking proof of this discomforting fact was afforded by experience of a Sydney business man last week. He was desirous of adding to his clerical staff, and advertised for a young gentleman, applications to be made in writing addressed to the office of a newspaper. The day on which notification appeared, his accountant called for and received replies numbering some scores. Next day there were many more, and, altogether, over 200 disengaged young men made known their willingness to accept the post, practically at any salary that might be fixed. ' I was astonished, and not a little grieved,' said the advertiser, in conversation, with present writer, ' to discover that the larger proportion of the applicants were immigrants - five-sixths of them, in fact. Their letters were, for the most part, well written in commercial style, indicating that their claims to be regarded as trained men were well founded. As it happened, I wanted a local man, or a man with knowledge of local conditions, and I could do nothing for any of the poor fellows.' 'You did not see any of them?' ' Yes, one, as I thought by the brevity of his note that he was a Sydney resident, and his business-like style impressed me. He told me things which I was very sorry to hear. He and many others like him had been induced to try_ their luck in this country, only to find on arrival that the opportunities of getting billets for which they are suited are few and far between. I learned as much from the letters of the applicants which I received, and it would seem that there is something radically wrong. Goodness knows, we rear more than enough clerks for our requirements, and we don't want to import more from the old land.' 'But did these immigrants not come here with the intention of entering into agricultural work?' 'Not so far as I can discover. Their letters give no hint of any such intention, and that one man I saw told me that he had been assured there were plenty of openings in Sydney, that business was booming, and so on.' ' And how are these immigrant-clerks getting on?' ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[6]/quote[4]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","475","MCDOUGALL, Allan","KTD","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","This is the part which explains the matter. From New South Wales I have received plenty of proof of the statement - ' I have heard,' said our informant, ' that a number have been taken on in various establishments at what is called a ' commencing salary,' and the old hands have been displaced. Others of the new comers have swallowed their pride, and whatever pretensions they may have had, and taken jobs as kitchen men, pantry boys, housemen, and so on. There is always a demand for this class of domestic labour, and it insures a home and food, if nothing else.'  That extract, taken from one of the Tory newspapers in Sydney, shows the state of the market so far as that class of labour is concerned. Something should be done. We, as a Labour party, say that we are pleased that men,, women and children should come to this country and engage in the primary industries, but we contend that if any Government imports men of the description I have mentioned into our towns, it can only be regarded as a menace to the Labour movement and an attempt to lower wages. I think that Senator Millen might well excuse the Labour Council for carrying the resolution, because they knew too well the consequences which flow from the introduction of such persons. We can realize that employment must be scarce in some parts of Australia when recently employers found 300, 400, and 500 men at a time in Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales to take the place of the men on strike in Queensland - men who were simply asking for a living wage, and who had worked, in ray opinion, for a starvation wage. When we find that hundreds of men in Australia are willing to ' scab ' on their fellow-men at the time of a strike, we say that employment is scarce, at all events in that line. I will admit that there is a scarcity of labour in some trades, but you cannot get skilled artisans in those trades to come here when they can get better wages in other countries. In Canada, for instance, a skilled mechanic gets 35 or 40 per cent, better wages than he could get here, notwithstanding all the boom we have, while in South Africa a skilled mechanic receives 25 per cent, more than the wages paid in Australia. You can not expect practical mechanics in the Old Country to come to Australia when they can go to other parts of the world and get from 25 to 35 per cent, better wages than are paid here. I trust that whatever may be done in the matter of advertising in the Old Country, it will be made pretty . plain that there is no room in Australia for men of that description. So long as they come to Australia we are always willing to hold out the hand of fellowship and treat them as brothers, but we say that there is no work for them here, no openings, no opportunities, and we would rather that they stayed away. The Leader of the Opposition must have had a very poor case to bring against the proposals of the Government in this Speech when he could only find small matters in connexion with our defence system to speak about, when he could only tell us, for instance, about the terrible tragedy at Mittagong, when four of our young soldiers fainted on one day. I have watched the progress of this movement in the district where I live, and there is nothing harmful to the lads in the drill. Everything depends upon the character of the area officer or the men who are put in charge of the lads. The principle of the man who is in charge of the area where I live is to appeal to the hearts of the lads, and he succeeds. After the drill is over you will see a couple of hundred lads going home with the officer, so well do they like him. A man of this description acts sensibly when youngsters begin to quarrel on parade. It has been reported that some awful offences have been committed in some districts, and that the offending lads have been hauled up to the Courts and fined. But the officer I refer to is not a man of that type. He simply takes the lads round the corner and lets them finish the quarrel. When an officer will enter with his whole heart into the spirit of the thing and teach the lads that drilling is a privilege everything will be well with the system. Senator McColl has referred to the awful crime of herding the boys together. He forgets the object of the association.

The lads have to stand together, and those who were born with a silver spoon in their mouth think that they are placed in an inferior position when they are required to mix with the sons of labourers, and the sons of poor widows. If this military training will do one thing it will help to stamp out that feeling of caste which has prevailed so long here, and which has ruined other lands. I desired to see in Australia an Army different from that of the Old Land. I wanted to see a citizen force from which caste would disappear, but I am sorry to say that it is slowly and surely making headway. To-day, if a man does not happen to be in a select social circle, no matter how good he is, no matter what examination he has passed or how clever he is, he finds it three or ten times harder to get promotion than does a man who mixes in society circles. I give a note of warning to the Government that, if they want to insure the success of the scheme that differential treatment must be wiped out. It is said that we cannot find any Australians to man our Fleet. It is hard to bring Australians down to what men have to stand in the Navy of the Old Land and other navies. It is hard to break the spirit of the Australian. But let him know that he is in exactly the same position as the best on the vessel, though holding a humbler position in life; let him know that one man is as good as another, and you will find that the Australian will be ever ready to take his place in the front fighting line, not only on the land, but at sea. I hope the Government will do something to render it possible for the sons of working men to rise from the ranks. Of course, it is not impossible for them to do so at present, but very few working men are able so to educate their sons that they can, under present conditions, rise to the highest positions in the Australian Army. I do not intend to add further to the debate, and should not have spoken at all except for the assertions made as to the position of the trade unions in Sydney in regard to the immigration proposals of the Government.

There has been for some little time past a movement on foot, which has now taken practical shape, to endeavour to provide a daily newspaper which shall voice the views of the Democracy of this country more effectively than they are voiced in any_existing journals. Whilst many such attempts have been made in past years, the present effort is, I believe - indeed, I have reason to know - one which is on a solid basis, and will result in something substantial at no distant date. Why is it that the workers of this country are spontaneously clubbing their money together - taking cash from their small and hard earnings - in order to establish . a Labour daily newspaper to voice their opinions?

There is none in Sydney, Melbourne, or Brisbane. That means that over 1,000,000 inhabitants of this Continent are without any method of obtaining fair and full expression of their views on political subjects. The Leader of the Opposition stated that money was being extorted from men by a levy in order to raise the necessary funds. The union to which I belong has. already contributed over £30,000, and there has not been one instance of illegitimate pressure or legal proceedings to procure that sum. When the members of one .organization alone are prepared to contribute that amount of money, it shows that they not only desire to have a daily Labour newspaper, but are prepared to make sacrifices for it.

The unfairness of the daily newspaper press of Australia does not lie in the fact that they refuse to report the utterances of the prominent men of the Labour side of politics. The public demand is so great that they dare not refuse to report these views through the medium of their news columns. The unfairness lies, not merely in their leading articles, but in their comments which frequently accompany their statements of news, and which are so coloured with prejudice, and so full of misrepresentation, that the whole of public opinion is more or less tainted and attempted to be corrupted. Commencing close at home, with the press of this State of Victoria, let me take an instance. During the progress of the Referenda Bills through both Houses- of this Parliament, one powerful newspaper in the city, the Age , cordially supported the proposals of the present Government. The Age published leading articles, comments, and criticism; and in every case made strenuous endeavours to destroy the arguments brought forward by Messrs.

The law was declared ultra vires by the High Court, and it is this which is now sought to be amended, so that in giving to a Federal Court the right to deal with industrial disputes the power would be quite plenary in all branches of labour. Sir William Lyne asked, ' Why should not railway men have the same rights and privileges all over Australia as other workmen have?' There may be 500,000 workers who will come under the cognisance of the Federal Courts. On what grounds should railway servants be excluded? To say that because the State pays the salaries it must have the right to prescribe the conditions of service is contrary to the very principle that guides all industrial legislation. Mine-owners pay miners' wages, factory-owners pay the wages of factory hands, contractors pay the wages of artisans and builders, but none of these employers have the power of fixing the rates of pay and the conditions of labour. The Stale would merely stand in the same position as any other great employer. The Federal Courts would decide disputes, and prevent the recurrence of strikes by the strong hand.

Mr. Deakin contends that no national Parliament can take proper cognisance of industrial conditions in a country as wide in area as Australia, where one part is in the tropics and another on the confines of the temperate and frigid zones- But, as Mr. Sampson pointed out, .the State of Western Australia embraces all those extremes, and no one has yet affirmed the inability of that State to regulate the wages of its workmen or the conditions of its trade. Moreover, concerning the allegations that these industrial powers are too large to give to the Commonwealth, it is enough to answer that every Federation in the world possesses them save America and Australia. And what is more, there is no other Federation in which the national powers are so limited as they are in this Commonwealth.

To that he replied, 'Yes, but in this Bill you will put four amendments into one group and compel electors to take all or none.' The answer to this is that there are two Referendum Bills. One deals with the enlargement of the Federal powers on industrial matters, the other gives power to the Commonwealth to nationalize monopolies. The four amendments relating to trade and commerce, corporations, industrial disputes, and trusts and combinations are simply various phases of one question. They hinge upon one another, and to a large extent are interdependent. To put them in the shape of four separate referendums would complicate and embarrass what is in itself a simple proposition.

A ' violent mob ' was said to have been in ' full possession ' of the town, and of the whole of the ironworks (barring the blast furnace), from 10 p.m. the previous night till the time the Telegraph went to press.

Last year the Sydney Morning Herald used ' Billingsgate ' concerning myself, in regard to the vote I gave on the Federal Capital. All these newspapers that profess such a high moral tone are themselves the biggest offenders against fair play and the judicial treatment of matters affecting the public interest, in which the Labour party are concerned. They might well, instead of complaining of the yellow journalism of America, put their own houses in order. Failing any hope that they will do such a thing, it is only natural that the democratic elements in this country should endeavour to provide themselves with a daily press, which will fairly record the doings and aspirations of the party to which they belong.

Senator RAE. - There is not very much occasion for them to report the honorable senator's side, because, in the first place, the existing daily newspapers do that, and even improve upon the speeches of honorable senators opposite. So that a measure of fair play will be brought about if we can establish newspapers which will do us a like service. I am not blaming the daily newspapers for this course of conduct because of any hope I ever held that they would act differently. I should deem it as illogical to cast any considerable amount of blame upon them as it would be to blame a black snake for being venomous. It is 'the way he is built. The newspaper press of Australia at the present time is dependent for its existence upon the commercial and financial interests which our party is out to deal with. Naturally being dependent upon those interests as against the interests of the whole community, and being a product of this commercial age, and a mighty bad product at that, it has to play up to those who are its support. We can, therefore, expect no reliability or stability in the course taken by the daily press at any time. It must adopt a political course in accordance with its pecuniary interests. That being so, I say that one of the greatest blessings this continent can experience will be brought about when we are enabled- to launch a daily newspaper press which will be absolutely free from commercial influences of that kind, because 'it will be owned and controlled by the Labour organizations of this country. I am very glad indeed to be able to inform my honorable friends opposite that we have already in hand for the purpose a sum approaching ,£40,000, with another £40,000 or £50,000 in sight, and we hope soon to have a daily newspaper in full going order.  My honorable friends will have a big, flourishing, financial corporation.

Referring now to the Governor-General's Speech, I should like to say something with regard to the paragraph dealing with the Imperial Conference. I hope that the good results foreshadowed will be realized. In connexion with the reference to the new Naval Agreement, arrived at after a Conference between the Commonwealth representatives and the Admiralty. I should like to express my disappointment that it has been agreed that the discipline and methods adopted in our Australian Unit are to be precisely the same as those adopted in the Imperial Fleet. I can quite understand that uniformity of equipment, and that kind of thing, would facilitate combined action by the various units of the Fleet if ever, unfortunately, it should be necessary for them to act together. But I feel that if we are to adopt a precise copy of the British regulations and methods of discipline, we shall find it extremely difficult to recruit Australians for service in our Navy.' 1 submit to the Minister of Defence that, while on broad general grounds it is no doubt highly advisable that we should run on common lines with the  Admiralty, we shall find it very difficult to get Australians to enter our naval service if they may be subjected to the kind of thing which I know from friends and relatives who served in the British Navy was common in that Navy a few years ago.

We know that with all its high traditions sections of the British Navy have mutinied in past generations, and in the present generation there has been a close approach to mutiny on many occasions, due to the exercise of a certain amount of unnecessary tyranny and unfairness by superior officers in the management of the men. I trust we shall never allow anything of that kind to grow up in our Navy. At the same time, 1 am not one who believes in any namby-pamby sentimentalism in the management and control of any of our public services.

One matter referred to in the Governor-General's  Speech is the establishment of the Federal Capital. I was one of those who, last session, voted against the choice of Canberra for the Capital site. If it had not been irrevocably settled, I should have been prepared, on any future occasion, to do the same thing; but I contend that the site having been fixed by the only method known to Parliament - a majority vote in both Houses - the opposition to the building of the Capital at Canberra on the part of some of my Victorian friends on both sides in this Chamber is unwarranted. Having decided once and for all upon the selection of a particular site, the sooner we accomplish the object for which the Federal Capital was designed the better. I shall, therefore, on no occasion be found in opposition to a proposal for the expenditure of the money necessary to give effect to the wishes' of the Parliament in establishing the Capital. I believe that the amount offered by the Government for the best design for the Federal City is totally inadequate to secure the best results. I have told the Minister of Home Affairs that, in my opinion, to give ,£25,000 for the best de-, sign for a Capital city, on which millions of pounds will ultimately be expended, would be money well spent if it secured for us a first-class. design. It would be a mere bagatelle compared with the results which might follow from its expenditure. It is no disparagement to Australian intelligence to say that in this country we have never had an opportunity of doing much in the planning of cities, and we should take advantage of the experience of ' people in the older countries of the world, and, that being so, I contend that we should make a magnificent offer so as to attract the best talent, because no country in the world can be always planning a new Capital. Such an opportunity will probably never arise again, and we should endeavour to obtain the most up-to-date plan for a Capital which the mind of man is capable of evolving. This is the first time in the history of the world when one nation has owned a whole continent, and has been able to create a city at its own will for the purpose of a Capital. It should be a city which will be an object of pride, and I might almost say of veneration to future generations of Australians. For that reason I think that the amount offered for the best design is ridiculously small and mean. If it should fail to bring forth a design which can be approved of, I trust that renewed efforts will be, made, and that a much more generous prize will be offered. I also believe that each House of this Parliament should have an opportunity of examining and approving of a design before it is adopted by the Government. It is not a matter for mere Cabinet decision, and, therefore, Parliament should have an opportunity of expressing an opinion on whatever designs may be submitted before we are committed to any particular one. In regard to the Tariff, at the referendum I made an uncompromising statement to the effect that I would oppose any alterations in the direction of affording more Protection to any industries until we had secured the power to give effect to what is known as the new Protection. While some of my colleagues on this side differ from me, I am still of that opinion. I think - and I believe, it is founded on a common-sense view of the matter - that if the manufacturers want to get more protection, they should enlist themselves on1 our side hi fighting for those amendments of the Constitution which will enable us to enact the new Protection.

If all Protectionists in the world think differently I cannot help that : they are wrong, evidently. Does it not stand to reason that if you proceed to enact a scientific Tariff - a thing which I believe to be a myth - or the nearest approach you can get to it, the manufacturers will probably say, ' We have obtained, if not all we want, all we can expect, and now we will strenuously range ourselves against the Commonwealth having power to hand any of our profits over to the workers.' As a matter of pure tactics I think it would be idiotic on our part to give them another copper until they help us, or abstain from opposing us, in the demands we are making  ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[7]/continue[26]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The recognition by a whole community that a fiscal law is not meant for the benefit of one small section only, but is avowedly meant, even if it is not accomplished, to benefit the workers in the industries, as well as those who scoop the profits, is of itself a valuable one, and I shall demand that (recognition before 1 shall concede a single point.

A law is a fraud when the chief provisions which would have given it life are withheld. Of course, I go further than do many of my honorable friends, and believe that the basis' of this law is wrong. In the Arbitration Act of New Zealand, they openly started with the advocacy of organization. They recognised that the law was for the purpose of the better organization of labour, or- used words to that effect, and they encouraged organization under the law. We, on the other hand, did not specifically do anything of that kind. We went out of our way to give opportunities to non-unionists to avail themselves of the law to some extent. But I go further than that, and say that an arbitration law, in order to be effective, should not attempt to do any of those Aim flam things which mob orators enunciate, about holding the scales evenly, and all that kind of pathetic claptrap. What we want is an arbitration law which sets out to do, by legal . and peaceful means, what we, as a Labour party, exists for, and that is to secure the wealth of the world for the world's wealth producers. An arbitration law should be a means to secure to the workers, by peaceful means, an ever increasing share of the wealth which they produce. That is what we are out for. Why disguise it in any way?

An arbitration law of that kind is not of very much use to me, nor do I believe it will be to the workers. Manifestly, they want better conditions. They want an arbitration law to secure to them by peaceful means what they succeeded in getting before by strikes. If it is not going to do as much for them as strikes did, then we do not want it. We want means which will give us most of that which we, as wealth producers, are entitled to, and if one way will not do that, we naturally resort to the other. Whether my fellow-members share these opinions or not, those are the lines on which I have always gone. I know that if you have a strike, you have to resort to arbitration sooner or later to determine the terms on which . you will settle. It is seldom that one side knocks out the other completely. They generally come to some kind of agreement as to the terms on which work shall be resumed. It is better, I think, to arbitrate before you fight than to do so after damage has been done. If we, as a class, are to gain anything by arbitration, we shall have to try a more effective scheme. It is a labour measure for the benefit of the workers, not for the benefit of the class represented by honorable senators on the other side, who have been getting the benefit all the time. If they do not like that sentiment, I cannot help it. I contend that the methods of arbitration, so far, . have been ineffective, because they have not recognised that this is an age in which the workers have awakened to the fact that they have been far too long the slaves of a class who have robbed them from the cradle to the grave. It is slowly dawning upon them that they possess the numerical and physical power to alter that state of things. In this country the workers have attained political power, and once they form an effective combination, there is absolutely nothing to prevent them from getting all their demands complied with. If the Parliament is not prepared to frame measures which will give them slowly, but surely, a constantly increasing instalment of the wealth they produce, then it will naturally goad them into such a state that they will turn round and take the lot. For the protection of the class for which my Conservative friends opposite -attempt to legislate, they should be foremost in advocating this peaceful means of securing justice to the workers, knowing that that is the only way to avert revolution.

The honorable senator will find that, if the parties agree, or if the Judge so orders, lawyers may be admitted. Indeed, I know that that is so, because in a case which was tried by Mr. Justice O'Connor four years ago we sought, prior to the trial corning on, to prevent the pastoralists getting leave to employ counsel, and the Judge granted leave, in spite of our opposition. That having been done, of course we then secured the best counsel we could. The present  High Commissioner represented us, and put up a very decent fight for us, getting well paid for it, of course. He even advocated preference to unionists, notwithstanding our political objects.

We have had to bring witnesses from every State in the Common-wealth, except Western Australia, where an agreement at present exists, and have had in many cases to keep them for weeks, and that during the shearing season, when competent men would be earning the largest amounts that they earn at any time during the year. Thousands of documents have had to be prepared. All this costs an enormous amount of money, and I say deliberately that something approximating . £6,000 has been spent on this case up to date.- I now ask leave to continue my remarks to-morrow. Leave granted; debate adjourned.  ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[7]/continue[39]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"
