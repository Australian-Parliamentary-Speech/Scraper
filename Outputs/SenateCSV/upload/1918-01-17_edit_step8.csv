At the same time it is reasonable to assume that another place will have completed the important business on which it is now engaged, and will also have passed the Supply Bill, which is next on the business-paper there, by the termination of this week. Ordinarily, we should meet again on Wednesday next, but I am taking the liberty of inviting honorable senators to meet a day earlier. I am satisfied that the Supply Bill will be before us then, and we shall thus be able to deal with it a day earlier than if we adopted the usual course.

I listened to the list of regulations under the War Precautions Act as read out by the Leader of the Senate. I noticed that he went to No. 322, then back to No. 264, and then jumped in stages up to 326. So far as I could ascertain before the Senate met, No. 325 has not yet been tabled. It is not fair for the Government to withhold it until the closing hours, or minutes, of a session, as has been done on previous occasions. My inquiries as to the tabling were hurried, and it may already have been put before the Senate; but if it has not, the Government ought, at the first opportunity, even before this sitting terminates, to put it before the Senate.. It has been in honorable senators'' boxes for some time, and the order in the Government Gazette, following the issue of that regulation on 11th December, has been published in the newspapers. I am sure honorable senators would welcome the opportunity of saying whether they indorse the action of the Government, the Prime Minister, or the Attorney-General, in going to the extent of the action taken on that occasion. The general impression appears to be that the constitution of this police force in Queensland has been one of the greatest farces perpetrated since the inception of the Commonwealth, and it is due to honorable senators opposite, as well as to those on this side, to be allowed an opportunity to say whether they are prepared to back up the continuance of that farce or not. If the Government are not prepared to table the regulation at once they should end the farce, which has gone much too far.
