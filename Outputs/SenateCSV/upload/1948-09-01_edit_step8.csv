Under the agreement with the International Refugee Organization, the Commonwealth proposed to absorb 12,000 of these persons a year. The first several thousand arrivals have proved so satisfactory that the Commonwealth will absorb as many more of these worthy persons as shipping can be provided for.","N/A","HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/list[6]/item[23]/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The act has received Royal Assent and will come into force on 1st January, 1949. During the present session my Government will introduce similar legislation adapted to meet Australian conditions. My Government considers that legislation on these lines will have many advantages over existing nationality law. It will in no way interfere with the status of British subjects now possessed by all Australians and, by determining who are Australian citizens, it will clarify the position in relation to persons entitled to Australian diplomatic protection. It will also enable my Government, when making treaties with other countries, to define with precision who are the persons belonging to this country and on whose behalf it is negotiating.","N/A","HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/list[6]/item[25]/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"
