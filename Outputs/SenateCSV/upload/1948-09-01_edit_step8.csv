The act has received Royal Assent and will come into force on 1st January, 1949. During the present session my Government will introduce similar legislation adapted to meet Australian conditions. My Government considers that legislation on these lines will have many advantages over existing nationality law. It will in no way interfere with the status of British subjects now possessed by all Australians and, by determining who are Australian citizens, it will clarify the position in relation to persons entitled to Australian diplomatic protection. It will also enable my Government, when making treaties with other countries, to define with precision who are the persons belonging to this country and on whose behalf it is negotiating.","N/A","HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/list[6]/item[25]/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Several problems are associated with television and, so that the whole matter may be studied by my Government, the Post Office has been authorized to invite tenders for two stations for installation in Sydney and Melbourne and, alternatively, for six stations for erection in all the State capital cities.
