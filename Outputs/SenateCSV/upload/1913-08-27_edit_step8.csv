In fact, the amount asked for in the Bill is under £1,000,000. The present Treasurer has always been in the habit of discounting even millions; therefore, I am surprised that the Government did not ask for a little over £1,000,000. I would not have been surprised if a request had been made for two months' supply. I think that that would have been a reasonable request, because of the very large amount which is set down for a Treasurer's Advance. A quarter of a million for a Treasurer's Advance in a month's supply seems rather extraordinary; it alarms me to a considerable extent that such a request should be made. In the days that have gone I heard honorable senators opposite ask why ' ' this very large amount' was required. Even a smaller amount than £250,000 was deemed extraordinary by them as a Treasurer's Advance. We used to be asked whether a Treasurer's Advance was required for the purpose of carrying on some Socialistic enterprises, and I am wondering whether this £250,000 is not being placed at the disposal of the Treasurer for the purpose of carrying on some wild-cat anti-Socialistic scheme in the future. But be that as it may, if the Opposition in the House of Representatives were prepared to give him £250,000 to play with, I do not think that we in the Senate ought to be very much alarmed. Even that item may be passed as fairly formal. Hoping that the Treasurer and the Government generally will be careful with 'this very large amount,' and discriminate in what they do with it, I do not oppose the motion. Senator FINDLEY (Victoria} [4.47].- Earlier in the sitting I questioned the Vice-President of the Executive Council in regard to a statement he made on the last day of sitting, and the Leader of the Government, on his behalf, said it was customary, when a no-confidence motion was before another place, for the representatives of the Government in this Chamber not to answer any questions.

There has not been a tittle of evidence to justify that statement made by Senator McColl. I said on the last day the Senate sat that in the circumstances he ought to have had the common decency to await the result of the Government inquiry before making the statements as published in the daily newspapers. I feel sure that members of the Cabinet could not have been pleased with his utterances on that occasion. He said, 'they were going straight ahead.' The first time he attempted to go ahead he bumped his head against a wall, and it has been hurting him ever since, and will continue to hurt him. He said that we had ' resurrected the dead.' One would think from his remarks that the Fusion, or so-called Liberal, party is endowed with every virtue and exempt from every vice, that they are a party incapable of wrong-doing, and that the only persons who did anything wrong at the recent elections were the members of the Labour party. When Senator McColl anticipated that he was not going to be elected, common rumour had it that he went round mouthing to different people that his defeat was the result of organized corruption. He further had a consultation with the Government Statistician. I am extremely anxious, and so is every fair-minded man and woman in this community, to see what the statement of Mr. Knibbs really was. I have my doubts that Mr. Knibbs made the statement which Senator McColl attributed to him. What was the statement that the latter made? He said that there were more names on the rolls than there were persons entitled to vote, and that he had the figures from Mr. Knibbs. He made Mr. Knibbs, the Government Statistician, say that there were 60,000 more people on the rolls of New South Wales than were entitled to vote.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I make bold to say that Mr. Knibbs never made such statements. I have no doubt that Senator McColl consulted Mr. Knibbs, and wis supplied with certain figures, and then he read into the statement that this immense army in the different States, totalling many thousands, had either voted twice or personated others.

During the past five weeks Ministers have been travelling through the country, making all sorts of statements, which have been ably backed up by the press in every instance. Since we last met, the Prime Minister stated on one occasion that, so far as any legislative work is concerned, the Government are powerless. But lie also added that they would make up for that deficiency in the administration of their respective Departments, where, as Ministers, they would be untrammelled. I venture to say that the Prime Minister and his colleagues have carried out their intention. A little while ago the Minister of Defence visited Ballarat, where he made a certain statement with his tongue in his cheek. He said that, in view of the fact that a no-confidence motion was impending, he could not discuss controversial politics; but in the same breath - and I wish he were present in his place in this chamber - he reflected somewhat on the composition of the Senate by describing it as undemocratic. The honorable senator has been a member of this Chamber since 1901. At that time there was not a preponderance of Labour members in the Senate.

Did not a similar position obtain then with a majority of anti-Labour senators, and was the Senate then described as an undemocratic assembly? I would ask Senator Gould, notwithstanding the legal acumen and political experience of which he is possessed, to refresh his memory on the subject. I desire now to refer to one or two administrative acts of the present Government. I had occasion, a few weeks ago, to interview the Minister of Defence in regard to the cessation of work at the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound, Fremantle, as the result of a telegram which I had received from the present representative for that constituency, Mr. Burchell. The Minister met me very courteously, and informed me that, on account of the uncertainty which obtained regarding the exact locality of the base, it had been determined that all the land work then in progress should be finished, but that no further land work would be undertaken until the present survey had been completed. I accepted his statement, and despatched a telegram to that effect to Mr. Burchell, which telegram, the Minister will doubtless recollect, I read to him. I was assured that the surveyors would be retained until the present survey had been completed, and that work would then be continued in accordance with the plans of that survey. I am very much surprised to find that since then surveyors, as well as other workmen, have been dismissed. In the statement which the Minister made to me in his office in all good faith, I was led to believe that all the surveyors engaged on the present survey would be retained, and that when they had completed that survey to the satisfaction of the Government, other work would be proceeded with. In these circumstances, I am indeed surprised to learn that two surveyors were dismissed last week. I am informed that there are others to follow. I hope that the Minister in his reply, upon the first reading of this Bill, will say whether or not my information is correct. A remarkable feature about this matter is that at the last general elections in Western Australia we were met on almost every platform by statements of the present Treasurer, the ex-representative of Fremantle, Mr. Hedges, and the honorable member for Perth, Mr. Fowler, to the effect that work at the Naval Base was not being pushed on with fast enough; that the Labour Ministry were dilly-dallying with matters there; that they were not carrying out the recommendations of Admiral Henderson; and that they were making a ' ' holy mess ' of the entire position. The Ministry were attacked - the ex-Minister of Defence was attacked - by them, and only a few days after the present Government had been installed in office, Mr. Fowler found it convenient to declare, in a statement which he made to the press, that he would see that the work at the Naval Base w.as now pushed on with more rapidly. How has it been pushed on with more rapidly? By the dismissal of eighty-five men during the period that the present Government have been in office. There is another matter to which I desire to call the attention of the Senate. The present Minister of Defence has his Naval Board - his experts. All previous Ministers of Defence have had theirs, and it is somewhat remarkable that the present Minister should be setting up a different condition of things altogether from that which was recommended by Admiral Henderson. Either his action is a veiled attack on the desire of Australia to establish an Australian Navy-","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I will accept the honorable senator's explanation, but I would ask him to read up Hansard, and he will there discover his mistake. There is this other phase of the question. The Minister the other day said that it was the desire of the Government to obtain scientific opinion as to whether or not Cockburn Sound was a suitable place for a Naval Base. Since Admiral Henderson was here the Commonwealth Government have been advised by several scientific men. The action of the Government in practically stopping all work at the Naval Base is either an insult to Admiral Henderson or to the experts who have been advising the Department during the past few years. I venture to say that the Government ought to have considered very carefully indeed whether they should persist in the policy laid down in connexion with the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound. Some time last year a number of men engaged at the work there, having some idea that there was to be continuity of employment, removed their homes from distant parts of the State in order to live adjacent to the works. These men now find themselves out of employment, and will again have to remove their homes. The whole business is uncertain. I can see no solid reason for changing the procedure and policy adopted by the predecessors of the present Government. Again, in connexion with the trans-Australian railway, we were faced with a statement from our opponents, during the last election, that we were not pushing on with the work with sufficient rapidity. Since the advent of the new Ministry I find that a number of men have been dismissed from the Kalgoorlie end of the railway, including the engineer, Mr. Chinn. It is a remarkable thing that during the elections we found our opponents saying everything they possibly could to destroy our chance of success in connexion with the administration of that line. They even went so far as to say that some machinery which had been purchased for use at both ends was obsolete. But since the advent of Mr. Kelly to the Home Affairs Department as Assistant Minister, we learn that the machinery which his colleague, Sir John Forrest, condemned on the platform has been found to be absolutely perfect. Take the steam shovel at the Port Augusta end of the line. It was condemned as a useless instrument, and it was said that the money expended upon it had been wasted. Such a mistake, it was said, could only have been made by a Labour Ministry.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In Mr. Deane's report (as consulting engineer) of September 20,1911, presented to Parliament at the time of the passing of the Bill to authorize the construction of the line, it was recommended that the proper way to proceed was to spend the first year collecting plant and materials, and, at the same time, doing what work was necessary in the way of formation of depôts at each end of the route. After the first 12 months had elapsed, and plant and material had been collected, would be the time to push forward with the real work of construction. Owing to the press of work in railway construction throughout Australia, it was found impracticable to buy suitable rolling stock, new or even second-hand, and, consequently, a staff of draughtsmen had to be established to work out designs of the requisite rolling stock, and early in1912 steps were taken to this end. A suitable senior draughtsman, recommended by the late chief mechanical engineer of the Victorian Railways, was selected, but he subsequently withdrew, because, under the provisions of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Act, there could be no certainty of continuous, not to say permanent, employment. The position was then advertised, and eventually, on May 6, 1912, an appointment was made.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/quote[1]/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The Labour party are to blame for everything. This was a big issue at the elections. No one knows better than honorable senators opposite, however, that the Labour party had nothing at all to do with the increased cost of living. They know perfectly well that it was the Labour party which asked for certain powers to be intrusted to this Parliament, in order that we might deal with combinations and monopolies, that are certainly responsible, in a great degree, for the increased cost of living. Honorable senators opposite opposed that policy, and the people of Australia, in their judgment, rejected our proposals for the time being.

Let me read an extract, not from a Labour newspaper, but from the Argus of the 5th July, 1913. It is headed, 'Inter-State freights; increase of 15 per cent.' Merchants and manufacturers are complaining of a further increase in Inter-State freights by the steam-ship companies. In the past the practice has been to make small advances of 5 per cent, or less, but this latest jump is one of 15 per cent., making a total of 20 per cent, in the last six months. Business men regard the increase with alarm, and state that it will seriously affect the Inter-State trade. Even if it does not lead to the curtailment of imports and exports, it will necessitate higher prices being charged for goods, with a corresponding upward tendency in the cost of living. The present rates compare with those previously charged as follows : - - The shipping companies state that the advance has been made necessary because many vessels are running practically empty owing to the outbreak of small-pox. The advanced rates apply, not to cargo shipped on vessels trading to the infected city, but to goods consigned to any port in Australia, from Geraldton to Cairns. Commenting on the new freights yesterday, a Melbourne merchant said : - ' This will mean a large addition to our expenditure, but what are we to do? The companies have the monopoly of the Inter-State trade, and appear to have an understanding ' regarding freights and fares which does away with competition. Therefore we are wholly in their hands. We recognise that during the last few years they have been compelled to pay large increases in wages to their crews, but an increase of 5 per cent, was made to cover that. However, as they have seen fit to charge an additional 20 per cent, for the carriage of goods, we must pay it, and pass the increase on to the public.'*","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","180","NEEDHAM, Edward","JXJ","N/A","N/A","N/A","502","I intend only to make a passing reference to it. The Government propose to abolish preference to unionists, but there is a body known as the Independent Workers Union in existence in Australia, the secretary of which is Packer. They say that they are against preference to unionists, and they have established labour bureaus throughout the Commonwealth, aided and abetted through their federation by the employers of the Commonwealth. I have read a circular issued under the authority and seal of the Employers Federation, in which it is stated that the Independent Workers Union, through its secretary or secretaries, will procure employment for men or women, but before they start work they must pay an entrance fee to that organization, and pledge themselves to pay 6d. per week, otherwise employment will not be found for them. Is that not preference to non-unionists? I think it is. When the Government talk of freedom and equality, let me say that whilst the miner, bricklayer, mason, and other artisans in the Commonwealth may approach the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Government say to the farm labourer, ' You are not to have an opportunity to obtain justice.' The farm labourer may starve, or eke out a miserable subsistence on an alleged wage: but if he says, 'With my fellows I will combine; we will form ourselves into an organization, seek registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and approach the Court,' the Government say, 'No, you must not do it,' If this is the attitude which the Government propose to adopt, it amounts to a contention that the farm labourer is made of some different kind of flesh and blood from the artisan. If the Government propose to adopt such a system I venture to say that when they submit themselves to the will of the people they will find it necessary to change their opinions in this respect. This is the kind of liberty, equalty, and freedom that Senators Clemons, McColl, and Millen, as Ministers of the Crown, are preaching to-day. In proposing the abolition of preference to unionists, Ministers are up against something very much bigger than they anticipate. The desire of those belonging to the industrial world of Australia today, of all political views, is to settle industrial troubles, not by the cruel weapon of the strike, but by the more pacific method of arbitration. If the Government persist in what they have set out to do, they will invite the workers of Australia to discard the weapon of conciliation and arbitration, and resort again to the weapon of the strike.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[29]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I say that the Government propose to amend the Maternity Allowance Act by refusing the allowance to some mothers of children born in Australia. Setting aside the document to which I have referred, that I may be quite within the bounds of order, let me say that Mr. Gregory, the member for Dampier, when asked a few weeks ago whether he was in favour of an amendment of the Act, said ' yes.' When he was asked in what direction he would amend the Act, he said he would not be in favour of paying the allowance to the rich mother as well as to the poor mother, and he would seek to amend the Act in that direction. Further, the Prime Minister - and other members of the Ministry - and Mr. Gregory have said that they object to the poor being taxed to give something to the rich. I am surprised at this sudden solicitude for the poor. I have never heard either of these honorable gentlemen express any anxiety about the poor of Australia being taxed to give retiring pensions to Judges or highly-paid public servants. Still, they object to the poor being taxed in the direction of a maternity allowance. I suppose that the argument which can be adduced for paying pensions to Judges and highly-paid public officers is that they have rendered good services to the State. I admit that probably they have done so; and I, for one, agree that when they retire from their high positions they should get some recognition. But if that is the only reason actuating them in connexion with the maternity allowance, I ask the Ministry : Who renders the greater service to the State - a woman who presents another citizen in the person of a child, or a Judge or highly-paid officer? Naturally,, the mother renders the greater service; and that being so, there should be no distinction drawn. I know that most of the mothers of Australia have availed themselves of the provisions of the Maternity Allowance Act; but I venture to add that, had there been the slightest taint of charity about the Act, many mothers would not have availed themselves of its provisions. They have availed themselves of the maternity allowance because they knew that it was not a charity but a right to which every mother in Australia was entitled. If the Government attempt, as I believe they will attempt, to amend the Act in the direction they have intimated, it will receive strenuous opposition from me. I desire to refer to one or two other matters. The question of immigration, I understand, is engaging the attention of the Ministry, and it is proposed to confer with the State Premiers with the view to make some satisfactory arrangements here and in London. The question of immigration, I venture to submit, is a very important one to Australia; but the present system is not giving satisfactory results. Here we find six States competing in London for immigrants, and practically one decrying the other. Again, we find that the immigration agents of one State are being paid so much for every immigrant whom they can induce to come to our shores.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[33]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

If it is necessary that there should be immigration officers, let them be paid a proper salary; and whether they get one or a hundred people to come to our shores, let that proper salary be paid. I will make a suggestion to the Ministry for what it is worth.

The rush for vaccination here a few weeks ago was owing to a passenger by the Karoola having escaped detection by the quarantine authorities. While this State has been immune, so far, from any local case, I wonder how long it will remain immune under present quarantine conditions. A person from the proclaimed area in Sydney cannot cross the Victorian border unless he produces a successful certificate of vaccination. I am not a lover or an advocate of vaccination. I am an antivac.cinationist, but I will not obtrude my opinion just now. I only want to point out that vaccination without fumigation is absolutely useless. The authorities compel a man or a woman from Sydney to produce at the border a certificate of successful vaccination, and when that demand is complied with, passengers can go on their way rejoicing, but carrying perhaps myriads of microbes in their handbags, or on their clothing, and letting them loose in this State, or other- parts of the Commonwealth. Any one who considers this question seriously will recognise at once that vaccination alone is not sufficient to prevent the spread of small-pox. The baggage of travellers ought to be fumigated. I hope that some of the matters that I have referred to - in particular the naval base, transcontinental railway, and immigration - are of sufficient importance in. the eyes of Senator Clemons for him to state the opinion of the Ministry as regards the suggestions I have offered.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[35]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

As the result of the inquiry which has been held, they have disproved it, as I shall show before I have concluded my remarks. I have here a memorandum by the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, which reads - Tn response to the inquiry of the Hon. the Attorney-General as to whether the number of apparent cases of duplication of voting at the recent elections is in excess of the number of errors which officers might make in marking the certified lists of voters owing to misunderstanding or lack of care, I desire to state that it is somewhat difficult to give a definite reply. While the average number of apparent duplications is less than three per 1,000 voters, it will be noticed that in one division (Ballarat) the number reaches 175 in a poll of 32,818, and that in another division (Macquarie) the number falls to 11 in a poll of 23,323. A review of the Ballarat lists discloses that many names which have been marked twice are followed on the rolls by identical or similar names which have not been marked. There is reasonable ground in cases of this kind for assuming that there have been errors in marking. In divisions in which the elections were keenly contested and the polling was exceptionally heavy, it might be expected that more names would be inadvertently marked in error than in the other divisions, but much would, of course, depend upon the care with which individual officers performed their duties. While a margin of between two and three errors per 1,000 voters would not appear to be excessive, having regard to the number of similar names appearing on the rolls, it could not of course be assumed that, where the average is either above or below, fraud either has or has not entered into the elections. In some divisions the whole of the apparent duplications could probably be cleared up without disclosing any fraud. In other cases a prolonged investigation, involving the tracing of the movements on polling-day of the persons concerned, would be necessary before an official pronouncement could be made. I have obtained from the Electoral Office and from the Census Office the actual number of names on the rolls in the one case, and a rough and approximate estimate of the number of adults who were entitled to be enrolled for the last election in the other. I find that in New South Wales the number of electors on the certified lists at 31st May last was 1,036,187, whereas the adult population was 970,000, an excess of 66,187, or 6$ per cent. In Victoria, the number of electors on the certified lists was 830,391, whereas the population was set down at 768,000, an excess of 62,391, or 1\ per cent. In Queensland, the number of electors on the certified lists was 363,082, and the population was returned at 332,000, an excess of 31,082, or 8f per cent. In South Australia, the electors on the certified lists numbered 244,026, and the population was set down at 236,000, an excess of 8,026, or just under 4.14 per cent. In Western Australia, the number of electors on the certified lists was 179,784, and the population was set down at 169,000, an excess of 10,784, or 6 per cent. In Tasmania, the number of electors on the certified lists comprised 106,746, and the population was returned at 101,000, an excess of 5,746, or 5 per cent. It will thus be seen that the electors on the certified lists at 31st May of the present year totalled 2,760,216, whereas the population was set down at 2,576,000, an excess of 184,286, or 6 and two-thirds per cent. It must be remembered in that connexion that we have the most complete system of enrolment to be found in any portion of the British Empire.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The mail steamer will probably take 200 passengers there, the InterState vessels will convey some 600 or 700 more, and the mixed cargo steamers an additional 200 or 300. These vessels are generally full, and when we remember that all this migration takes place in regard to one State only we shall get some idea of the extent of the migration to various parts of Australia upon any one day in the year.

What was the object of honorable senators opposite and their party outside in attempting as they did to discredit the late Government by imputing all this dishonesty and corruption to a political party which has done more than any other party to drive out political corruption from the Parliaments of Australia? Simply to obtain, as they thought, a little political advantage by so doing. Now they are very anxious that the whole thing shall be forgotten. But we do not intend that it shall be, I think that a party that would stoop to that kind of conduct should not be permitted to let the charges which it has so recklessly made be hurriedly forgotten. The people should be reminded that the present Government, before any inquiry whatever was made - simply on the strength of allegations in newspapers - not only rushed in to attack their opponents, but made absolute charges of political dishonesty against them. Now they have had an official inquiry they find that the charges are entirely disproved, and some of them have had the honesty to admit that they were misled. Others, however, have refused to do so. Let us make an analysis of these apparent duplications, numbering 5,760 - that is to say, 3,146 ordinary votes and 2,614 absent votes. Fortunately we are able to let a little bit of light into this matter. I shall take this opportunity to repeat the challenge thrown down by Senator Needham, and will give proof that the duplications were not cases of intentional double voting, but, in many cases, were simply blunders made by officials. I have before me the report of one of the scrutineers present at the Fremantle election, representing Mr. Burchell. The return of the Electoral Department shows that in the Fremantle division there were 107 ordinary votes, and forty-nine absent votes, as to which there were apparent duplications. This is a very interesting case, or I should not venture to weary the Senate by quoting from this document, which is written by Mr. Bolton, M.L.A., who acted as Mr.' Burchell's representative at the scrutiny. He describes, first of all, the system adopted by the electoral officers in conducting the scrutiny. He says -","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The explanation of this appears to be in the system of checking the absent votes. The scrutiny of the actual declarations ought to prove that no elector received more than one ballot-paper for the House of Representatives' election. There are_ 27 of these cases which the suggested scrutiny of declarations should disprove. The official rolls also disclose that a number (51) of electors apparently voted under absent voting regulations, and also recorded a personal vote at the polling booth. Of this number 23 are doubtful, and appear to be mistakes of the poll clerks, leaving 28 to be accounted for or inquired into further bv the Electoral Department. In connexion with what are known as personal votes the clerical errors are more pronounced under the heading of ' Electors who are ticked off as having apparently voted more than once at the same booth.' These cases account for a great proportion of the whole queries in personal voting, and number 53. Most of the cases are obvious errors, as a reference to the names above or below those so double ticked will show, and are further accounted for by the presence of two poll clerks to one presiding officer in at least one polling booth. Of the above number, 15 are accounted for by the first reference and 17 b' the latter, i.e.. two poll clerks, leaving 21 to be accounted for or inquired into by the Electoral Department. To show how absurd the contention would be that electors voted twice in one and the same booth, I would mention that the official rolls disclose that two poll clerks, both employed in the same booth, apparently each voted twice in the booth where they were engaged. That is a very remarkable state of affairs, is it not? This clearly proves to my mind that my contention of carelessness or the ease with which clerical errors can be perpetrated is thoroughly justified. A number of electors are ticked off as apparently having voted at two different polling booths. These number 53, and aTe mostly accounted for by a reference to the name above or below the elector so double ticked. These account for 36 of the above number, leaving 17 not accounted for. The Electoral Department should be able to easily trace these 17 electors, when it will most probably be found that there have been few, if any, irregularities. I desire to quote one instance. The presiding officer at a polling booth is ticked ofl as having voted at the polling booth at which he presided and also at the polling booth in the district in which he resides, some miles distant. To sum up the position, I find that there were few (perhaps not a dozen) really apparently suspicious cases.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/quote[11]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Moreover, the practice that is followed is this : Before the election the presiding officers meet together and discuss their plans; so that, as a matter of fact, the presiding officers all know each other. This document goes on - At the same time let me say there are explanations that should be obtained by the Electoral Department from 66 electors. The significance of this particular scrutiny is that this is the very electorate as to which it was trumpeted throughout the Commonwealth that the Liberal party had absolute proof that there were no fewer than 2,000 duplications. They said they had absolute proof - that their scrutineers had been through the rolls, and had checked them, and could show that there had been wrong-doing. The Liberal press took up that statement. Sir John Forrest trumpeted it throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Fremantle was held up as the awful example in electoral matters. Here is the explanation; and we learn, on authority, that there were not more than a dozen cases of duplication in a constituency where the polling ran up to 12,000.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

But what do all these charges boil down to after investigation? They boil down to this: That the late Government knew the condition of the plant which they were taking over, that in the valuation upon which the dock was taken over every allowance was made for the value of machinery which was old and obsolete, and that, so far from being a bad bargain, the purchase was a very good one for the Commonwealth, and that we could get more than the value of our money tomorrow if we wished to dispose of the dock.

Only a few months ago the works were taken over from the N.S.W. State Government for purposes of warship construction. Now the new Minister for Defence pointedly infers, if not directly asserts, their inefficiency, declaring that a bad bargain has been made. After investigation we feel inclined to associate political motives with the Ministerial statement, though not debating the necessity of a thorough inspection of the boilers. Engineer G. A. Julius would appear to have made some serious allegations in his special report on the power plant, and while his judgment must be accorded every respect, it must be also borne in mind that the present decision has been arrived at as a result of a conference of the Minister and the Naval Board. Engineer-Superintendent Cutler pointed out in a daily press interview that the boilers had been inspected at Christmas. There may be some serious necessity for an immediate re-inspection as recommended by Mr. Julius, but we cannot conceive the necessity of the Minister for Defence exhibiting the spirit of political partisanship as he has done, and condemning the efficiency of the whole institution. It has been perfectly well understood all along that a new power plant was to be installed, and that the present boilers were being used at a safe low pressure in the interim. Superintendent-Engineer Cutler summarized the position well in the following statement : - The works were being closed temporarily to enable the boilers to be tested. This was being done to see which boilers would have to be renewed when the new power plant was installed. The new power plant was on the way, and had been arranged long ago.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/quote[12]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The report is dated 12th August, and is as follows: - Minute to the Director-General of Public Works. In compliance with the request of the Honorable the Minister for Public Works, that the members of the late Committee of Management of the Government Dockyards should report on certain statements which have appeared in the public press in connexion with the establishment at Cockatoo, and the construction of warships there, the Prime Minister is reported to have made the following statement : - ' We find that it is impossible to build the Cruiser Brisbane, now in course of construction there, without installing a lot of new machinery. That ought to have been ascertained before the work on it was begun. As it is, the building of that cruiser will be delayed three years, besides which we are faced with an additional expenditure of£350,000. There are also three destroyers to be constructed there. Possibly the works will be able to go on with them, but one cannot help thinking it would have been better to have had these ships built at Home, and to have set about installing the necessary plant for ship construction here, so that by the time those ships had been delivered we would have been in a position to build the rest of our own warships. The Commonwealth was charged . £870.000 for Cockatoo Dock, and finds after the purchase that it has to instal a lot of new machinery. It was bad business.' The Committee presume that the£350,000 referred to is set down as the additional cost of building the three destroyers and the cruiser in Sydney, as compared with the cost of the construction of similar vessels in England, but are at a loss to understand how that sum has been arrived at. From the inception of the proposal to construct our war vessels in Australia it has been recognised that the cost of so doing would be much greater than if the construction were carried out in established yards in Great Britain, in view of the fact that a higher rate of wages is paid in Australia, and also in view of the necessity for obtaining from Europe much of the material to be used in the construction. That this additional expense would be greater in the case of the first vessels constructed in Australia on account of similar work not having been previously undertaken is also self-evident. The whole of the facts bearing on this question were available to the expert advisers of the Commonwealth Government at the time of the contracts for the assembling of the Warrego, and the construction of three torpedo destroyers and the cruiser Brisbane were placed with the State Government of New South Wales. The advisableness of incurring this additional expenditure as an initial step towards enabling the Commonwealth to construct its own war vessels is a matter of policy intimately connected with the general question of Imperial defence, and the Committee do not consider it within their province to question the wisdom of the decision arrived at by the naval advisers of the Commonwealth Government, who had the advantage of the advice of His Majesty's Admiralty. Let me say that every one of these points was considered by the late Government. We, of course, knew that it would cost more to build ships here, and that new machinery would have to be added to the dockyard plant; but, notwithstanding that, we believed that the balance of advantage would be secured by commencing at the earliest possible date the construction of warships in the Commonwealth.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/para[26]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

This is not the case. Admiral Henderson, who reported to the Commonwealth Government upon the establishment of the Australian Navy, personally inspected the dockyard before any warship construction was undertaken there, and the Commonwealth authorities had his report to guide them. Subsequently, during the construction of the Warrego, the Commonwealth Naval authorities had officers stationed upon the island, and it was visited from time to time by their senior naval advisers. It was well known to the Commonwealth authorities that the dockyards were equipped for the docking of vessels, as well as the construction of dredge plant, and that modern machinery was required before the construction of warships could be undertaken; in fact, so recent are some of the improvements iu machinery used in such work that it would have been impossible to obtain it in years gone by, even had it been required for the purposes for which the dockyards were used in the past. Being fully seized of these facts, and having had experience of the work done by the Yard in the construction of the Warrego, the Commonwealth placed orders for three destroyer* and the cruiser Brisbane with the State Government; and, at a later date, took over the establishment on a valuation made by outside experts.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/quote[14]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

With regard to the action of the late Committee of Management when the construction of the vessels referred to above at the Dockyards was proposed, the Committee felt bound to express to the Government their opinion as to the suitability of the establishment for the construction of warships. The Committee do not consider it necessary to refer to their report on the subject, which was of a confidential nature, beyond stating that whatever information they had at that time was equally available to the Commonwealth authorities, whose expert advisers arc presumably equally competent with themselves to form an opinion. On receiving orders to proceed with the construction nf the warships, 'he Committee took the necessary steps to remodel the establishment for its new purpose, and obtained from one of the leading firms contracting for war vessels with the Admiralty, and with the advice and assistance of the Admiralty, experts to take charge of the various Departments under the SuperintendentEngineer. At the time when the Committee were relieved of the control of the establishment on its transfer to the Commonwealth Government, the Yard was being rapidly brought to a state of efficiency for dealing with the carrying out of the contract entrusted by the Commonwealth, and, having due regard to the delays incidental to obtaining the material and machinery required, matters were in satisfactory train for the completion of the work, and arrangements were complete for providing all the requisite modern machinery. For some time prior to the Committee being relieved of the management of the Dockyards in January last, their operations were hampered by considerations arising out of the then impending transfer, since which date the Committee have had no personal connexion with, or knowledge of, the progress of operations at the Yard; but the Committee confidently assert that at the time the negotiations for transfer commenced, they had taken every action necessary to bring the establishment and staff into a state of efficiency to deal with the work, and that they were fully competent to deal with all such matters as the renewal and repair of plant, boilers, &c., required for the execution of the work as and when occasion arose. Adverting to the criticism which has been levelled at the power plant, the Managing Committee soon after their creation recognised that this plant was not such as they considered suitable, and steps were taken by them to temporarily improve matters, pending the installation of a new plant on a more suitable site. As it would, however, answer the purpose for some little time, the money and energy at the Committee's disposal were devoted to the completion and equipment of the work-shops, and it was only at the end of last year that they felt it necessary to have the scheme thoroughly worked out, when plans were prepared and specifications drawn up for an up-to-date power plant. During the Committee's term of office, they, through their responsible officers, made due provision, by inspection and careful repair where necessary, for the protection and safety of their employés. Since the Committee were relieved of the management in January last, they understand the Commonwealth authorities have had under consideration the appointment of a new manager at the Dockyards, and, further, that many matters have remained in abeyance pending such appointment. That such a change was contemplated, and yet not made, may have militated against the successful working of the establishment. With regard to the price to be paid by the Commonwealth Government for the Dockyards, this was, as already stated, determined by mutual agreement. The Committee would point out that the establishment has a high commercial value, not only on account of its situation, but also in view of the fact that it contains the finest dock in Australia, apart from its value as a Naval construction yard; and, so far from considering the price to be paid excessive, the Committee consider that this State made a sacrifice, in the interests of the Commonwealth, in agreeing to the transfer under the terms arranged. To sum up the situation in the briefest possible terms : The Committee say that the conversion of these Dockyards into a Naval construction establishment, and the immediate initiation of warship building there - instead of waiting for the construction of new yards at another site - was undertaken by the Commonwealth authorities (presumably in consultation with the Admiralty) for the well-considered purpose of making a small beginning in the training of our men at such work at the only place in Australia where such an immediate beginning was possible; and this step, as well as the purchase of the Dockyards by the Commonwealth, was entered into with a full knowledge of the cost to the Commonwealth of taking such a step, and with a full reliance on the benefits thereby to be obtained. In conclusion, the Committee desire to state that, subject to a due allowance being made in time for the hiatus which has occurred during the negotiations for the transfer of the Dockyards to the Commonwealth, as well as for the time which has elapsed since the removal from the Committee's control in last January (from which date no responsibility for delay is taken) the Committee are willing to resume control at the establishment, and to deliver the warships ordered.

Members of the late Committee of Management. Cass, Secretary to the Committee. The late Government called for applications throughout the world for a general manager. They did not fix a salary, but asked the applicants to fix their own salary, the determination being to get the best man available, and to pay him well. The applications were gone through by a committee appointed in England, and consisting of Admiral Henderson, Captain Haworth Booth, and either the High Commissioner or Captain Collins. A recommendation of a person was made by the committee, and had not the Government been practically under sentence of death, that appointment would have been made. The present Government have been in office for nearly two months. They know that there can be no satisfactory carrying on of work until the question of Cockatoo Island Dock is settled by the appointment of a general manager - by haying somebody in authority to refer to. The honorable senator who sprang this scare upon the public has had for two months the opportunity of making an appointment. He has had the names before him; he has had the authority of the Government, with a majority behind it, of making an appointment, but he has not done so. The responsibility for any delay which has arisen from the non-appointment of a general manager he must accept himself. I invite him to say why he has not appointed that gentleman, because I know that it was most unsatisfactory to have to carry on with an acting manager. I intend no reflection upon the gentleman who was the servant of New South Wales. He had no permanent appointment with the Commonwealth, and, therefore, he could not be expected to take upon himself the responsibility, nor would the Naval Board like to remodel the dockyard, or make any drastic alterations there until a general manager was appointed. Senator Millen knows, if he has read the papers, that many things which the Naval Board had advised had to be deferred until a general manager was appointed. If he had wished to expedite that work, one of the methods by which he could have done so was to come to a decision to appoint one of the applicants as a general manager, or to say to the acting manager,' We have decided not to appoint any of these applicants. We will give you authority to act.'","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/continue[35]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

If the Minister can produce any evidence to the contrary, I shall be obliged if he will bring it forward. Seeing that he has quoted one member of the Naval Board in that connexion, I would like him to say whether the Naval Board have told him that they were in any way hampered by me, as Minister, in obtaining anything they required for the dockyard. I come to another sensation of the honorable senator, and that is his action in practically closing down the works at the Henderson Naval Base, in Cockburn Sound. In order to get at the genesis of this thing, let us see what Admiral Henderson says in his report of 1911. On page 12 he says - Port Western is a very good harbor, and until Cockburn Sound (Fremantle), which is far more important from a strategical point of view, is ready, this port should be utilized by the Western Division as one of its principal anchorages, and as a place where ships should be able to replenish with coal or oil fuel. We have to remember that he recommended two fleet primary bases for Australia, namely, at Sydney and Fremantle . On page 55 he sets out what are the general requirements of a fleet primary base - Docks capable of receiving the largest vessels when in an injured condition. Work-shops capable of effecting any repairs to, or replacements required in, hull machinery, fittings, or armament of all types of vessel; to include facilities for lifting out and replacing the heaviest weights, such as guns, gun-mountings, and machinery. Provision of the necessary equipment and supplies for replenishment of all naval ordnance, naval stores (including coal and oil) and provisions. Easy and safe communication with the manufactories of ship-building material, ordnance, and ammunition. Facilities for the rapid coaling of ships. Necessary equipment for testing chain cables. Safe storage for reserves of ammunition and explosives. Moorings and wharfage for ships under repair or in reserve, Satisfactory arrangements for reception and treatment of the sick and wounded. Then, dealing with the question of requirements, on page 56, he says - The harbor of Cockburn Sound, including Owen's Anchorage and Jervoise Bay, to be examined thoroughly as soon as possible by experts, with a view to locating the site of the future Naval Dockyard. The site should include space for graving docks, building slips, workshops, storehouses, and all plant, &c., for the building of ships and for the repairs and maintenance of a fleet. It appeared to me that a site in the vicinity of Jervoise Bay was best suited for Naval Dockyard requirements. A channel for deep-draught ships would have to be dredged through the Parmelia and Success Banks, and slight dredging would be required in other places. It would probably also be necessary that a short breakwater should be thrown out from Woodman's Point. I understand that plans and estimates have been framed for carrying out of a great part of this dredging, and I am sure that it will prove of the greatest Benefit not only to the Navy but also to merchant shipping and commercial interests, as it would greatly relieve the pressure on Fremantle Harbor for shipping accommodation which the future must inevitably bring. In the interim, the needs of the fleet will be met by - 1st. The completion of the dock now building at Fremantle and of the repair and refitting shops proposed to be attached thereto at as early a date as possible. 2nd. The temporary provision of a base for six destroyers and three submarines in the Swan River. 3rd. The dredging of the channel, so that large vessels can find a safe anchorage in Cockburn Sound. 4th. The provision of adequate reserves of coal and oil fuel, &c. A large area of land should be reserved for Naval purposes, so as to allow of considerable future expansion. A site to be selected for storage of ammunition and explosives. When Admiral Henderson made this report, he had with him an exceedingly competent staff. He had also all the data relating to the various soundings which had been taken over a period of years, all the information which had been gained about the harbor and its approaches, and about these banks. He had the Admiralty charts of over fifty years ago; he was able to compare the existing depth of water with that shown on those charts, and with the more modern soundings taken during recent years in the course of the exploratory surveys for the main harbor at Fremantle, which was eventually located in the Swan River, but which it was at one time proposed to establish at Owen's Anchorage, Woodman's Point, the spot where Sir John Coode recommended that it should be established. In connexion with that inquiry, the then enginer-in-chief, Mr. O'Connor, had occasion not merely to refer to the depths shown on the Admiralty charts, but to check them with the depths which now obtained, and which had been brought about by the scouring action of the tides. Admiral Henderson had all that information placed in his hands by the West Australian Government at the request of the Commonwealth Government. I invite attention to the fact that that officer recommended both an interim programme and an ultimate programme. His ultimate programme was a fleet base, which should be the centre of the fleet when created. His interim programme was a base for the vessels which are to comprise the fleet unit. In recommending that interim programme, as he does in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4. of his report, he took into consideration the fact that there was then being built in Fremantle a dockyard which, at the request of the Federal Government, had been made large enough to accommodate the flagship Australia. Senator Millen, or his advisers, must have lost sight of the fact that that dockyard is a thing of the past.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/continue[38]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Would he not have submitted a very different report if he had known that we would not have such a dock? Is it not likely that he would have recommended the construction of a floating dock for Cockburn Sound in order that we might push on with necessary works there? It was because of the failure of the dock at Fremantle that the plans in regard to Cockburn Sound were put ahead of what Admiral Henderson proposed. If the graving dock had been constructed, all that would have been necessary in the interim programme would have been to proceed with the works that ore set out in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Admiral Henderson's report. But we had to recognise that we were bringing to Australia a battle cruiser which could be accommodated only in one dock in the Commonwealth, so that if she chanced to become crippled in the Indian Ocean she would have been obliged to go all the way round to Sydney to effect repairs. That consideration entirely altered the order in which certain works at Cockburn Sound required to be carried out, and indicated that, in addition to the undertakings recommended by Admiral Henderson in his interim programme, a floating dock would have to be provided.

It is necessary for the undertakings which will follow the survey work. Railway extension, preliminary works and plant, I find, were to cost £12,000. This expenditure included a house for the naval engineer, a house for the general foreman, offices for the staff, sheds, workshops, eze. Upon the removal of the powder magazines, new jetties and new railway sidings, £20,000 was to be expended. The diversion of the roadway was to cost £3,000, and wages for the staff £1,000, making a total of £45,000. In the £100,000 which appeared in the Estimates for 1912-13, provision was made for the purchase of a dredger for Cockburn Sound. The work which has been carried out with the aid of that expenditure has been exactly the work set out in the details which 1 have given. But as that work proceeded, and as the requisite data was acquired, we were able to decide upon the other works which could be undertaken only after the completion of the survey. The Minister of Defence has sufficient information in the Navy Office to-day to authorize the Government in submitting a proposition on the next Estimates in favour of starting those works. The reason why I sanctioned the railway proposal was that it was demonstrated to me by the members of the Naval Board that that railway was necessary, not merely to provide access for the men who would be employed on the works, but also to convey the necessary material for the works, which they urged should be proceeded with at once. Now, as to the site for the dockyard. Cockburn Sound is a huge harbor, somewhere about 12 miles from north to south. In that large sheet of water there are three possible sites for a dockyard. One is at Rockingham Bay, on the extreme southerly side of the Sound and the farthest from the main entrance and Fremantle, another is at Case Point, half-way between Rockingham Bay and the northern portion of the Sound, and the third is at Jervoise Bay, Woodman's Point, which was the site recommended by Admiral Henderson. When Admiral Henderson recommended that site, he had before him information from the Western Australian Government as to the depth of water it contained, and the Minister of Defence must know that there is from 40 to 46 feet available in close proximity to Jervoise Bay.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/continue[43]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I come now to the question of how Jervoise Bay came to be finally selected. The Navy Office is a thing of comparatively recent growth. Three years ago there were only one man and a boy employed there. But after the adoption by the late Government of Admiral Henderson's scheme, steps were taken to constitute .a Naval Board, and that Board was called upon by me, as Minister of Defence, to organize a staff for carrying out their work. As they brought to me their proposals in that connexion, applications were invited for the positions, and from those applications the Naval Board recommended the appointment of the experts who should have charge of the various departments. In every instance in which experts have been appointed they have been appointed on the recommendation of the Naval Board. One of those experts is the Director of Naval Works, whose duty it is, under the third member of the Board, to work out the plans for works when once the policy to be followed has been determined. That policy in the present instance was the establishment of a fleet base at Cockburn Sound. Surveyors were put to work there. They reported, as the result of boring in the sand, that a certain depth of water was available, and from time to time various recommendations were made by the Director of Naval Works to the third member of the Naval Board. Every step taken by the late Government was taken on the recommendation either of a member of the Naval Board or of that Board as a whole. Never at any time during my period of office as Minister of Defence did the Naval Board, either individually or collectively, express to me any want of confidence in the staff as a whole or any individual member of it. Never once did they tell me that they were not satisfied that the authority upon which they were acting was insufficient or inefficient. Therefore, as these gentlemen came forward with their recommendation, I contend that I was justified in assuming that they were satisfied that the experts under them who were supplying them with expert advice were skilled in their particular work.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/continue[44]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

When he returned he said, ' We have taken the first four.' I said, ' With what result?' The reply was, ** We could only find a card for one, but the others are dummy cards.' I said, ' What do you mean by dummy cards?' and I discovered that where the officials found the name of some person on an old roll, and could not find the person himself to sign a card, they obligingly dropped a card into the index, and signed it for him.

I said that that system was broken by Ministerial authority, and 80,000 names were improperly inserted in the rolls for one State alone.

In the circumstances, putting two and two together, one could only arrive at the conclusion that to secure a clean election was not the highest ambition of the late Government. Senator Findley apparently objects to such a statement, but I wonder what sort of language he would himself have used if the Government on this side were guilty of such a breach of faith with Parliament as is represented by the violation of the card system which I have described. I pass from that to the remarks made by Senator Pearce with respect to Mr. Knibbs' statistics. The honorable senator sought to discount them by referring to them as rough estimates or rough statistics.

We have no right, therefore, to discount the figures referred to. No one contends that they are absolutely accurate, but they are the official figures adopted for the purposes I have mentioned, and they may be taken as a guide to determine whether the rolls contain an undue percentage of the people. No one who has anything to do with the Electoral Office will venture to deny that these figures may be so used, and that they show that the rolls were inflated, although Senator Pearce, in the last Parliament, made the denial on more than one occasion. It is clear that prior to the elections the rolls were grossly inflated, and they still are in that condition. There is one other matter connected with this question to which I may refer.

He said that in order to insure that the Commission would be received with respect, and that its report would carry weight, it should be composed of men of that standard.

It is not in regard to the policy which we are pledged to carry out that we differ, but in the fact that I believe more businesslike methods require to be followed than I was able to trace in the Defence Department upon my accession to office. I believe that the greatest enemy to the defence system of Australia will be extravagance and folly. The people scarcely realize how much our defence scheme is going to cost them. When they do realize it, if they find that their money is being squandered, I venture to say there will be a reaction in the public mind which will inflict a more serious injury on our defence policy than could be inflicted by hundreds of condemnatory speeches from the public platform.

Before I give the result of his examination may I say this: Senator Pearce has told us that the late Government were aware that the plant at Cockatoo Island was not up to date, that things were not quite as they ought to be, and that knowing so much, they took over the dock as a defective concern. Will Senator Pearce deny that the recommendation upon which the late Government acted when they decided to take over Cockatoo Island was a recommendation in which these terms were used? I am speaking from memory, but I am correct as to the essence of the statement - that because things at Cockatoo Island were so hopelessly unsatisfactory the only possible remedy was for the Commonwealth Government to take it over if they wanted their ships to be built. That was the recommendation made to the late Government - not that they should take over Cockatoo Island as a going concern, but that they should take it over because things were absolutely breaking down, and there was no possibility of getting their work done unless they did take it over.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[7]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

To-day we have had a letter read here from the gentlemen who were managing the dock, and whose management was so severely condemned when it was taken over; and these gentlemen who have been found guilty now come forward and testify that things were all right. Senator Pearce has told us more than once that he acted on the recommendation of the Naval Board - a Board which is charged with weighty and serious responsibilities. I do not propose to analyze the particular share of responsibility which attaches to the Minister and the Board.

When I went to the Department I found that there was in course of progress an inspection of the power plant at the Fitzroy Dock. When the report was presented I found in it a clear indication that the power plant was entirely defective. I very much doubt whether Senator Pearce knew that the plant was so defective as it was shown to be. I am not saying that as indicating any. want of supervision on his part. It would be foolish to suppose that a Minister can keep his eyes on everything. I am inclined to think that the late Government would not have been inclined to take over the dock on such terms if they had known that the condition of the plant was as serious as it was shown to be. At all events, they would have taken some steps before they continued to work the power plant. In due course the gentleman appointed by Senator Pearce to make recommendations furnished his report.

Here are the statements to which I refer, and to which the acting manager was invited to supply an answer. The Naval Board, having received the report of the Board of Survey on the boilers under your charge at Cockatoo Island, is of opinion that obvious and necessary precautions which common experience has shown to be absolutely necessary to the safe working of steam boilers, would appear to have been neglected. The Board of Survey found thick deposits of slime on the tubes, stays, and plates, and in the case of the locomotive type boilers Nos. t to 4 the lower tubes were buried in sludge.

He writes - Sir, In further reference to the interview which you and your Board were kind enough to grant to' me yesterday, having had time to more fully consider the substance of your proposals, I thought it would be more satisfactory to yourself and your Board if I placed before you in writing my decisions concerning same.

The honorable senator shakes his head, but I ask him to listen to an extract from a report by Sir John Coode in 1887 - The borings through the Success and Parmelia banks have shown, as before stated, that they consisted almost entirely of sand. Any channel which might be formed through these shoals would inevitably necessitate frequent dredging for maintenance, and, as I pointed out in my report of 1877, such an approach would be impracticable and dangerous in a gale from the west, when the wind would be directly across the line of channel, and it would be impossible to_ confine vessels to the deep-water track. Notwithstanding the fine sheet of water which exists in Cockburn Sound, the difficulties attendant upon the formation and maintenance of suitable and safe approaches are so great, and would be accompanied with such a large expenditure, both in first cost and maintenance, and there will be no alternative but to consider the utilization of the shelter and deep water there as entirely unattainable.

These are not easy works to carry out. They are not works which you can find many people competent to execute.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[8]/continue[46]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Believing, therefore, that it was the ng ut thing to do, I had no hesitation in asking that a communication should be sent to the High Commissioner, asking him to take steps to obtain applications from engineers of experience. I have endeavoured to make a plain statement with regard to the matters that have been mentioned. I have inadvertently omitted to deal with my point. I shall be glad to have my attention directed to it, in order that I may repair the omission afterwards. I have endeavoured to approach the subjects with which I have dealt, not merely as one who thoroughly and sincerely believes in the defence policy, which we are pledged to carry out, but in the belief that that policy will lose in public estimation unless, in trying to give effect to it, we are careful of the interests of those who have to find the money. While I should be the last in the world to impair the efficiency of either the Naval or the Military Forces by any unnecessary scamping or economy, I still maintain that it is possible to carry out the defence scheme with the same careful regard for the taxpayers' money as we show in regard to any other Department of the Commonwealth.
