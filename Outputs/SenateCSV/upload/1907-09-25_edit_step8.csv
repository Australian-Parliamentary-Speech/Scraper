I wish briefly to remind the Government of their declaration of a whole-hearted belief in the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, and their strenuous affirmation that so far as they could they would see that both the letter and the spirit of. the measure, if enacted, were adhered to. It will be recollected that both at the general election and since then the Government have re-affirmed their belief in the principles of that law, and have taken no little credit to themselves for having the temerity to grapple with one of the admittedly great problems which have to be faced today. I shall now refer briefly to the incidents connected with the alleged coal combination, and then submit to the Government suggestions for their consideration. Honorable senators probably have read in the press a report that a firm styled Scott Fell& Co. had applied to one of the colliery proprietors, who are included in the Coal Vend, for coal to be shipped to New Zealand in a steam-ship called the Ennerdale, and that the application was refused. The statement made by Mr. Scott Fell, and published in the Sydney press, was that he was refused coal, and that a member of the Coal Vend told him that Scott Fell & Co. were not in the Shipping Combine, and that for that reason a cargo of coal would not be supplied to him. That statement has been amplifier! by one or two others to which I shall refer. But, first of all, in order to make that point quite clear, I shall take the liberty of reading from the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 2 1 st September, an extract in which the Sydney agents for the vessel make a statement, and, of course, the persons named can be called upon to substantiate the remarks which apparently they volunteered to the press. The extract reads as follows: -","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Brown, of Wellington, to return coal laden. This firm has been a regular customer for Newcastle coal for some years. In the case of the Ennerdale , there was no question of short notice with respect to the coal cargo required. At least three months' notice was given of the intention to despatch the steamer. The cargo, however, was absolutely refused. The agents were told distinctly that as the vessel was outside the ' vend,' it was no use trying to get a cargo, and the Union Company, when asked to accept the charter, had plenty of bottoms of their own. 'We can, of course,' said the agents, ' get coal at any time from the vend, provided we ship it through the Union Steam-ship Company, or we can get it from some of the collieries that are outside the Combine; but it so happens that in the present instance, other coal would not suit the firm which gave the charter. They had certain contracts to fill, and required the coal, which they had been accustomed to. get. Arrangements have now been made to ship certain quantities through the Union Company.

In the Sydney Morning Herald of the same date appears an interview with Mr. Scott Fell, who makes the following statements -","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I would not be surprised if in the course of time these sailors will get the kick-out. Our firm has applied for coal over and over again, and we cannot get it. They want to know why we should expect coal. And for coasting requirements, they refer us to some of the steam-ship owners - members of the Com bine. These owners say they cannot supply us, or that they have sold out. Or they ask us a price or stipulate conditions which make it impossible for people to trade. 'You claim to be practically boycotted?' ' You have just struck it. Some of the proprietors are working in with the shipping ring to endeavour to drive us out.' ' The Inter-State Shipping Combine should now have a large amount of money invested in the collieries,' he went on. ' The- object is the controlling of the whole of the Australasian trade, and the prevention of any opposition while the people have to pay the piper.

In the Daily Telegraph of the 23rd the manager, Mr. Wheeler, of the Newcastle-Wallsend Colliery, which is outside the Vend, was interviewed. He was asked if he had any objection to state the reasons why the company remained outside of it, and said - ' We believe in freedom of contract. We object to being bound down to supply only certain vessels with coal.' If the statement that that company remains outside the Vend because it objects to being bound to supply only certain vessels with coal, means anything, it is a fair inference that those who are inside the Vend are so bound. I admit that it is not conclusive, but to my mind a very strong inference to be drawn from the statement is that one of the conditions of the Vend is that they are only to supply to certain people, and under certain conditions. I wish to make it quite clear that in reading these extracts I am not affirming anything other than the fact that these statements have been made publicly. It is not competent for me to vouch for the accuracy or inaccuracy of any one of them, but they appear in public print, as made by men with some standing in the commercial world, men who are get-at-able, and who can be called upon if necessary to substantiate or withdraw their remarks. The sole object of the action I am taking to-day is to bring them under notice, in order to point out to the Government that to my mind, at any rate - and I trust that I shall have the sympathy of the Senate in this matter - sufficient has been disclosed to show that there is a very serious obligation upon the Government to probe this matter to the bottom. If there has been no harm done, and no infringement of. the law, no one, not even the members of the Vend themselves, will have any cause of complaint, or be in any way injured. On ' the other hand, if there is something being done - it may be only in its initial stages - which is to the detriment of Australian trade, the sooner we discover the whole truth of the matter the sooner shall we be in a position, if the present law is not strong enough, to arm the Administration with a more effective legislative enactment. It is not at all necessary to remind honorable senators of the great importance which the coal trade is, and always must be, to Australia. It is one of our big lines of export, and we should watch very carefully that no firm or combination of firms shall? be allowed to take any action which may, perhaps not immediately, but in the future, tend to the serious diminution or restriction of the export of one of our staple lines of industry. I should like to summarise the statements which can reasonably be founded upon the newspaper extracts that I have read. They are, first of' all, that a Vend exists. Upon that I do not: think there can be the slightest possible doubt. The second is that this Vend works with, and in the interests of, a Shipping. Combine. The statements are clear that it will only allow certain trade to pass through certain shipping people. The third point is, that it will not sell coal unless it first ascertains the destination. The fourth is that it will not sell for coastal purposes or to New Zealand unless through the Shipping Combine, thus securing a monopoly of freight to that combination. These are all definite statements which, if borne out by further inquiry, to my mind bring the people responsible for this condition of affairs clearly within the four corners of that Act, or, to put it in another way, clearly within the four corners of what this Senate, when it was passing that Act, thought it to be.","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

We want some further inquiry than that; 'but whenever the Government have been pressed, in the matter they always .plead - and' I can understand and sympathize with the plea - the difficulties! of obtaining information. Naturally, if people are working in contravention of the law, we do not expect them to come forward and volunteer the information upon which they might be indicted.

The Coal Combine has done very great service up to the present moment Whether it has also done the injury that is indicated by the Scott Fell case I am not prepared to say. That matter is certainly worthy of every man's inquiry. I have seen the time when it was the prayer of every man working in' the mines that the employers would come together and deal honestly with one another in the selling of their coal, in order that they - the men who were producing it. - might obtain an honest livelihood. For years the practice was for one coal-owner to go to a ship and offer coal at 8s. a ton, and then for another to come along two hours afterwards and say, ' I will load you for 8s. too, and give you 500 tons for taking the load.' That condition of things existed in New South Wales for years to my knowledge. When the produce of a hard-working man is being trafficked with in this way, and he is not obtaining sufficient wages to keep body and soul together, it is the precursor of a happier condition of things when a combination takes place to raise the price of coal to a fair figure. From my life's experience, I will not say for a moment that the Newcastle Combine has raised the price of coal one penny higher than its fair value. My complaint has always been that the coal has been sold far below its market value, as can be easily proved by statistics from other parts of the world, and by a comparison of the quality of the different coals. I do not oppose a careful inquiry into anything that is wrong, but, up to the present moment, apart from the evidence given in the press of the one act complained of , I am with the Coal Combine, and will only exercise my best endeavours towards getting the highest distribution of wages possible to the men who are producing the coal.","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In their report they said, ' We recommend that the Government should take action to abolish the giving of rebates,' but on the other hand they also recommended that the Australian shipowners should have a right to the Austra- , lian coastal trade. They practically said to the ship-owners, ' On the one hand we will give you the right to the Australian coastal trade, but on the other we prohibit you from giving rebates.' The position in the past was that the very cheapest labour that could be found in the world was brought into competition with Australian seamen on the Australian coast. The manufacturer was protected right up to the hilt, but the shipping industry was left to paddle its own canoe, and, as Australia would not give them any protection, the Australian ship-owners, as business men, naturally decided that they must take means to protect their own trade, with the result that they agreed to give rebates to people who shipped by their vessels, and who refused to ship by the cheap lascar and Chinese manned steamers.

They included the Australian United Steamship Navigation Company, the Howard Smith Company, the Adelaide Steamship Company, the Melbourne Steamship Company, and Huddart, Parker and Company. One firm would advertise a boat to leave the Melbourne wharfs at 12 o'clock. Another would advertise a vessel to leave at 2, and a third would fix 4. The result was that those ships often went away with less than a third of a cargo. They had to be fully manned. The result was that in 1893-4, not a shipping company in Australia was paying a single shilling in dividends to its shareholders.

As for the capitalists, I do not think that coal mines in Australia have for many years paid sufficient dividends to make them more than a subject of keen interest to see whether it is possible to get any dividend from them. I support the request for a speedy inquiry into this matter with pleasure, but I agree with Senator Guthrie inthinking that, if an inquiry is to be made by a Commission or a Committee it is the duty of Parliament to do its own work. We should not eternally abrogate the functions of responsible Government by handing everything over to Commissions. In New South Wales government by Commission has been far too rampant for many a year, and State Ministers and members have, I am afraid, very largely lost the sense of responsibility that should attach to those intrusted with the duties of responsible government. If we are to make an inquiry, we should be able to do the work ourselves. It is absurd to suppose that we cannot have an honest and unprejudiced* inquiry by members of the Legislature.

I interjected that they would ' crush the public between them.' Senator Henderson, in my opinion, has justly and fairly explained that trusts are not in themselves necessarily an evil. Nay, I will go further and say, that if what is going on at present in regard to legislation affecting trade continues, it will be almost a necessity for combinations in some shape or form to be brought into existence to a greater extent than is now the case, or than has been the case in. the past. I emphatically protest against Senator Findley's assertion that combines are necessarily evils and are unjust to the public at large.","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It may be found that the Combine is conducting its business on legitimate lines and is acting equitably to the public. In that case there would be no need for further proceedings to be taken.

I say that not only because of the opinions expressed on this side of the Chamber, but also because of those enunciated by honorable senators opposite Honorable senators hold various opinions in reference to combines. Some contend that they are good up to a certain point, and that then they become social pests. Others may consider that they are not good at any time. I am not one of those who think that they are not: good at any time; but I do think that whenever they become social pests it is time not only for Parliament to talk about them, but for the Government to take steps to put in force the law that was passed for the protection of the public, which is generally known as the Anti-Trust Act. In the course of the debate I interjected ' What about the sma I man? ' and an honorable senator replied, 'The small man has to go.'' I venture to think that the small man has not to go to such an extent as some honorable senators think. I shall connect these remarks with the matter that has been brought under the notice of the Senate by Senator Millen. We know something about a Shipping Combine on the coast of Queensland. It may not be absolutely the same Combine, or on all fours, with that which operates in other parts of Australia, but it is based upon the same principle of action; and the matter to which I refer should be carefully inquired into. Not so very long ago - I think within the last two years - an attempt was 'made by the shipping trading companies along the Queensland coast, or on a certain part of the coast in the vicinity of Mackay, absolutely to debar their customers from employing the small cutters which they had been utilizing. This maybe said not to have anything to do with the Coal Combine, or the Coal Vend, as it is called, but I use the case to show how the perfectly legitimate trade of small men may be cut into by a combine.","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The least that the Government can do is to take every energetic step in their power to make investigations and obtain information, even going to the cruxial point of putting the Combine on their defence in 'the law Courts. The power is conferred by the Act, and I ask the Government why they do not use it. Why should we have to come forward and urge the Government to enforce the Act which they themselves asked Parliament to pass! The Government did not then say, ' If you pass an amendment we will drop the Bill, because that would make it useless.' On the contrary, they accepted such amendments as were carried, and the Bill became law. The least the Government can do now is to take every possible step to make full inquiry, and if they find that any combines are operating to the detriment of either traders or the general public to immediately intervene. It is more than ever necessary that this action should be taken in connexion with shipping, in view of the fact that before long we shall be asked to extend a monopoly to a certain class of ship-owners.","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I presume that in other cases, where it was thought that the law could be invoked, the Government have found a difficulty in getting men to substantiate their statements. Senator Symon stated that under one section of the Australian 'Industries Preservation Act 'the Court has power to compel men to divulge information, and in reply to my interjection, he added that the section applied to -witnesses for the prosecution. It is an extraordinary thing to me if the Act contains that power. If witnesses for a prosecution can be compelled to come forward and give evidence, we are breaking fresh ground in legal procedure. In reference to the Coal Combine, I can fully appreciate the remarks of Senator Henderson, although they may have surprised certain honorable senators. I can quite realize that in Australia there has been such a thing ais suicidal ' competition amongst companies engaged in carrying on industries. Np doubt that competition has been carried on to the absolute detriment of the people engaged in the industries, especially to the workers. -I can remember the competition which prevailed in the maritime carrying trade fifteen years ago. The shipping companies were running against each other in every direction, contending in an unfair and unwarrantable way for a small trade. Ultimately they were forced to reduce wages-. Our standing counsel to them was to wipe out the suicidal competition. They could not do that unless they combined. ^1 can understand circumstances arising which would warrant the formation of a combination of coal-owners for the purpose of putting an end to suicidal competition. That brings me to the point that if combination amongst the workers is necessary and justifiable, it is equally necessary and justifiable so far as the employers are concerned. In season and out of season it was pointed out that in the maritime carrying trade it was owing to suicidal competition that the steam-ship companies were unable to pay a decent living wage. We urged them to combine, and they were very tardy in taking our advice. I do not care if certain persons wonder at my remarks. I can see as great a necessity for combination amongst employer's as amongst employes. That brings me to a point mentioned by Senator Findley, and that is that it is only through combines that evil can exist. Take our experience in Melbourne in connexion with the production of coal and its use. We find that the evil steps in immediately the Combine has finished its contact with the product. Although coal can be delivered on' the Melbourne wharf at 15s. per ton, yet it costs ' 28s. or 30s. a ton to the consumer in a suburb. The price of the product is doubled for the mere purpose of conveying it from the ship's side to the 'consumer's premises.","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

You pointed out at that time that the Bill was not in demand by anybody, and that all the Chambers of Commerce in Australia, who, I. take it, represented pretty well the commercial opinion of Austrafia, were absolutely opposed to the measure, lock, stock, and barrel, as introduced. Therefore, what I am saying does not refer only to one particular aspect of it. I myself am not opposed to combination. I think it is absolutely necessary. But when a number of men like the coal owners, who control a natural product, get into such a position that they are able to say, either to those whom they employ. ' You will have to work for so-and-so,' or to the public ' You will have to pay so much for this commodity,' it is the greatest possible argument that can be advanced to forward the platform of the party with which I am associated. There can be no stronger argument for what we advocate than to say ' These people are a menace, not only to the commerce of the community, but also to the interests of the community as a whole.' We have an object lesson in this matter in what has taken place in New Zealand. A few years ago the coal magnates there were in exactly the same position as the coal owners in New South Wales are in to-day. They . were able to combine to regulate the output, to say to the public, 'You shall pay a certain price for your coal,' and to say to the miners whom they employed ' ' Your wages shall be so much, ' ' thereby victimising on the one side the men whom they employed, and on the other the consumer. The only means by which it was found possible to deal with those people was for the Government of New Zealand to step in and open up coal mines of their own.

The same condition as obtained in New South Wales also obtained to a very great extent in Queensland. Men at' the Bundamba collieries were living a life, in many cases, which was not fit for a decent man to live, because the price at which the coal was being sold was so low that there was always friction between the men and the mine-owners regarding the wages. For the last four months we have had men out on the Queensland coast for the very same reason, the coal-owners contending that they are not able to pay more, and the miners saying that they aTe not able to obtain a decent living at the rates at which, they were paid. I am in sympathy with the object which Senator Millen seeks to attain, but, at the same time, like Senator Henderson and a number of other honorable senators belonging to the party which sits on this side, I had no particular faith in the Australian Industries Preservation Act when it was passed. I shall have no particular faith in it even if the honorable senator succeeds in making it as strong again as it is, but what has been stated by honorable senators opposite is the strongest argument in favour of the control of the trade by an authority which will see that a fair thing is done to the consumer, and also to those who are employed in obtaining the commodity. The party which will bring that about, so far as I understand it, is the State, and the State only.","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Senator Henderson has referred to the beneficial action of the Combine in keeping up prices at what he says, and probably rightly, is only a fair rate to enable reasonable wages to be paid. I wish to remind him, as T have already done by interjection, that I in no sense question that aspect of the. doings of the Combine. I did not wish to raise it. I did not wish to complicate the question which I brought before the Senate. I simply dismiss it now with the remark that I am not affirming that the Vend itself is injurious. The only matter which I brought under the notice of the Senate was that the Vend was alleged to be doing something injurious. All the good acts of that combination will secure approval. If the allegations are right, it was one of their wrong-doings to which I directed ' attention. I ask the Senate to consider the two matters as quite distinct and separate. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in his reply to my opening remarks, practically told the Senate that the Government had, in similar cases, made many inquiries, and that the information obtainable was quite useless. But he promised the Senate, in all sincerity, that further inquiries would be made. If he believes that such inquiries are useless and ineffective, and lead us nowhere, there is not much satisfaction in his saying that the Government will again go through the performance. Inquiries such as the Department is in a position to ma'ke will always end, as those have ended, in nothing more than a repetition of a. very tame farce. What is the nature of them? The information which the Vice-President of the Executive Council read to me this afternoon has been largely obtained from interested parties, who are the only parties that appear on the surface. The tone and character of that reply showed that it was instigated by somebody connected with the industry which was nominally on its trial. That is not the sort of inquiry we want. I affirm the opinion, expressed by several honorable senators, that there is only one form of inquiry which will enable us to get at the truth of the matter, and that is' an inquiry before the common law courts of the country. If the Government find that they are unable to secure sufficient evidence to bring an action of that kind1, I repeat my suggestion that a Commission should be appointed to ascertain the facts of the case, and to discover wherein our law is defective. I need hardly remind the Vice-President of the Executive Council that for the purposes of such an inquiry a Royal Commission has a better chance of obtaining information than a court restricted by the laws qf evidence which do not apply to an inquiry by a Royal Commission. I hope that the appointment of a Commission will not be necessary, and I believe the law should be given a fair chance that its efficacy may be proved. But if it is found necessary to have an inquiry by a Royal Commission, I do repeat my very fervent hope that it will not be constituted of politicians. Nothing has served to bring the work of Royal Commissions into discredit more than the fact that there have been appointed to them men whose views have been known, and have been strongly expressed. It should not be necessary to say that in suggesting that the appointments to such a Commission should be confined to persons outside Parliament, I do not reflect in anyway on the honesty and capacity of members of Parliament. I take the Tariff Commission as an example in point. It was constituted of four gentlemen holding one fiscal view and four holding the opposite fiscal view. They were all equally honorable men, and perhaps of equal intelligence, and, after listening to evidence, they arrived at directly opposite conclusions.","Alleged Coal Combine","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I, therefore, listen to what he has to say with a good deal of interest, and I propose to quote from an article appearing in this journal to show why I think there is something to be said in favour of this bounty. The bounty proposed is id. per lb. for eight years, and the maximum amount to be payable in any one year is?1,500. Should the maximum be paid in each of the eight years, the total amount involved would be?12,000.

Is it because other crops pay better, or because they are deterred by the supposed scientific methods adopted in rearing the plants? No doubt every agriculturist will agree that the quicker a crop can be raised the sooner it can be put on the market, and the less handling required to put it in marketable condition the better it will pay. There are some crops which can be sold straight from the field, such as sugar cane, potatoes and root crops, lucerne, arid oaten hay, Sec. Others, again, require a certain amount of preparation before they can be sold. Grain crops, for instance, rubber, tea, coffee, cacao, or fibre plants, &c. Sugar cane has to be crushed, but the farmer has nothing to do with that. All he has to do is to grow the cane and cut it at maturity when it is a saleable commodity. Now, it is the same with coffee. When the berries are picked they can be taken to the State pulper at Kamerunga, and there they are reduced to a marketable article, when the farmer has nothing more to do with it except receiving the value of his crop when sold. As far as growing the coffee trees is concerned, there is no more difficulty about it than there is in growing orange or apple trees. Furthermore, wherever frost is absent coffee will thrive, given, of course, a reasonably good soil and rainfall. Some of the best coffee in Queensland is grown at the Buderim Mountain in the Maroochie district, and from one end of the State to the other the plant thrives luxuriantly on the warm coast lands.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[2]/quote[1]/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

At this rate, the dry parchment would cost under 24d per lb., and when milled - parchment and silver skin removed - the cost is brought up lo 3d. per lb. on the commercial coffee bean. Some planters, says Mr. Hepburn, plant I,000trees per acre, and he gives the average production at 2d. per parchment cured coffee pe.r tree. From this it is to be deduced that at /d. per lb., the price obtained by Mr. R. D. Lewis, Cairns, for his parchment coffee, each tree would? yield is. 2d., or at the rate of ^58 6s. Sd. per acre.

These figures are, of course, of old date, and we have not at hand any very late similar particulars from Mr. Newport. The latter puts the cost of picking, however, at id. per lb.

This 5 tons, off 10 acres, if sold at ^'50 Per ton (I am purposely quoting figures so low that even the most pessimistic cannot cavil at on the score of over-sanguiness), would give a gross income °f £25°- Deducting, say, £2 per week for the owner's living, a balance of about ^150 remains, out of which to pay for the two helping hands for a few months, transport of crop to town, and interest on or part repayment of the initial cost, spread over the first three or four years - surely a fair margin, lt will thus be seen that whilst coffee is practically an ' impossibility as an industry for a large capitalist with thousands of acres, it undoubtedly offers a very comfortable living for the working farmer, precise! v ft was, is, and will be to a still greater extent, in the case of small areas of cotton.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[2]/quote[2]/para[2]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Senator Henderson's objection to it is that, so far, coffee has only been cultivated in Australia in small areas. But we have been looking for industries capable of profitable application to small areas. This appears to be such an industry. Senator Henderson is also opposed to the item because, he said, cotton-growing is merely an amusement for those engaged in it. Surely the complaint of those interested in labour is in that, in many instances, the work of the labourer is painful, arduous, and disagreeable. If we can establish an industry that will give profitable employment to our people, and which is in itself interesting and almost delightful, that is an argument for establishing it. Again, Senator Henderson objected to the item on the ground that children are employed in coffee cultivation. He very properly objects to the exploitation of child labour. If the child labour used in coffee production were of an arduous, continuous, and painful kind, I certainly should protest against it. But there are some industries in connexion with which the family of a cultivator can be profitably, helpfully, and unobjectionably. employed. In most small orchards the orchardist avails himself of the services of his children for a few weeks in the yea.r. Their work is not at all disagreeable or injurious.

It is not used here so extensively as in some other countries, but still a considerable quantity is consumed.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The probability is that coffee has not been extensively cultivated, because many of our people have not thought of growing it. Their attention has been directed to other crops. One of the special advantages of bounties is that they direct public attention to the desirableness of cultivating the products for which the bounties are given. Very often it happens that an industry to which a bounty is given would have been successful if the bounty had not been paid. Indeed, I should say that an industry that would not succeed if some person applied capital to it without a bounty, would probably not succeed with a bounty. But the object of bounties is to tide over the difficulties attendant upon the initial stages of an industry. The more we direct public attention to industries which we seek to develop, the more likelihood there is of their being successful. I trust that the item will be agreed to, in order that coffee may be grown here on White Australia principles. Nearly all the coffee that we now consume is grown outside Australia by coloured labour. We object to coloured labour entering into competition with us internally; and we ought to object to its competition with an article which we can successfully grow within our borders. It may be proved that the bounty will not develop the growth of coffee to any large extent, and that we shall still have to import a considerable quantity.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

That interjection, I venture to think, really embraces the whole of the objections to this item. which come mainly from honorable senators from Western Australia. The ordinary coffee that is chiefly imported into Australia now under a duty of 3d. per lb. costs1s. 6d. per lb. That is not Mocha coffee, the best quality, which would probably cost about 2s. per lb. It is a coffee which any person who understands that commodity will admit to be, if anything, inferior to the coffee that is now being produced in Queensland. The Queensland coffee is now being sold in Australia at the rate of is. 31/2d. per lb. net, as against1s. 6d. per lb. for coffee from abroad.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","288","CHATAWAY, Thomas","K6L","N/A","N/A","N/A","3709","Yes. The business of roasting coffee is practically an expert one. At present the coffee growers, operating on a comparatively small scale, roast their coffee on their own plantations. At all events, a large number of them do. The coffee is roasted on a comparatively small scale, with the result that we get various qualities. I believe that if the coffee which is grown in Queensland and elsewhere, and sold in the bean green, after it has been hulled, were sent to Melbourne and roasted on a large scale, the green coffee would realize about1s. 11/2d. per lb. to the grower. The cost of roasting is estimated at1d. per lb. when it is done on a reasonably large scale. If Australian coffee can be sold in a populous centre at not more than1s. 3d. per lb., it will compete on level terms with imported coffee. The industry only requires the assistance of a bounty to be able to compete with the imported article. If the method I suggested for carrying on the industry be adopted, as I believe it will be, then in every large centre factories will be established where coffee will be roasted, ground, tinned, and labelled. In that way a large quantity of work will be given to men or women, as the case may be, in every large centre as an absolute corollary to the establishment of the coffee industry in other parts of Australia. That will be additional to the benefit which will be derived from carrying out our policy of settling white people in the tropics. That is a point which honorable senators should bear in mind. I hope that in voting on the item they will not be carried away with the idea that it will be the means of suddenly raising the price of coffee to the poor man. There is every reason to' suppose that Australian-grown coffee will be able to compete with imported coffee on the terms I have mentioned.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The honorable senator admitted that despite the high protection afforded to the industry during past years it has not thriven. He further ' admitted that he doubted whether, even if this bounty were granted it would be sufficient to cause the industry to thrive. Senator Findley has supported the item in a very able speech, in which he has accused honorable senators who are opposed to it of acting contrary to their fiscal opinions. It is not the business of the Committee just now to discuss the fiscal issue; but let me say, as one who is opposed to the item, that I do not give way, even to Senator Findley, in my desire to encourage and foster the development of Australian industries. When I spoke on the item on Friday afternoon, Senator Findley interjected that what I said showed that if the outside world could supply Australia with iron there was no reason why we should give a bounty to the iron industry; but I point out that the coffee industry in Australia has received ample protection in the past, and yet has failed to thrive. I find from the Customs returns that in' 1906 we imported 1,677,853 lbs. of raw and kiln-dried coffee the duty on which was 3d', per lb. The people of the Commonwealth consequently paid during that year £20,973 on the importations of raw coffee. On roasted or ground coffee and coffee in a liquid form, the importation was 342,999 lbs., and the duty received at the rate of sd. per lb. amounted to £7,146. So that on the total, importation of coffee during 1.906, a sum amounting to £28,119 was paid by the people of the Commonwealth in order to protect and foster this industry. If the payment of such a sum in one year has not been sufficient to encourage a further development of 'the industry, I should like Senator Chataway or Senator Findley to tell me whether a bounty of £1,500 a year is likely to save the industry from ruin. Will this bounty represent the difference between success and failure in this industry? I say that it will not. Senator Henderson has referred to reasons for the decline in the coffee growing industry since the inauguration of Federation. The industry has received ample protection under the Tariff prior to and since Federation. I suggest as another factor in the decline of the coffee industry that when the duty imposed by the Queensland Tariff was reduced by id. per lb. under the Federal Tariff, tea was at the same time placed on the free list, and, consequently, since that time more tea and less coffee has been drunk in Australia.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

If it protected 'we would not be importing annually 2,000,000 lbs. of coffee, raw and liquid. If coffee were an article like tea, which could not be grown in Australia, commercially speaking, I would not be at all surprised. But it has been proved that coffee of the best quality can be grown here. I am not sure that it is not superior to Arabian coffee. In Queensland the industry was flourishing until Federation was accomplished, and the duty was reduced from 4d. to 3d. per lb. There maybe something in Senator Turley's claim that a number of persons deserted coffee growing for sugar-growing when the sugar boom was on. Federation gave a much wider market than previously existed, and the consequence was that men rushed into the sugar industry until now we are producing almost enough for our own requirements, and will speedily, unless something happens, be placing that commodity on the world's market and competing with the cheap coloured labour of other sugar countries. In face of that fact is it not desirable that the Commonwealth should) do something to establish a new industry? Here are we importing annually 2,000,000 lbs. of coffee value.d at £64,000, and yielding a duty of £28,000, so that in all our coffee costs us £92,000. I claim that it would be much better to grant a bounty of 6d. or 7d., or even 8d., per lb. upon the production of coffee than to continue to import it in such large quantities. Every one who votes against the bounty for coffee must, if he wishes to be consistent by-and-by, vote for the abolition of the Customs duty of 3d. per lb. on coffee. Why?

We spend only £64.000 on the 2,000,000 lbs. of coffee that we import, but, small as that quantity is, if we were producing it here, the expenditure of that amount of money within our own boundaries would give employment to quite a number of families. Coffee growing is eminently a family industry. It can be more advantageously carried on by a man with a young family, than by any other kind of settler. Those are the very people we want to encourage in the northern parts of the continent. We hear a great deal about the empty north, and about the need to populate it, but when the Government, in good faith, bring in a proposal which, if carried, will encourage the settlement of men with families there, a number of so-called protectionists - they must be a new brand of protectionists - bitterly oppose the idea.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[9]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

He got me some green coffee beans from Cairns, and some roasted coffee beans from the same place. According to his statement, this coffee was worth1s. 2d. per lb. It would appear from the prices which have been quoted, that that is a sufficiently high price to pay for coffee on the plantations, but it is much below the price at which other coffee could be bought here. I can assure honorable senators that the coffee made from the beans supplied to me by Senator Givens was good coffee, and was the genuine article. I can tell the Committee why coffee is not so largely used as it ought to be. When Senator Chataway was1 speaking, I interjected something about boots and crusts. It is a well-known fact - and I heard the statement made from the platform of the Adelaide Town Hall by a gentleman in the business - that coffee is very often adulterated with sawdust. I know that at the present time a very large proportion of the coffee that is consumed by the people of Australia is. more than 50 per cent. chicory.

There are many other things produced in Australia to the production of which the same argument has been applied. When we began to grow wheat in South Australia it was confidently declared by interested parties that the wheat industry could never be profitably carried on in that State Senator Russell must be aware of that fact.. The same argument applies to the production of sugar. If we should not grow coffee because it can be grown in abundance in. Brazil, we should not grow sugar, because in Java and portions of China, and in Jamaica, all the sugar necessary for the world's consumption could be grown. We can grow anything if we care to pay for it, and I say that since we commenced to grow sugar in Australia the consumers of the article have not been called upon to pay an appreciably increased price for it. It is the same with coffee. If we give sufficient encouragement to the industry by means of a protective duty, a bounty, and the effective administration of our Foods and Drugs Acts and the Commerce Act, we shall find in a very short time that we will be able to get genuine coffee grown in Australia, that will be beneficial to the consumers and profitable to those engaged in producing it. If we desire to populate this country and make it worth living in, we shall not ask ourselves what articles can be produced in other parts of the world where cheap labour can be obtained. The people of Great Britain could manufacture a sufficient number of boots to pave the whole world, but that is no reason why we should not establish the boot industry in Australia. The same thing applies to the manufacture of iron, steel, woollens, and everything else. There are other parts of the world, the inhabitants of which could supply the world's consumption of these commodities; but it is to our advantage tp establish these industries in Australia, open up avenues of employment, and secure the settlement of the country. It is better that we should do that than that we should be always considering what can be done profitably or unprofitable in other parts of the globe.

In some other countries, the consumption is very much greater.

That is not the desire of Senator Chataway. He is quite content that the bounty shall be payable when the coffee is in the parchment stage, in order that the grower may get the benefit of it. It is quite obvious, however, that if the amendment is made the Government can prescribe that' the bounty shall .be paid on the coffee when it is in the cherry stage. Does the Committee want that to be done? I do not believe that those who voted for the bounty in the division just taken intend that it shall be paid upon the coffee when it is in that initial stage, but we leave it optional with the Government to prescribe that if they like. I make that suggestion, and it is for .the Ministry and those who are supporting the bounty, to act on it. The Ministry naturally have ample confidence in themselves, because that is a very necessary preliminary to inviting other people to have confidence in them. But such a thing as the downfall of a Ministry has occurred, and another Ministry might take their place. I protest, in the interests of good sound legislation, against' leaving to be prescribed by Ministers those things which ought to be set out by Parliament. Senator KEATING (Tasmania- Min Chataway has said, after the coffee cherry has been grown, it has to pass through certain processes before what may be called the 'ordinary coffee of commerce is obtained. It is desirable that the bounty shall be paid only in respect of the actual coffee produced, and at such a time in the process of manufacture, under such conditions, and in such circumstances, that it must necessarily go to the grower and not to any subsequent manipulator. It will probably be necessary to make half-a-dozen regulations to insure that result. I take it that that is the object of Senator Chataway's proposal to insert the words ' as prescribed.' He has probably been motived by the item, 'Fish, Preserved as prescribed,' which appears lower in the schedule, where somewhat analagous conditions would prevail, because, when the fish has been caught, various operations have to be gone through before it is preserved, and it is desirable that there should be regulations as to the particular stage and circumstances at and under which the bounty shall be paid. No doubt that would be left to the Government in the first instance to prescribe, by providing regulations, but I need only remind honorable, senators that whenever any Act of Parliament provides that anything may be prescribed, the regulations must be tabled in Parliament within a certain time after they have been made,' if Parliament is sitting, and, if Parliament is not then sitting, then within a limited period after Parliament next assembles. It is perfectly competent for either House to veto all or any of the regulations. We had an experience of that in the Senate a few weeks ago, when a Public Service regulation was amended on the motion of Senator Findley. The Public Service Commissioner has since brought down a regulation amended in accordance with the wishes of the Senate. Even if Parliament were sitting, and exception was not taken in time to the regulations after they were tabled, it would be quite possible for the Minister, on his own initiative, or on representations to which he considered that proper weight should be attached from those conversant with the industry, to amend them.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It is of plug tobacco that there is a great consumption, and surely that is the article of which we ought to encourage the growth. If we are going to encourage the industry by means of a bounty, surely we should select that article in the production of which our people have the greatest chance of success. If they cannot succeed in growing leaf suitable for plug tobacco, they have no earthly chance of growing leaf suitable for cigar making.

I have watched the business very closely for some time past, and I may say that 8d. per lb. is not the average price paid for Australian leaf, but the price paid for the highest grade of Australian leaf. Therefore to limit the bounty to leaf bringing10d. per lb. would mean that we should pay no bounty at all. Mr. Temple Smith and Mr. Neville, who are tobacco experts, the one in his evidence before the Tobacco Commission, and the other in evidence given before the Tariff Commission, directed their remarks principally, and in the case of Mr. Temple Smith almost wholly, to the question of encouraging the growth of leaf for plug tobacco. They both drew attention to the necessity for the adoption of proper methods in the curing of the leaf. I take it that the payment of this bounty is intended to encourage not so much the growth of tobacco leaf as the adoption of proper methods of curing the leaf grown. It seems to be comparatively easy to grow tobacco, but very often when a good leaf has been grown it is spoiled as the result of ignorance of the proper method of curing it.

It seemed to me that the. object aimed at in offering this bounty is to promote the cultivation of tobacco leaf superior in quality to that which is being grown to-day. Senator Pearce will remember that he has himself informed the Senate on various occasions that there is a considerable quantity of leaf grown in Australia, which is practically a drug on the market, since it is a low-grade tobacco. We do not desire to offer a bounty to stimulate the production of an article w hich.it is already difficult to sell. We should therefore offer a bounty, if at all, for a more highly-priced article. By adopting the suggestion I made, and making the bounty payable only in respect of the higher grade leaf for plug tobacco, we shall stimulate the production of that particular quality of leaf which will pay the growers best, and which we should all desire to see cultivated in Australia. There is a very serious objection to making the bounty payable in proportion to the price obtained for the commodity. I point out that leaf which this year might be worth10d. per lb. might only bring 8d. per lb. next year. Quite apart from the difficulty to which Senator Pearce has referred as to the limited number of buyers, it is possible that if we had a dozen buyers the fluctuation of the market outside of Australia would necessarily affect prices here, and a man who had grown tobacco this year in anticipation of the bounty might fail to get it because of some slump in the world's market. He might have honestly earned the bounty, and through some cause over which he would have no control he would not be entitled to receive it. For this reason I think it would be better to pass the item as Senator Pearce now proposes, making the bounty payable for a high-grade tobacco leaf, but irrespective of the price which the commodity would bring. Whilst I propose to support the amendment, I need hardly inform honorable senators that I shall vote against the item as amended should the amendment be accepted.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The land has to be cultivated for a number of years before it produces a high class of tobacco. For these reasons., we ought to confine the bounty to the very highest class of cigar leaf. Other tobaccos can be grown under present conditions with the protection afforded by the Tariff. The increased duties on imported leaf stemmed and unstemmed and cut into strips will be quite sufficient to encourage the. growth of tobacco for the manufacture of plug and twist.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","518","TURLEY, Henry","K8W","N/A","N/A","N/A","3730","I know that the proportion is small. The aim of the experts has been to induce persons to engage in the industry with the object of growing a tobacco leaf of high value, which will be suitable for the making of cigars. They have also been teaching people, as far as possible, the best methods of curing the tobacco leaf when grown. Lately I came down from Sydney with the Queensland expert, from whom I learned that last year there had been paid to a man at Bower* 1s. per lb. for tobacco leaf which he had grown, and which was really cigar leaf. I know that for some years past attempts have been made to induce persons at Cardwell, Bowen, and the southern part of the State, to go in for growing high-grade tobacco leaf. I was given to understand by the expert that a considerable amount of success has been attained, and that not only in Coomera, but also in Bowen, persons are prepared to engage in the industry with the object of producing a tobacco leaf which can be used in making the wrappers of cigars. I think that the Committee will be acting rightly in rejecting the amendment of Senator Pearce, because what is sought to be attained is to induce persons to grow tobacco which will take the place, to a very large extent, of the tobacco which is mentioned in the report. The experts say that the importations into the Commonwealth are already very heavy. They give the figures for the manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco, and state that as regards cigars £108,000 worth - cigars and cigar leaf, I take it - was imported. These must be tobaccos of fairly high grade. If we can induce persons to engage in the industry with the knowledge that they will get some assistance from the State in addition to the education which is being imparted, we shall be proceeding in the right direction if the payment of the bounty is limited, as I think Senator Chataway pointed out, to tobacco leaf of high grade; that is, not below the standard which is recommended by the experts in their report.

That is the position of the matter. The Senate will, of course, have an opportunity of dealing with this item in the usual way when the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill comes on. I am anxious, if possible, to proceed with that Bill first to-morrow. I admit that in the very limited time at my disposal, I shall have very great difficulty in securing as much information as I should like. If, however, I can get a reasonable amount of information to enable me to submit the matter to the Senate I shall do so. There isa degree of urgency about it, and I simply mention that incidentally.
