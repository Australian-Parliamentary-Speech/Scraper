However, very practical effect has already been given to primage remission on tin plates. In October, 1933, the rates were reduced from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent., irrespective of the origin of the plate. The cumulative value of this remission to the end of April, 1938, has amounted to approximately £368,000. Drawback is allowed of the primage duty paid on tinned plate which is used in the manufacture of containers of goods exported from the Commonwealth, and consequently primary producers and others are under no disability in regard to their export trade by reason of this duty.","TIN PLATE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Collings) complained that the Government had not supplied the Senate with information regarding its defence proposals, but the very reason why the statement was submitted to the Senate before the Loan Bill covering some of the proposed expenditure on defence came before this chamber was that honorable senators should have before them the fullest possible information regarding the defence programme. The honorable gentleman went so far as to say that the Government was endeavouring to curtail discussion of this subject. I assure him, and honorable senators generally, that the Government welcomes the fullest discussion of its proposals. As one member of the Opposition said yesterday, the defence of Australia should be entirely removed from party politics. It is in that spirit that the Government has submitted its proposals. It welcomes the fullest co-operation of the Opposition and of all sections of the community in bringing into operation the policy submitted to the country. Last night members of the Opposition became very touchy when honorable senators on this side criticized the outlook of the Labour party in regard to defence. Particularly was that so when it was suggested from this side of the chamber that the Labour party had no defence policy at all. Yet the Leader of the Opposition himself was not particularly careful of the language that he employed in criticism of the Government's programme. At the very beginning of his speech he referred to the Government and its supporters as the friends of the armament racketeers. He suggested, further, that the defence policy of the Government was, to a great extent, dictated by people who had something to gain from the manufacture of armaments or munitions of war.

He realized, as we must realize, that in a time of national crisis it would not be possible for any government arsenal, or munition works, to supply the nation's full requirements. It is essential that we should organize industry in this country to enable it to play its part in the general scheme of providing the equipment essential to the defence of the nation.

When cadets from the Duntroon Military College have graduated they serve for a time with British regiments in India and in that way increase their knowledge considerably.' Why is there an exchange of ships between the British and Australian navies-vessels of tile Australian fleet being transferred to the Mediterranean station or China station and vessels of the British fleet serving in Australian waters? Rear Admirals of the British fleet also assume control of the Royal Australian Navy for specific periods and their service is of benefit to our own officers and also ensures more complete co-ordination in naval matters. These interchanges are made, not because it is thought that Australians are incapable of carrying out responsible work but because the arrangement is of benefit to the services concerned. During the last two years Sir Walter Kinnear and Mr. Ince, who have been closely associated with the control of national insurance in Great Britain have been in Australia formulating a health and unemployment insurance scheme for Australia and their assistance has been of inestimable benefit to the Government. .

It will be remembered that a bill on the same subject was introduced in the Senate by Sir George Pearce on the 18th June of last year and was eventually passed by this Chamber with amendments of only a minor character. The original Inter-State Commission Act of 1912 purported to set up an Inter-State Commission possessing judicial powers. I stress that point, because the Opposition is opposing this measure for the reasons which I am about to recite. In 1915, the High Court held that the judicial powers of the Inter-State Commission f-re unconstitutional; that meant that the most important part of the 1915 legislation, which had a great deal to recommend it, became inoperative. The commission, however, did not take the verdict of the High Court too literally and functioned for a time purely as an investigating body; but eventually suffered from heart failure and then collapsed. The glorified and expensive body which it is proposed to reconstitute under this bill will have only powers of investigation. It has been admitted that some States suffer disabilities as the result of federation, but nearly every one of these are disabilities as between a State or States and the Commonwealth. We, therefore, have the spectacle of the Commonwealth Government setting up an expensive commission in order to enquire into disabilities, for the creation and perpetuation of which it is itself responsible. States suffering any disability have (lie right of redress. If disabilities are due to unconstitutional action, a State has the right of appeal to the High Court, and any other disabilities can be ventilated in Parliament. I can see no reason whatever why this farcical body should be re-constituted. Members of the Opposition are not alone in this respect, as I can quote from fairly respectable public authorities, such as newspapers which are not in any way sympathetically disposed towards the Labour party, but have sufficient intelligence and honesty of purpose-a rare virtue in capitalist newspapers-to admit that the Government is wrong in proceeding with this proposal. On the 28th April last, the Melbourne Herald had something to say.","Second Reading","INTER-STATE COMMISSION BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The use of its name for a permanent royal commission does not give the proposed new body a recommendation. The only useful work that such a body could do would be to deal with needy State grant.s, work that is already being well and economically done by the Slate Grants Commission, which has laid down the principles of future procedure. The new permanent royal commission could have no judicial powers. It would merely make recommendation that it might or might not suit political interests to adopt. .

'Why was there delay in proceeding in the House of Representatives with the measure passed by this chamber? The reason is perfectly obvious.

I have, as a matter of fact, studied certain tomes which are a great deal older than those containing the reports of the proceedings of the former Inter-State Commission, and have found them not musty, but extraordinarily instructive and interesting. I refer to the proceedings of the last Federal Convention which was held in Melbourne in 1898. I have always been impressed with the directness' of the section of the Constitution relating to the establishment of an Inter-State Commission; it commences with the words, 'There shall be'. That, I think, is a rather unique introduction to the relevant provision. It is stated with particular abruptness that there shall be an InterState Commission. I confess that I have never quite understood why the provision was so framed. When the clause which eventually became the section was submitted to the Federal Convention in 1898, it read:-","Second Reading","INTER-STATE COMMISSION BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[2]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

' There shall be '. This amendment of the original clause was agreed to without a division. In other words, the convention was determined that the question of whether or not an Inter-State Commission was to be created should not be left to Parliament, but that it should be obligatory upon Parliament to appoint such a body. After relating briefly the history of what occurred at that time, I shall read a few extracts which show clearly the attitude of the leaders of the convention. Although the section of the Constitution to which I have referred was agreed to by the convention on the 25th February, 189S, the matter apparently still occupied the thoughts of some of the delegates, and on the 11th March of that year the clause was reconsidered. An amendment to omit the words ' There shall be ' and to insert the words ' Parliament may constitute ' was moved by Sir George Turner, a Victorian delegate. After debate, the amendment was negatived, the voting being 23 to 13 against it. Among those who voted with the majority were Sir John Forrest, Mr. Holder, Mr. Kingston, Mr. O'Connor. Mi-. George Reid, and Mr. Edmund Barton, while the minority included Sir Edward Braddon, Mr. Deakin, Mr. Lyne, Sir George Turner, and Mr. Isaac Isaacs.

In passing, may I say that there was no reference in the Constitution as originally framed to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which has since been established. Although great emphasis was not laid upon the fact that the InterState Commission was designed for the protection of the smaller States, the object of the convention in agreeing to its appointment was to ensure fair dealing between the States, and it was resolved that provision for the commis-sion should form a definite part of the Australian Constitution.","Second Reading","INTER-STATE COMMISSION BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Doubts having been raised as to whether Parliament might not postpone or decline to appoint the commission, the convention laid it clown, in the most explicit terms, that the Inter-State Commission was to be constituted. This meant that there should have been an Inter-State Commission from the inauguration of federation, whether it was operating, as the framers of the Constitution intended it should, or not. The reluctance on the part of the Parliament to appoint the commission has given rise to criticism in those States which feel that they have suffered certain disabilities under federation.

Most honorable senators will recall the finding of the High Court that the commission had no authority to make a judicial decision or to issue an injunction. But I wish to emphasize first a rather different point, namely, the precise work of the InterState Commission. Any honorable senator who studies the reports presented by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which in recent years ha3 been doing work which could have been entrusted to the Inter-State Commission had it been in existence, will admit that the statistical information contained in them is of great value, and could not very well have been compiled by members of Parliament sitting as a Parliament. Those reports are the results of intensive study in a committee room. It would be impossible for members of Parliament, whose time is fully occupied with the consideration of so many bills and reports bearing on legislative measures, to devote time to detailed examination of statistical information relating to claims by States. Moreover, members oi Parliament have not that detachment of mind which one would expect from members of a properly constituted Inter-State Commission whose deliberations would not he influenced so much by political or party considerations. I hope I have made my point clear to honorable senators. It will be recalled that a Labour government, desiring to authorize the Interstate Commission to exercise its power to the fullest extent, and not, I imagine with the intention of impairing the usefulness of that body, passed an act conferring on the commission very much wider powers than it had previously possessed. The commission duly exercised those powers, which later were challenged hy the Government of New South Wales. The case was heard in 1915. It was held that section 301 of the Commonwealth Constitution did not authorize the Parliament of the Commonwealth to constitute the Inter-State Commission a court, and therefore the provisions in Part V. of the Inter-State Commission Act 1912 were declared ultra vires the Parliament of the Commonwealth. This view was held by Chief Judge Griffith and Justices Isaacs, Powers and Rich, Justices Barton and Gavan Duffy dissenting.","Second Reading","INTER-STATE COMMISSION BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In the section of the' report dealing with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the State* (section xix 1 . reference is made to the sums of money granted from time to time to the Status of Western Australia and to Tasmaniaand to the grant to South Australia recently recommended by a royal commission.

We think that a permanent body should lie established which should continuously watch the effect of Federal laws and administrative machinery on the various States, and should be in a position to advise, either with or without a special inquiry, whenever applications for grants are made to the Commonwealth. The same permanent body should, we think, inquire into and report on such transactions as the agreement between the Government of the Commonwealth and of she State of Queenslaud relating to the purchase and disposal of the sugar crop and the embargo on imported raw sugar, and inquire into and report on proponed bounties, and the effect of the Navigation Act on the various States.

I emphasize that, if we intend to extend, as it is intended we .'hall extend, the operations which at present are carried out by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and h.md over to the Inter-State Commission. the investigation of grants to the three smaller States, it is obvious, as indicated not once, but twice, in the royal commission's report, that the Inter-State Commission should be also the adviser of the Government in regard to the sugar industry as it affects the State of Queensland and, indeed, all of the States. At intervals since the war, an agreement between the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government and the Queensland sugar interests has been submitted for our ratification, and we have been compelled either to reject or accept it. It would be rather high-handed procedure to reject an agreement of such importance after three different groups had approved of it. The sugar agreement legislation, I believe, is a matter of arrangement between the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government and the sugar interests, and no report is submitted for the guidance of Parliament. So far as I know, this Government has no impartial officials, or official body, to inquire into the whole of the facts in order to advise it whether the sugar agreement should be renewed, and if renewed, whether the terms should be more favorable or less favorable. So far as the tariff is concerned, we require and receive a report by an impartial official body-the Tariff Board-before any manufacturing industry can get assistance from the Commonwealth. Surely, it is fair and logical that, in respect of the Queensland sugar industry also, we should similarly have antecedent advice as to what is the actual position and on what terms, in the view of impartial inquirers, this Government should renew the sugar agreement.","Second Reading","INTER-STATE COMMISSION BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[20]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","168","MCLACHLAN, Alexander","KTR","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The special three years' defence programme contemplated by the Government has already been outlined in this chamber by the Minister for Repatriation (SenatorFoll). In doing so, he stated that approximately £45,000,000, or about £15,000,000 a year, will have to be found for the completion of the programme. The defence expenditure programme for the current year totalled £11,500,000, This amount was found as follows:-Practically the whole of this £11,500,000 will be expended or committed by the 30th June next, thus leaving no balances in the Defence TrustFunds uncommitted. As I have mentioned, £6,000,000 only is being found from the budget of 1937-38, and as the Government is to provide for a programme of £15,000,000 in the coming year 1938-39, £9,000,000 must be found from either revenue account or loan account over and above that found from the budget in 1937-38. Obviously, the Government is not yet in a position to give final consideration to this matter until the results of the current financial year are apparent, and until it is possible to make reasonably accurate forecasts of the accounts for 1938-39. Some months must elapse before this can be done. In the meantime, it is necessary that steps be taken to launch the programme without delay. Certain orders for additional defence equipment should he placed immediately. Expenditure at an increased rate must be authorized and the authority of Parliament obtained for certain items of expenditure which have not yet come before it. The Government is, therefore, asking Parliament for authority to raise loan moneys to the amount of £10,000,000, and will regard this appropriation as authority for the capital works set out in the schedule to the bill. It is, of course, not necessary that all of the £10,000,000 should be raised at once, or even in the near future. On this authorizing measure being passed, £4,000,000 out of the £10,000,000 will be raised at an early date. As an indication of urgency, I may say that it is desired to place orders before the 30th June next for capital works of a total value of £5,250,000. During 1938-39, a further £7,750,000 will be authorized. Very little of the expenditure of the £5.250,000 to which I have just referred will he expended during the current financial year. The loan programme of £10,000,000 will be allocated in the following manner :-These particulars are set out in the schedule to the bill. During the remainder of the current year, it will be necessary to go ahead with certain proposals which will involve an increase of ordinary maintenance votes as apart from capital authorizations. The additional expenditure for the year is comparatively small-about £70,000-and it is proposed to find this sum from Treasurer's Advance. The financial agreement exempts the Commonwealth from placing its defence loan requirements before the Australian Loan Council, and generally exempts them from the provisions of the financial agreement. In view, however, of the fact that the present £10,000,000 required for defence will be taken out of the same market as that which supplies the requirements for State loan programmes, the position was explained to the recent meeting of the Loan Council in Melbourne. The Loan Council, as the result of its deliberations, decided to raise a loan of £10,250,000 in the near future. Of this, £4,000,000 will he for defence, and the balance, £6,250,000, for public works, and the like, for the various governments. The reason for combining the requirements of the Commonwealth and States in one loan was to minimize the number of appeals' to investors for loan moneys. The Commonwealth pro-portion of £4,000,000 will cover defence requirements during the early part of 1938-39. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the new loan cannot be placed on the market until Parliament has passed the bill under consideration, and has thereby authorized the schedule of expenditure. Honorable senators will, therefore, realize that it is very desirable for the measure* to he finalized as soon as practicable, and I accordingly ask them to co-operate with the Government in securing its early passage. As the subject-matter of the bill has been discussed from all aspects during the debate on the statement made by the Minister for Repatriation, there is, I think, no necessity to discuss in detail its principles, but if any information is desired by honorable senators I shall be happy to supply it in committee.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It is quite unnecessary, I am sure, to repeat at this stage that the Opposition is definitely opposed to the authorization of vastly increased expenditure upon defence, particularly as it has not been taken into the confidence of the Government. It has not been informed, except in very indefinite terms, just how the money is to he spent. 'While the Opposition is of the opinion that the defence of Australia is exceedingly important, it also holds the view that no defence expenditure should be permitted without the most careful scrutiny, because the history of every country, including Australia, is that nothing offers such inducement to profiteering and nepotism a3 money spent upon military operations. In response to comments by various members of my party and, perhaps, myself in particular, with respect to the farming out of defence undertakings to private enterprise, the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) stated that no profits will be made by any industrial concerns, but the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Foll) told honorable senators very clearly that action is to be taken to enable a close check to be made of the cost of production of munitions, and to facilitate the control of profits made by the manufacturers. I assume that a responsible Minister of the Crown would not suggest that profits are to be controlled if he were convinced that there would be no profits. Members of the Opposition continually protest against being treated like school children when they ask for information. There is a great difference between the amount indicated in the schedule as required for defence works and that for which authority is sought to be raised by loan, and the whole of the money is to be paid to people who have no right or title to it. I repeat what I said yesterday that all y government that proposes to finance preparations for war by raising a loan commits an unmoral act. The nation receives no return upon money spent in preparation for defence or upon the conduct of a war. A war, whether of aggression or defence, causes the destruction, not the production, of assets. When I referred yesterday to wasting assets it was suggested that I was so foolish as to think that money could be spent only on war materials that could not be classed as wasting assets; but every penny spent upon the production of war material is spent upon the creation of wasting assets, and in a few years many of the works detailed in the schedule of the bill will not be merely wasting assets, but will have disappeared entirely. 1 know the reply I shall receive to the comment that in order to pay for defence, social services will be starved, and I perceive the sophistry of it. I shall be told that if we are not properly prepared for defence our social services will be of no value whatever because they will become non-existent. Sophistry of that kind does not cut any ice with the Opposition. Every country that engages in war declares that it, is a war of defence, not aggression. Australia is in no different position in that connexion from any other country. Members of the Labour party agree that Australia must be defended. Our opponents in this chamber and in the other chamber assert that we have no defence policy, but T have in my hands a document from which I have quoted on previous occasions. I do not propose to read at length from it now, but I would point out that the party's defence policy occupies two pages of the document and explains exactly what we propose for the defence of this country. I shall read some passages in an endeavour to make it clear that those who charge the party with having no defence policy are untruthful and arc guilty of falsehood.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

But what has the Government done, during the last six years, to remedy the oil situation, apart from submitting during the closing hours of last session a bill authorizing payment of £500,000 to certain financial interests to which the Government has already handed over control of the Cockatoo Dockyard? In other words, instead of safeguarding the rights of the people in respect of the defence of the country, tin* Government is deliberately bartering those rights to private enterprise. Then the Government and its supporters have the impudence to tell the Opposition, as Senator Leckie did yesterday, that the manufacturers do not desire one penny of profit from the work to be carried out under this bill. Such a statement is an insult to the intelligence of the little band of senators who constitute the Opposition. I do not say that it is an insult to the intelligence of other senators, because the Government apparently has their measure and can do what it likes with them. But it 'cannot make such statements without a protest on the part of the Opposition. Why should a loan be floated to raise the money required by the Government? There are in. this country wealthy interests which have far more to defend than is possessed by the mass of the people, is it not a splendid thing to have the sinews of war in order to defend the miserable basic wage of the worker and the apology for a home that he is able to wrest from the capitalistic order of society? Is it not also a fine idea to ask the worker to sacrifice his life for those things? He cannot be asked to sacrifice his wealth, because he does not possess any. But there are powerful interests in this country that possess more than a fair share of the public and private wealth of the nation.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[4]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

When I asked whether social services were to be starved because of the alleged need for increased defence expenditure, I was assured by the Minister for Repatriation that there was no such intention. Professor Brigden, in 1935, when he was Director of the Bureau of Industry in Queensland, pointed out that the ItaloAbyssinian war must necessarily have an adverse effect upon Australian loan funds and employment. He said that the trouble would certainly influence London funds, and, through them, bank credit in Australia. The amount of loan money available would be reduced, and State programmes for employment would be affected. That was not the statement of a Labour supporter, but of a man whom this Commonwealth Government has now secured to advise it on its insurance scheme. He declared that it was impossible for wars and preparation for wars to be carried on without Australian conditions being affected. Thus, while social services are becoming increasingly necessary, the capacity of the country to satisfy the financial needs of those services will become less and less.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The first defence step which should be undertaken J repeat, is to put our internal affairs in order so that we may have a country worth defending, and in order that every able-bodied man and woman, having remunerative employment, will be anxious to defend it. The Labour party,-in recent years at all events, has stood firmly for the voluntary system of training and against compulsory military service. We believe that the health of the youth of this country is an important factor in a defence scheme. On this point it is interesting to recall that on Tuesday night last, Mr. Holt, a member of the United Australia party in the House of Representatives, was informed by the Prime Minister that in the last year of the compulsory system of military training 32 per cent, of the young men called up were rejected on the ground of physical unfitness, while under the voluntary system the number of rejects was 4 per cent., showing that the authorities are now obliged to accept a lower standard for the forces. We on this side believe that the Government is not going the right way about the business of defending this country. Six years ago the Prime Minister ('Mr. Lyons) stressed the urgent need for the standardization of our railway gauges. This, he said, would provide a great amount of employment, and prove of very valuable assistance in the defence of the country. Yet he has done little or nothing in this connexion. We contend that the health of the people should have first consideration, and that the conditions under which they are living need urgent revision. Since the Government intends to make a survey of the capacity of our manufacturing establishments to furnish materials in time of war, we say it should also give consideration to the wages and working conditions of the Australian men and women with a view to improving their capacity to protect this country in time of need. There is nothing unreasonable in this suggestion. We say further that the allocation, of the proposed expenditure on the various arms of the service is not the best that could have been made. I dissociate myself from any suggestion that I am posing as an expert in this matter. I merely suggest that the revolutionary changes in the methods of warfare, as disclosed in conflicts in other countries, indicates the wisdom of giving, much greater attention to the development of our air defences. This opinion, I believe, will be borne out by the experience of every country that is ravaged by war, and it will have our endorsement if, unfortunately, war comes tothese shores.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

We shall assist to pass this bill because we believe in measures being taken to defend Australia. 'We shall, however, exercise our right of criticism of its proposals. We say that every penny of the amount required for defence should be financed by the Commonwealth Bank. There should be no approach to the overseas market for loans to finance war expenditure; wo object to all underwriting and exchange charges. The Government should follow the historic precedent of 1914, and raise any money required for defence through the Commonwealth Bank, so that private trading banks will not get a 'rake-off'. We say, further, that the Government should prevent any private enterprise concern from making a profit from defence expenditure. Yesterday, we were told that Australian manufacturers have no desire whatever to make profits from their business. That statement is not true. I am convinced that private manufacturers will not undertake anything except under compulsion unless they 'see a profit in it. If a Labour government had the spending of these extra millions for defence, it would see that the money was devoted to the betterment of the conditions of the people in order that they could more effectively defend this country. I should like to be informed exactly where and amongst whom the Government intends to spend all this money. I do not intend to move any amendment to the bill, but I suggest that-it would be helpful if the Government declared its resolve not to repeat in Australia the mistakes that have been made in other countries in connexion with defence contracts. It could avoid these mistakes if it appointed a committee of members representing all parties in this Parliament whose duty would be to scrutinize carefully every item of expenditure, thus ensuring that the Government got 20s. worth of value for every £l expended.

During the Great War, we spent many millions of pounds in Australia on equipment and munitions for our troops,, and in every contract placed with Australian manufacturers every care was taken to prevent undue profits from being made. The bulk of the expenditure was for uniforms and other equipment for the troops. In every instance the Defence Department made a careful estimate of the cost of the various articles required and fixed the contracts on that basis. Let me take boots as an illustration. It ascertained the lowest cost price for the making of a pair of boots and then said to individual contractors: 'If yon like to supply military boots at the figure which wc have fixed, you can have a contract for 10,000> or 12,000 pairs.' The same procedure was followed with regard to other requirements. My point is that the cost was determined by the department after careful investigations had been made by responsible officers, and contracts were given to private manufacturers at prices fixed by the department. Throughout the war no profiteering on war equipment was allowed in Australia. That may be news to the honorable senator, but he talks glibly as if all defence expenditure were associated with profiteering.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/interjection[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

If there is anything on which the Commonwealth Government has expended money, it is the endeavour to find local supplies of oil. The expenditure by the Commonwealth Government on that objective runs into millions of pounds. In New Guinea, alone, the previous Government, a Labour Government, spent no less than £300,000 in boring and searching for oil. Last year the Commonwealth Government spent many thousands of pounds in subsidizing companies engaged in the search for oil on the mainland, and to-day it is not only subsidizing companies but also providing them with boring plants. The Newnes shale project also has been mentioned, and Commonwealth Oil Refineries is another phase of the continuous attempt of the Commonwealth Government to ensure local supplies of oil.

I agree with him to this extent : Loans are unjustifiable for annual expenditure on defence maintenance; such cost3 should be borne out of revenue. Expenditure on defence should be looked at in the same light as premiums for fire or life assurance. A business man would be a fool to try to pay fire or life insurance premiums out of capital; he would of course try to pay them from current revenue. If I were running a business I should pay premiums out of profits, but if I were acquiring an appliance to prevent or fight fires, it would be justifiable to charge the cost to capital account. The expenditure provided for in this bill is mainly of a capital character; very little of it relates to maintenance. The honorable senator made another rash and irresponsible statement-he is a very rash person, although one would expect that at his age he would have acquired discretion-when he said that the greater part of this money would be expended outside Australia. He had before him at the time the schedule which the Minister has circulated.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[13]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I wish first of all to congratulate the Government on the steps it is at last taking to endeavour to prepare this country for its proper defence. Personally, I am sorry that these moneys were not borrowed at an earlier date, and that the defence programme was not put forward some years ago, because now, with world conditions as they unfortunately are, it will be necessary to hurry on that expenditure, with the result perhaps that we shall not be able to get as much value for £1 spent as we would have got had we started some years ago. Unfortunately, this Government has to revive and develop the defences of the country after the Scullin Labour Government had scrapped practically the whole of them, including those national assets, the Duntroon Military College, and the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay. In fact, under that Government, the defence of Australia was scrapped almost entirely, and that is one of the reasons why such a large sum of money as that provided for in this bill has to be raised; we have to build on foundations which, if they were not ruined, were at least, seriously weakened by the neglect of the Labour Government. The closing of the colleges at Duntroon and Jervis Bay was tragic. Both of those institutions were a great credit to Australia,, and they turned out some fine young officers who subsequently distinguished themselves in India, Great Britain and Australia. I am very glad that the military college has been returned to Duntroon, and that the number of cadets to be trained there-and very efficiently trained too-are to be increased as are the number of naval cadets at Flinders. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Collings), in his tirade this afternoon, gave me the impression that he was not so very sincere about the defence of Australia as he pretended. He said, that Labour sincerely believes in the adequate defence of Australia, but he went on to say that the money to be raised under this bill would largely go to profiteers, and be spent outside Australia. * The implication was . that unless every penny was expended in Australia, n)o money should be spent on defence at all. With reference to the proposed purchase of cruisers from Great Britain-thank goodness that we have the Mother Country willing and able to provide us with the vessels and not at profiteering prices-the honorable senator said that if they could not be built in Australia, they should not be acquired at all. Senator Pearce who had a long and distinguished experience in the Defence Department has just said that of this loan of £10,300,000, fully £8,500,000 will be expended in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition also spoke about employment. If he is sincere, he must know that the expenditure in Australia of more than £8,000,000 on the building of aerodromes, aeroplanes, sloops, munitions and everything else connected with defence, will give a vast amount of employment to our people. I have already referred to the calibre of the officers that have graduated from the Royal Military College, and this brings me to one point at which I am in disagreement with the Government. It intends to import an Inspector-General of the Australian Military Forces from England. I think, that our Australian generals conclusively proved in the last awful world war that they were equal to any. I believe, and I have a great deal of support, that there was no better general in the field than the late Lieutenant-General Sir John Monash. He was only one of many able Australian generals who distinguished themselves. Some of them are alive and fit to-day, and 1 think their services would be available to the Government for the work for which a man is to be imported. It would be invidious to mention names, but if honorable senators read books of military history, whether British, French or Gernian, they will see that the Australian generals were very good indeed, and as they have proved their worth, I think it is a pity that the Government did not decide to appoint an inspector-general from within Australia.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

At Fishermen's Bend, near Melbourne, the Commonwealth Government is having aeroplanes built at the rate of two a week. In my opinion the work of aeroplane manufacture there should be speeded up. By working three shifts, instead of two, the factory could turn out three machines a week. That, would be 150 in a year, which, although not a great number, would be-a step in the right direction. The air force would play an important part in the defence of Australia should this country be attacked. In defending a sparsely populated island continent, with a coast line of 12,000 miles, it would, in fact, be our most important arm of defence.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

We are indeed fortunate in that we can obtain from Great Britain those things, such as cruisers, which we cannot produce economically in Australia. Some years ago when a cruiser was built in Australia it was almost obsolete before it was launched. The Mother Country has gone out of its way to supply us with vessels at reasonable prices.

There is, however, a good deal of overlapping; and when there is overlapping there is waste. The topographical staff of the Defence Department is altogether inadequate for the task. According to some authorities, a compre-hensive survey of Australia would take 150 years to complete at the present rate of progress. As this is a national question, the Commonwealth should expedite the work as much as possible and seek the co-operation of the States. No one, either in the Defence Department or elsewhere, knows the northern part of Australia thoroughly, yet that is the part of the continent which would most likely be attacked in the event of war. A thorough survey of the northern part of the continent should be undertaken without delay, and if the Commonwealth has not a sufficient staff to do the job, it should seek the assistance of the States, even if it has to pay for the services rendered. An important factor in the defence of Australia which is sometimes overlooked is the necessity for maintaining friendly relations with those nations which own islands immediately north of Australia. One nation possesses a chain of islands stretching right down to the equator, and from what we can learn, those islands are equipped with bases for destroyers, submarines and aircraft. Not many people realize how close those islands are to New Guinea, over portion of which Australia has a mandate. As one of the islands to which I have referred is only 50 miles from the equator, it is of the utmost importance that we should be on friendly terms, and work in the closest co-operation with, a nation which controls the other islands in the vicinity. I regard that aspect of the defence of Australia, as of almost paramount importance. Australia's air force, although not large is of excellent quality. I attended the air pageant held recently at Flemington, Victoria, and was proud of the exhibition. It was a magnificent display in every detail. As all the world knows, Australia has airmen equal to the best that any country can produce. Many Australians, like the late Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith and others, have made world-wide reputations as airmen. Within three weeks of the pageant, in which I have referred, 4,000 young men in Victoria alone offered themselves for service in the Royal Australian Air Force. There is no dearth of men who are willing to be trained as pilots, but there is a shortage of machines. I am glad, therefore, that much of the money to be raised under this bill will be expended on the air force.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I am opposed to spending millions of pounds on the standardization of the railway gauges, not only because of the huge cost of the undertaking but, more particularly, because railways are becoming obsolete. The transport of the future will be along roads and in the air. Motor transport is more mobile than is transport by rail, but, of course, air transport is the most mobile of all-In a large country like Australia, air transport is essential for defence purposes. I am giving away no secret when I say that when Earl Kitchener was in Australia in 3909, I was sent for to consult with him, because at that time I was the managing director of a pastoral property on the Barkly Tableland, where good horses were bred. The British Government contemplated buying that and other properties as horse-breeding depots for the Indian army. One of the last things that Earl Kitchener said to me was that it would be most unwise to build the north-south railway. He explained that its construction would play into the hands of any aggressor who might attack Australia. He went on to say that one of the greatest factors in the defence of Australia was the barrenness of the coastal strip in the north. He said that in the event of invasion, the driving of the herds before the invading army, as was done in Africa, would seriously hamper the enemy's progress. Having emphasized the importance of motor and air transport, 1 now exhort the Government to provide large supplies of oil fuel in Australia. The present supplies are inadequate, and, moreover, they are neither well spaced nor sufficiently concealed. Whilst 1 agree that the production of oil from shale and other products for peace use is not sound economically, I regard it as absolutely necessary to press on with the Newnes oil scheme and the distillation of fuel oils. I also urge that large stocks of oil fuel be provided in different parts of Australia where they will not be too conspicuous. Recently I asked a question about oil supplies and was informed that the Government had the matter in hand. I commend the Government for its general defence policy, but I am not convinced that it has made adequate provision for supplies of oil fuel in case of emergency. In an excellent speech, Senator Courtice mentioned yesterday that the British Empire had made great efforts to preserve the peace of the world. I was glad to hear that statement from the honorable senator, and also his approbation of the scheme of re-armament that had been undertaken by Great Britain. Not many people in Australia realize that the Mother Country is expending more than £300,000,000 a year on defence. Not one-third of that expenditure would be necessary to protect Great Britain itself-a comparatively small country with a population of about 47,000,000 people. It is spending the bulk of the money for the defence of the dominions, of which Australia is one, and also for the protection of the trade routes. Its huge navy is not necessary to defend the British Isles, but it is required, and is maintained,-in order to protect the interests of the Mother Country's children, who are scattered to the four corners of the world. I disagree with the suggestion of the Labour party that we should defend only Australia. Where is it proposed that we should defend Australia? Surely it is not suggested that we should allow an enemy to come here, and take no action until we are attacked? It is quite probable that in time of trouble our base will be at Singapore. With our Navy, our Air Force, and any other means that we have, we must work in the closest co-operation with Great Britain and the sister dominions of New Zealand, Canada and South Africa, and we must not wait until an enemy attacks us. The Leader of the Opposition in another place (Mr. Curtin), in his famous blue book, said that Australia should not send its Navy or its man power outside the 3-mile limit. My friends of the Labour party have never explained to my satisfaction what they would do in the event of the sister dominion of New Zealand being attacked. Should we remain within the 3-mile limit, or go to its assistance? Great Britain's efforts have been marvellous. It is still policing the seven seas of the world, not in an aggressive manner, but with a view to ensuring freedom of trade to every nation. One of the greatest bulwarks for the safety of Australia is, undoubtedly, Singapore. I have said that I agree with the Labour party in stressing the importance of the Air Force. I have been told by military authorities in this country, and I was told in Europe during my visit there last year, that Australia would be reasonably safe if it had a sufficient number of bombing planes stationed along the north coast of Australia. Although it has not been shown that a bomber can sink a battleship, it can certainly sink transports. Any country that proposed to attack Australia would need a tremendous number of transports. A fleet of transports can travel only as fast as the slowest vessel in it, and they are most vulnerable to attack from the air.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[7]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I am very sorry that that is so. It shows that there is something deplorably wrong, and indicates the desirability of establishing some form of universal physical training throughout Australia. In a country with such a wonderful climate, which produces the best food in the world, and which turns out athletes who can hold their own anywhere, there is no excuse for such a large proportion of our young people who offer themselves for service in the militia being discarded on account of physical unfitness. That condition of affairs should be remedied. A little drill would not do any harm. Senator Collings has stated that a certain degree of hardship is associated with the training. I maintain that there is none. While undergoing training as cadets at school we had a lot of fun and sport, and were taught to be manly. That training did us good both physically and morally. It gave us self-respect. Surely the young men of Australia would not object to being made physically fit and to being taught something about the rudiments of defence. I refer, not to compulsory military training for the purpose of sending men overseas, but to some form of physical military training which would fit them as good citizens to defend their country in case of emergency. Honorable senators opposite have also referred to the subject of employment. Senator Collings has said that the most important thing in this country is not to spend this money on defence, but to make the lot of the people as nearly ideal as possible. I agree with the latter suggestion. Any human being who has any feeling for his fellow men surely must always wish to help the under-dog, and to raise the standard of living. That is only ordinary decency and humanity, and, in my opinion, common sense. I would point out, however, that during the regime of the Scullin Government the unemployment figures in Australia reached the high level of 30 per cent. Since the present Government came into power, employment has increased to such an extent that to-day the figures are down to as low as 8 per cent., which is below normal. Unfortunately, there will always be a few persons who are more or less unemployable. I consider that, in addition to a stocktaking of the health of the youth of Australia, there should be a national stocktaking, because in time of emergency everybody should be able to do something. We should collect information with respect to the man power of Australia between the ages of 18 and 65 years, or even older than that. After a man has passed the military age, he should be an expert in some branch of work or industry. We should all be ticketed, so that in time of national emergency we may be allocated to the particular jobs for which we are best fitted. I am very keen on such a proposal, and believe that steps should be taken to implement it. In regard to finance, some honorable senators opposite have said that the Commonwealth is more or less crippling the States. What do we find? Out of the money raised by the Loan Council the Commonwealth Government has made available to the States for public works, roads and farmers' debt adjustment many millions of pounds. [ consider that it has been liberal to the States. It is entitled to 20 per cent, of the total amount borrowed by the Loan Council, yet at the end of the year, after making a very liberal allocation to the States for farmers' debt adjustment and roads, it will take only 4 per cent., instead of the amount to which it is entitled. I support the Government in the raising and spending of this money, with the proviso that I should like provision to be made for a much stronger air force in the north of Australia, and immediate steps to be taken for the distillation of oil supplies for emergency purposes.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[11]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The honorable senator evidently thought it was advisable to arm himself yesterday with a double-barrelled blunderbuss, one barrel to be discharged yesterday, and another to-day. Fortunately, both barrels were filled with blank cartridges, with the result that, when they were discharged, there was only a lot of smoke and noise. That has been the only effect on honorable senators. In this chamber Senator Collings has gained the reputation of being a past-master in the art of using what I know as soap-box oratory. This oratory may go down with an audience on Yarra Bank, in Melbourne, the Domain, in Sydney, or the place where people of the same type congregate in Brisbane. To use it here is to insult the intelligence of the people in Australia, of whom we are the representatives. Time after time the honorable senator has stood up in this chamber., and, in unmeasured terms, denounced the Government which controls the destinies of Australia to-day with respect to practically every matter it has brought forward for discussion. As a political acrobat I know of no one who is the equal of the honorable senator. He can always trim his sails to meet what he thinks is public opinion. The important matter that we are now considering deserves much more serious attention than has evidently been given to it by Senator Collings, who is the leader of a very important party in this chamber. Personally, I must view the matter from an Australian viewpoint. I have first to consider whether any government is justified in retaining its position unless it is prepared to take adequate measures for the defence of Australia. At the outset I ask myself if Australia is worth defending. The only answer that 1 can make is that there is no country on the face of the earth which offers as many advantages to the square yard as Australia offers to the square foot. Every one who has travelled knows that, and, if fair, is prepared to admit it. If that be so, surely we arc justified in considering favorably any measure which may have for its object the more adequate defence of this beloved country!","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

He argues that the wealthy capitalists of Australia should be called upon to pay out of their pockets for the cost of the defence of this country. He professes to be a champion of the rights of the under-dog-the working man-and is always denouncing the government of the day for not using every means possible to reduce the volume of unemployment in this country; yet he advocates a course of action which, if followed, must necessarily increase unemployment immediately. If he is earnest in what he says, he would withdraw for all time from the capitalist-I do not know whether he has in mind the individual or the financial institution-the amount requisite to carry out those measures of defence which are needed in Australia. He does not realize, apparently, that that money is to-day being utilized in every direction in the best interests of the mass of the people, that it cannot be of any use to the holder of it unless it is in circulation earning something, and that it cannot earn anything unless it is enabling people to produce. The honorable senator ignores that fact, and suggests that we should 'be very much better off if WE imposed enormously heavy taxation, or even went so far as to confiscate the capital of those who have always had to pay heavy taxation in time of war, or when any costly measure of defence has had to be put in operation. The great bulk of the receipts from taxation come from those to whom Senator Collings refers as the capitalists. He knows that, but is not prepared to admit it, because he does not think it would find favour with individuals of the type he is so apt at addressing in the capital cities of the Commonwealth. f heartily support this measure, but, at the same time. 1. regret very much the necessity for it. I had hoped that long before this, signs of peace would have appeared upon the horizon. Honorable senators must admit, however, that until the. last week or two no such signs were in evidence. Certainly, there has been a change for the better in the international situation, hut no such change was apparent when this Government determined to do its duty with regard to the defence of Australia. I remind honorable senators i that, although Great Britain, for many years now, has been the greatest factor in preventing another world war, it has been a much greater factor in that respect since it decided upon a policy of re-armament. Honorable senators opposite should not forget that fact. Although Britain has by its influence prevented, time after time, the outbreak of war during the last eight or ten years, its influence for peace has been much greater recently because it has embarked upon a policy of active defence and re-armament. shall confine myself to the broad principle of the measure as to whether we should authorize the expenditure of so large a sum of money in order to strengthen our defences. Should the need arise, our country is worth fighting for, and such expenditure is necessary. I repeat my regret on that point, and take this opportunity to suggest that we in Australia can help to avoid further expenditure in this direction if, as public men, and as individuals, in the street and in the homes of the people, we endeavour to the best of our ability to inculcate a desire to help in the work of international goodwill. I believe that that is the only solution of this problem. Possibly, because we have lived for so long in so blessed a country, and have been protected for so many years by Great Britain, we regard ourselves as a superior people; but the people of Australia should recognize that the people of every other nation have as much pride in their nationhood as we have, and that we cannot hope for world peace if we fail to cultivate a spirit which recognises that those other peoples have as much right as we have to exist. We should, therefore, inculcate a spirit of brotherhood and kindliness especially by refraining on the floors of our legislatures from making provocative utterances which may sow the seed of hatred between nations. If we apply ourselves to that task, I. am hopeful of seeing a spirit of international friendship so firmly established that we shall not be called upon to supplement our expenditure on defence. J. make those remarks in the hope that some good may be effected in that direction. I shall not be a member of this chamber for much longer, but if it is my last utterance here, I feel it worth while to say that nothing would give me greater pleasure than to spend the rest of my days in an endeavour to render further expenditure on defence unnecessary, or in helping to create international goodwill.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Not long ago he told us of another first line of defence which included, I think, some method of improving the physical standard of the young.

He should remember that ' those who take the sword shall perish by the sword ', and that those who resort to violent language and misrepresentation of a policy of a party must not be surprised if the party against which it is directed is prepared to defend itself by the same weapon which he himself has employed.

Senator Pearce asked Senator Collings if the situation was not such as to cause anxiety, but he declined to answer the question. Yet, if he knows anything of world affairs he must know that that is so. He knows what happened in Austria a few weeks ago, and he also knows what happened in the demilitarized zone on the Rhine a year or two ago. He should realize that we live in an age when the rules of international law no longer operate and that in international affairs we have got back to the law of the Scottish Borderers ' He may take who has the power, and he may keep who can'. Are we not wise in taking every precaution against these things? But, as Senator Pearce said, the Leader of the Opposition draws no distinction between defence and war. As has already been pointed out, to be prepared for waT is the best way to avoid it. There is an old Latin saying ' If you want peace be prepared for war '. Those who have read Gilbert Chesterton's autobiography will recall that he said that if he were asked what caused the war he was not going to say that it was the Kaiser, but he would say it was the pacifist. If it had been made clear, he said, before the war and at its outset, what England's position would he, the war would not have taken place, but, owing to the cry of pacifism, it was believed that Great Britain would not intervene and Germany was tempted to go on. There are old sayings about 'jumping our hurdles before we get to them,' or ' meeting trouble half way ' and 'nodding to the devil before you meet him,' hut that does not apply to defence. Defence is necessarily a slow process, and there is no virtue in a peace which consists in sitting still until our enemies are strong enough to destroy us. So far as I can understand, and having regard to the criticism which every measure of defence receives from honorable senators opposite, that, apparently, is their policy. As Lord Halifax said a few days ago-The world faces the ugly truth that, in the sphere of power politics force alone decides. It is the ruthless application of power politics which so profoundly shocked the world and which is responsible for the grave apprehension which exists in so many quarters to-day.

That statement has not been denied. We shall also oppose the bill because the Government has not taken honorable senators into its confidence as to the reason why moneys additional to those asked for in December are sought. Apparently, the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) thinks that the people of Australia believe that there are reasons why this loan should be raised, but Parliament has not been told what those reasons are. lt is unfair not only to Parliament but also to the people. We say that if there are reasons we should know them. We know that pronouncements have been made by responsible Ministers of the British Government that the international situation ha3 eased considerably within the last few weeks. Therefore, we may take it that the danger is not as evident to-day as it was four or five weeks ago; yet we are asked to agree to this bill without being furnished with the information necessary to enable us to cast an intelligent vote upon it. During this debate Senator Pearce said that during the regime of the Labour Government which preceded the first Lyons Government, the defence system of Australia had been allowed to go into recess, or words to that effect. No honorable senator in this chamber knows better than Senator Pearce that the Labour Government was refused money from London at a time when Australia was facing a financial crisis.

That, of necessity, would bring about a reduction of the expenditure of the Defence Department. Another aspect which must also be taken into account when considering the actions of the Labour Government, is that it must be realized that although the Scullin Government was in office, it was not in power; a hostile majority in this chamber declined to pass what the Government believed to be important legislation. The result, as honorable senators know, is old history; the Scullin Goverrnment went out of office and was followed by the first Lyons Government, and a government led by Mr. Lyons has been in office ever since. But what effort has been made by the present Government in the past to put the defence system of Australia on a proper basis? The Government has been in office for over five years, during the whole of which it has had a huge majority in this chamber; at any time during those yearsit could have passed such legislation as it desired to put the defence system of Australia on a proper footing; but it neglected to do so. Now it asks the Parliament to pass this bill without supplying the necessary information to honorable senators to enable them to cast an intelligent vote upon it. It is proposed that we shall embark upon an expenditure of over £43,000,000 over the next three years, but no provision has been made to rehabilitate the workers who will be engaged on works in connexion with the defence policy, but who will lose their employment upon the expiration of that time. It would appear that the Government is desirous of following the lead of the British Government, but we are informed in the press to-day that a responsible British Minister lias made a pronouncement that plans are in preparation for the rehabilitation of workers who will be' thrown out of industry as the result of the completion of the defence plan in Great Britain. No less a sum than £500,000,000 has been provided for this purpose. Australia has a population equal to approximately oneseventh of that of Great Britain. What does the Australian Government propose to do for the purpose of subsequently providing employment for those people who we have been told to-day will secure employment as the result of the expenditure outlined in the programme before the Senate? No pronouncement of the Government's intentions in this respect has been made. Provision for the employment of those people should be portion of the defence plan of Australia. We cannot allow our people to go right up to the expiration of the three-years period without making a definite plan for their employment, and it takes time to make preparations necessary for the rehabilitation of those who will be thrown out of employment. It seems to me that it is fortunate, indeed, that there is to be a change in the personnel of this chamber shortly. We have heard senator after senator f' on the opposite side rise in his .'< 'e and make a bitter attack on the Leader of the Opposition. In the near future the Leader of the Opposition will be amply supported in repelling those attacks.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

No statement of its reasons has been made by the Government and, in view of the fact that the position of those factories renders them particularly vulnerable to attack, a statement should be forthcoming. Defence factories should be established in the various States, not only for the sake of efficiency, but also to ensure that each State shall get its fair share of the work that will be available for the construction and staffing of those factories. If that were done much of the unemployment in the States would be relieved, and the Government would honour its undertaking that the extra taxation imposed for defence purposes would be expended in such a way as to relieve unemployment in the States. Honorable senators representing States other than Victoria will probably be questioned in regard to this matter, because, as I have said, England has set us an example by adopting a policy of decentralization of defence factories. That policy should be followed in Australia. Senator Guthrie to-night, when discussing Labour's defence policy, made some references to the three-mile limit, and said that he obtained his information from Mr. Curtin's blue book.

The modern trend is towards motor and aerial transport. [ believe that the Government would act wisely if it spent a substantially larger sum of money on road works, and substantially less on some of these so-called defence projects. If the Commonwealth Government would act in coordination with the State governments, a great deal could be done to develop country districts which to-day do not enjoy good roads. The provision of up-to-date highways would give our producers better access to markets. As Australia will not be able in the future to look to the British Navy for assistance as has hitherto been the case, we ought to do as much as we can to improve our own position. The purpose of Labour senators in participating in this debate is to make constructive suggestions to that end. I regret that a good deal of the debate on this measure has consisted of personal remarks. While I am a member of the Senate, I hope to devote myself to constructive criticism. I commend that attitude to honorable senators opposite. They should be more tolerant, of the views of those who differ from them. At present only four or five Labour senators occupy seats in this chamber and the Government ought to act reasonably towards them. I am sure that after the 30th June, when the Opposition strength in the chamber will be greatly increased, we shall act in a reasonable spirit towards the Government. I observed in the speech which I delivered last night, that one of the most effective steps which the Government could take towards the fulfilment of any defence programme would be to expedite all efforts to ensure an independent oil supply for Australia. In New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and other States which have shale deposits, intensive action should be taken to produce oil. States which have no shale deposits, but which have coal-fields, could also be ncluded in a plan with this object. It can never be said that Australia is self-contained until independent oil supplies are assured within this country. If, as part of its defence policy, the Government would take some effective acton in this regard, it would simultaneously be doing a great service to commercial interests. During the inquiry in 1933 into the possibility of producing oil from shale at Newnes, the price of petrol in Sydney dropped very remarkably. This is shown by the following extract from the report of the Newnes Investigation Committee presented to Senator A. J. McLachlan, as the then Minister in Charge of Development for the Commonwealth, and to the Honorable R. S. Vincent, Minister of Mines for New South Wales :-","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I do not wish to challenge the accuracy of the figure given in that report, but I know that only 370 men are employed in the Small Arms Factory at present.

Now, however, we find that £60,000 is to be provided for buildings, and this notwithstaziding that the pioneer munitions factory, that at Lithgow, is working to only one-fifth of its capacity. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are to be expended upon exploring the possibilities of manufacturing munitions by private enterprise while the Government's own munitions factories are almost idle. The Minister for Defence, who represents a New South Wales constituency, will surely have to answer to his electors for this, just as the members of this Senate will have to answer to the electors in the various States for the unfair allocation of defence expenditure throughout the Commonwealth. I believe that economy should be subordinated to efficiency in defence matters, and that every effort should be made to promote employment among our own people. I am far from satisfied with the position in regard to the Lithgow factory. Hundreds of men in the district who have been trained in the use of the various machines are now out of work. During the hearing of an application recently for increased wages and improved conditions by workers in the factory, the manager stated that he could take men from the gate, and put them to work on any of the machines in the factory within 24 hours. It is clear, therefore, that it is not necessary to have skilled labour to tend these machines. They are fool-proof, and can be worked by men almost entirely unskilled. I admit that there is a shortage of skilled labour in the engineering trade, but that does not affect the Lithgow factory. I have been informed that there has been machinery in that, factory for years that has never been opened up. I suggest to the Government that it should give consideration to the claims of States other than Victoria for a share in the defence expenditure, so that the carry ing out of the Government's defence programme may help to reduce unemployment in all the States.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/para[5]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The item to which he has directed my attention is an expenditure of £50,000 for additions for metallurgical laboratories, chemical defence purposes and other scientific equipment, but it is impossible for one to . say what amount of this is to be expended in any particular State. I raise these points now because Senator Ashley mentioned the matter, and I thought that the Leader of the Senate might, in his reply, deal with them, and so save time when the bill is in committee. An examination of the schedule would suggest that New South Wales and Victoria are not doing so badly, for 'I notice that £320,000 is to be expended in connexion with the explosives factory at Maribyrnong, £200,000 at the ammunition factory at Footscray, £300,000 at the ordnance factory, Maribyrnong, and £150,000 at the small arms factory, Lithgow, also £'275,000 is set down for construction work at Cockatoo Island. Having in mind the importance of those establishments, I do not suggest that a disproportionate amount of the money available is to be expended in the States in which they are situated; but I rose to point out-I think the matter should be raised now-that if all the States expect to have to pay for the defence of this country, they equally expect to participate in the work created by that expenditure.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It is necessary that the measure should be made law within the next few days, in order that Treasury officials may prepare the prospectus to be issued in connexion with the loan to be raised. One thing that struck me in the debate was that some honorable senators did not view the Government's defence programme in its true perspective. The scheme emanated from the Imperial Conference last year; it has since been under constant examination and has had the most earnest consideration of Cabinet. It is not an isolated defence proposal, but is part of a great effort that is being made by Great Britain and other self-governing dominions for the purpose of assuring world peace. Senator Payne this evening almost touched on this important underlying principle. Its adoption does not mean that the Commonwealth has any desire to encroach upon any other nation's preserves. Failing the effective working of that great instrument for peace-the League of Nations-the only course available to British democratic countries is to cooperate in defence measures in the earnest hope that, in the international sphere, the rule of force shall be replaced by the rule of law. Under existing world conditions democracies, as single units, could not hope to defend themselves. Great as our effort may appear to be to secure the defence of Australia, it would be unavailing without the strength of other British dominions, and particularly the strength of Great Britain. I do not intend to debate with honorable senators opposite whether or not they have a defence policy. The tornado of words with which the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Collings) assaulted us earlier in the afternoon left me quite cold. I endeavoured unsuccessfully to extract from it some idea of what he and his supporters would do to ensure the defence of Australia if the responsibility rested with them. It is true that the honorable gentleman declared that he believed in the defence of Australia, but his statement contained no concrete proposal.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I felt that he breathed the spirit of co-operation. I gathered from an observation made by the Leader of the Opposition this evening, when Senator Brennan was speaking, that his first line of defence had something to do with the Statute of Westminster. What kind of a weapon that would be against some of the projectiles that might be hurled at Australian defences by enemy war vessels I do not know. He also told us that Labour attaches great importance to the strengthening of the Air Force. I do not wish to detain the Senate, but it is advisable that I should place before those honorable senators who honestly believe that an air force may prove to be a determining factor in modern warfare that events in Spain and elsewhere, as well as some experiments carried out by British authorities, do not support their view. Experience in the use of the la.test anti-aircraft weapons proves that it is practically impossible for bombing planes to come below a height of 20,000 feet with safety to themselves. Not long ago I met a very distinguished man engaged in flying overseas, and discussed with him the future of aerial warfare, for I was much concerned about the possibility, in future wars, of aircraft being used as a terrible weapon for the destruction of the civil population. It was then within my knowledge that a few months previously experiments had been carried out in the North Sea by the British naval and air authorities to ascertain whether it would be possible for hostile aircraft from a height of 15,000 feet, to discern and bomb battleships moving within a circumscribed area. I think the aircraft were instructed not to fly below 9,000 or 10,000 feet and I was told that so efficient is the system of laying down smoke screens that not only were the bombing planes unable to hit their objectives, but they actually could not see them. We also know that Japanese war vessels at Shanghai have not suffered material damage from Chinese bombing planes. As there are many excellent pilots in the Chinese air force, one would have thought that it would be extremely dangerous for Japanese warships to anchor in the river off Shanghai; but so far as we have been able to ascertain, they have not suffered a great deal of damage from aircraft. I am informed that the latest type of anti-aircraft gun is fitted with an extraordinary attachment, which renders it so effective that it is unsafe for hostile planes to descend below 20,000 feet, four miles in the air. Honorable senators will also have read in the newspapers that when Nanking was bombed by the Japanese airmen they had to maintain a height of 15,000 feet. Any honorable senators who have flown will realize what that means. 1. myself have flown at only a few thousand feet, but, even at 6,000 feet, the MurrayRiver at Goolwa, where it is a wide expanse of water, appears as a mere trickle. That being so, can any honorable senator imagine that from the height of 20,000 feet aircraft would be able to inflict damage on a moving object which would certainly be no more, and probably less, than a mere, speck? Men with war experience could tell the Senate better than I of these things, but I do say that to rely upon aircraft as a means of defence is to rely upon a weapon which is not effective. There is only one weapon on which we can rely for our defence and that is the Navy.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The young aviator to whom I referred a few moments ago, who is a great exponent of the aerial weapon, when asked by me why he was so strongly in favour of air defence, made the pathetic reply which showed great gallantry-'We must travel as death squads '. I under stand that the machines dive one after another until the target is hit, the pilots knowing full well that not one of them will ever return to his base or his home. What a spectacle for mankind! An attachment to modern anti-aircraft guns, whose projectiles now reach a height of 20,000 feet, sprays the discharge over a tremendous area. Senator. DuncanHughes, who was associated with the artillery during the Great War, knows that in recent years the trajectory and spread of the shells are such that no aircraft coming within their range can possibly escape. I heard Senator Guthrie laud air defence, but I counsel him to bear in mind what I have said. 1 put that to the Senate, not in any party spirit, but because I believe that the hearts and minds of men should be laid bare on this question in order that we may do the best in the difficult circumstances of the world to-day to save ourselves and our kinsfolk in the sister dominions and in the Mother Country itself, because with the British Commonwealth of Nations lies the ultimate salvation of civilization. .","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The honorable senator then went on to deal with unemployment. I remind him that a sensible rider jumps the fence immediately in front of him, and considers the next jump while his horse is moving towards it. Both Senator Duncan-Hughes and Senator Ashley were critical of the provision for the erection of additions to private factory buildings. At this stage it is not proposed to disclose where some of these buildings and certain fittings will be situated. It is sufficient to say that they will remain the property of the Government, to be used as and when required. Another point raised was the allocation of expenditure between the States. The Minister for Defence (Mr. Thorby), who has grappled manfully with an herculean task, has supplied me with the following information:-Works and buildings in Queensland will aggregate £88,000, while maintenance and services in that State will represent another £396,000. The total expenditure in Queensland will be about £484,000. Works and buildings in New South Wales will aggregate £507,000, compared with £438,000 in Victoria, the reason for the smaller sum in the latter State being that more buildings are necessary in New South Wales than in Victoria. For other capital items £954,000 will be expended in New South Wales compared with £1,617,000 in Victoria. Maintenance and services will represent about £3,000,000, and £2,898,000 in New South Wales and Victoria respectively. However, 1 do not propose to discuss the nation's defence programme in terms of States. I am afraid that another honorable senator, to whose speech I listened with interest, is suffering from ' Lithgowitis ', and although I have a great respect for Lithgow, I have a greater regard for the necessities of the situation and the interests of the nation. In South Australia, under £250,000 will be expended, the reason being that that State is the least vulnerable portion of Australia. Western Australia is apparently not so happily situated, for about £500,000 is to be expended in that State. The expenditure in Tasmania is estimated at £183,000. A large amount is provided for the Northern Territory, for reasons which honorable senators will understand. I think that I have answered most of the points raised during the debate. Another opportunity will be afforded me to deal with the subject of oil supplies. At this stage, I can assure honorable senators that every effort is being made to produce oil locally, and also to provide adequate supplies of imported oil.

It is a lower rate than is charged for an all-lines annual ticket over the New South Wales railways alone, the charge there being £170 per annum, not including sleeping berth fees. It is very much lower than any rate that would be quoted for an annual ticket over all the State railways. The interstate railway journeys are faster than they were, and very large sums of money are being expended on rolling-stock, &c., to ensure more comfortable travelling. In the near future, more time will be cut off the journeys between certain of the capitals.
