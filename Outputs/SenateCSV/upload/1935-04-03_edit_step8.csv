P. Conway for compensation, will the Minister for Defence agree to the appointment of three members of this Senate as a committee to inquire into the claim and report back to the Senate as early as possible? I am now in a position to inform the honorable senator that his question was brought to the notice of the Minister for Defence and he advises that, from the departmental point of view, the case of Captain Conway was finalized years ago. His alleged grievances have been inquired into, and his representations replied to in detail time and time again. Captain Conway, however, refuses to be satisfied with the departmental replies, and persists in keeping his case before Parliament and the Defence Department. Since 1928, five Ministers or Assistant Ministers for Defence have investigated the case, and each has arrived at the conclusion that no injustice has been done to Captain Conway. Further, the departmental file has been made available to members of Parliament who have interested themselves on his behalf. The Minister for Defence is satisfied that Captain Conway has been given every consideration, and does not propose to take any further action in the matter. I would remind the honorable senator that an offer was made to him, on the 11th July, 1934, to have the file placed on the table of the Library if he so desired. This offer has not, been availed of, and it is still open.","CAPTAIN T. P. CONWAY","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","33","MCLACHLAN, Alexander","KTR","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Briefly, the purpose of this measure is to enable the bounty on raw cotton to be paid one week earlier than is provided for under existing legislation. Section 9 of the Raw Cotton Bounty Act 1934 provides that bounty shall be payable on raw cotton produced during each week ending on Friday, at a fluctuating rate dependent upon the Liverpool spot price on the Friday of that week. Although this section is in accordance with the Tariff Board's recommendation, it is not by any means a vital part of the new cotton policy, and the Tariff Board mentioned the possibility of some of its suggestions being varied in order to meet the legitimate needs or convenience of the industry. The Cotton Board has pointed out that the Liverpool price on each Friday will not be known in Australia until the next Monday. This means that the despatch to growers of cheques covering market value and bounty for any of the previous week's cotton cannot be started until eight days after the cotton is ginned. This delay of eight days is additional to the average period of a fortnight, under the previous seed cotton bounty, between the grower's consignment of seed cotton to the ginnery and his receipt of a cheque for market value plus bounty. As most growers are dependent upon their cheques for the payment of wages to cottonpickers, which, I understand, is the largest item of production costs, and pickers usually have to await their wages in order to meet storekeepers' accounts, it is thought that a considerable service will be rendered to the industry if the advancement of the date of payment, as proposed in the bill, is approved by Parliament. This measure consists of three clauses, and the necessary amendment is made in clause 3. It is purely a machinery bill.","N/A","RAW COTTON BOUNTY BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[1]/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

A member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly informed me, however, that the cotton growers were distressed, in many cases, because of the action of the Government in allowing certain cotton goods to be imported into Australia, thereby preventing the sale of about 6,000 bales of cotton on the local market.","N/A","RAW COTTON BOUNTY BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Until October, 1932, the minimum age prescribed in the Spirits Act at which whisky could be sold for consumption was two years. During the debate on the tariff schedule in 1931 it was resolved that the period of maturation in respect of Australian whisky should be increased to three years. This amendment of the tariff schedule necessitated an amendment of the Spirits Act, and. in October, 1932, sections 3 and 12 of the act were amended to bring them into line with the excise tariff with respect to the maturation period of Australian whisky, and. as a corollary, section 11 of the act was amended at the same time, so that similar conditions would be applicable to imported whisky. By the passing of act No. 23 of 1933 in November, 1933, the operation of the 1932 act was suspended until the 1st October, 1935. The Tariff Board was asked to report as to the necessity for increasing the maturation period for whisky from two to three years, and the conclusions of the majority of the board were as follows: - That it has not been established that an extension of the compulsory maturation period from two years to three years is necessary in the interests of public health. That the evidence as to theimprovement in flavour of whisky stored in Australia for three as against two years is not sufficient to justify government action to ensure compulsory maturation of whisky for a longer period than two years.

The Tariff Board has, however, stated that no convincing evidence was submitted at the inquiry to establish that considerations of public health called for an extension of the two year period. In the trade, opinions are divided as to the necessity for a longer period of maturation than two years. The interests supporting the longer period claim that whisky improves in quality during the third and subsequent years of maturation, and that the cost of storage per gallon is low. Whilst the importance of quality is recognized, the object of the maturation provisions of the act is not the fixing of a standard of quality but the safeguarding of public health by ensuring that no spirit shall be sold for consumption until it has been matured sufficiently to make it fit for human consumption. The evidence available indicates that a period of two years is sufficient to achieve that object. If, as stated, the cost of storage is low, and the quality improves with a longer period of maturity, the enhanced quality of the product should be sufficient inducement for distillers to mature their spirit for a longer period than two years. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Spirits Act to provide for a reversion to the period of maturation for whisky which was in force from 1908-31, a period of 22 years.","N/A","SPIRITS BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[1]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In the interests of public health, I think that a period of three years is short enough. But, after all, we may safely leave it to those who drink whisky to safeguard their own interests. If whisky were offered for sale in bottles whose labels indicated that their contents had been matured for four months, or even for seven months, not many whisky drinkers would touch it. I know that I would not. For that reason, I am of the opinion that the public will safeguard itself in this matter. Nevertheless, I should like to know the reason for the proposed alteration of the maturation period. Is some firm in such financial straits that it cannot hold on for another year unless the period of maturation is reduced from three years to two years, thereby enabling it to 'dispose of its product? Some years ago I visited a distillery and was amazed at the quantity of spirit in storage there. It seemed to me that sufficient spirit was on hand to fill a building as large as Parliament House, and I thought that that one distillery contained sufficient whisky to supply the world for the next 50 years. Surely all that spirit has not gone into consumption! There must be large quantities of whisky still available, and, therefore, I cannot understand the reason for the introduction of this measure. I feel somewhat concerned about the reduction of the period of maturation to two years, because I know enough about spirits not to drink whisky which has been matured for only two years. I say to my innocent friends in this chamber that they would be well advised not to drink whisky which is only two years old. Whatever the age of whisky, there are some persons who would be better off if they drank less of it; on the other band, there are some who would be improved by an occasional drink. The Minister has not put forward any sound reason for the change.","N/A","SPIRITS BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I recently read in a book by Sir Walter Scott, a toast which it might not be inappropriate to mention when discussing a bill dealing with the maturation period of whisky.

I suggest to him and the Senate that no overseas whisky less than three years old isimported to this country. If any honorable senator cares to visit the bar at Parliament House, and examine the labels of the whisky bottles on the shelves there,. he will find that each proclaims the contents to be ' matured old whisky '. The Minister, whilst my leader was speaking, interjected to the effect that from 1908 to 1921, the regulations under the Spirits Act provided for a maturation period of two years. He did not, however, say what was the quantity of whisky produced in Australia during that period. The figures for the years 1921 to 1934 show that the Australian distilleries have made great inroads into the trade of importers ofoverseas whisky. The Minister admitted that there was a difference of opinion in the trade as to whether the period should be two years or three years. During the regime of the Scullin Government, the period was fixed at three years, and the Australian industry was firmly established under that arrangement. Now some one comes along and suggests that the period should be reduced to two years. I happen to know something about the agitation which took place a few years ago as to the period of maturation, and I recall that only one firm at that time desired the period to be fixed at two years. The other firm, which had become well established, and was an important competitor of overseas whisky firms, desired the period to he fixed at three years. I should like the Minister to tell the Senate definitely whether the section which now desires the maturation period to be two years is the smaller or the larger section of the Australian industry. Personally, I do not know whether whisky can mature in two years or three years, because I do not drink it; but I do know that some years ago a complete investigation was made into the question, and, as a result, the Scullin Government fixed the period at three years.","N/A","SPIRITS BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The period of maturation is a vexed question. The argument now is that as evaporation is more pronounced in Australia than in Scotland, the home of good whisky, the period of maturation may be reduced from three years to two years. This seems a plausible argument, but there is a wealth of evidence on both sides, and as this is a highly technical subject, it is difficult for the layman to thoroughly understand it in all its aspects. When I was privileged to visit Scotland after the war, like Senator Barnes I visited some of the best known Scottish distilleries and saw there vast quantities of spirit in varying stages of maturation. Some of the whisky, I was informed, had been laid down during the reign of King Edward VII., and I must confess that. I never tasted anything more satisfying and. agreeable in my life. That mellow whisky fully confirmed all that I had heard about the gustatory properties of this wonderful beverage. I, therefore, feel sure that all this talk about whisky reaching full maturity in two or three years, and that it does not improve after that period, is sheer nonsense. In the light of my personal experiences in Scotland, where people have been making whisky for countless generations, the argument that whisky can be fully matured in the wood in two years is absolute tosh. The suggestion that the agitation for a minimum period of three years is part of a sinister scheme on the part of the large Scottish distilleries to crush Australian makers of whisky does not sound right to me, because we may be quite sure that Scottish whisky manufacturers would not put an immature whisky on the market. They have to think of their reputation as the makers of the finest whisky in the world.","N/A","SPIRITS BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[4]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Most of his statements, so far as I can see, were quite antagonistic to those put forward by chemists and others connected with the distilling business, whose contention and experiments would go to show that the longer a whisky is kept in the wood the more palatable, smooth and mellow it becomes. In 1915, the period of maturation in Great Britain was fixed at three years, upon the unanimous recommendation of a whisky committee that was set up, and after it had heard evidence from all theparties engaged in the industry there. Et would bc a retrograde step, I think, to make the period of maturation in Australia two years, and at the committee stage I shall move for the insertion of an amendment with regard to imported whisky. When the period was increased in Great Britain, the great distilling firms of Scotland were able to induce other countries to extend their periods. The list showing the maturation times in various countries is a very interesting one. A five years' period is provided in Norway, the Irish Free State and New Zealand. The increased period will begin to operate in New Zealand on the 1st May next. In the United States of America, the period is four years, and a three years' period is observed in Great Britain, the Union of South Africa, theBahama Islands, Bermuda, Ceylon, Denmark, Ecuador, Fiji Islands, Gambier, Gold Coast Colony, Hong Kong, Kenya, New Hebrides, Papua, Peru, and the Philippine Islands. I point out that New Zealand has decided only recently to increase the period of maturation from three to five years. The policy adopted in the House of Representatives in 1931, to which Senator Daly alluded, was in line with that followed in other parts of the Empire, and I regard it as sound. It is in conformity with that laid down by the Whisky Association of Great Britain, which comprises the whole of the distilling interests of England, Scotland and Ireland. Having read the bill, and having listened to the speech by the Minister, it seems to me that the measure seeks to apply the same maturation period to imported as to Australian whisky. The original act extended the period for imported whisky from two to three years as from the 1st October, 1935. The Tariff Board, in its majority report, dealt entirely with the maturation of Australian whisky, and I do not believe that the board has been concerned at all about the imported article.","N/A","SPIRITS BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[4]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Further, after listening to the evidence of numerous witnesses, the Tariff Board, although not quite unanimous, has definitely decided that an extension of the maturation period is not required for health reasons. I support, the bill. I take precisely the same view that.

I have read- the scientific evidence presented to the Tariff Board and want to dispel from the minds of honorable senators any doubt as to whether an extension of the maturation period would have a beneficial effect on the health of consumers. It has been demonstrated beyond measure by. chemists that maturity is reached in two years, and that also is shown by the fact that for 26 years the prescribed period for maturation in Australia remained at two years. The maturation period in Scotland is three years. The period we now propose to provide for maturation in Australia is two years. But technical evidence, as submitted to the Tariff Board, shows that, comparing South Australia with New Zealand, evaporation takes place in the proportion of 44 to 33, in other words, evaporation takes place at a much higher rate in Adelaide. The suggestion that we are going back on something that has been the settled policy of this country is utterly unfounded.

The country which is most favoured in regard to evaporation has the advantage of faster maturation - in this respect Australia hass a big advantage over Scotland. There are three kinds of maturation, viz., compulsory maturation to remove deleterious substances, trade maturation to improve taste or flavour, and maturation of wine. Under ordinary conditions of storage evaporation in Adelaide approximates four times that of Edinburgh. Maturation must, of necessity, be faster in Adelaide than in Scotland, oxidation and concentration must be faster, and flavour must be made or marred at a faster rate.","N/A","SPIRITS BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[6]/quote[2]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

On the other hand, the evidence was overwhelming that such substances as are deleterious to health, and are found in twoyearold whisky, do not decrease with age. In fact, the more harmful substances of furfurol and fusel oil tend to increase in percentage as whisky is stored. In making this point no inference is intended that the public health is endangered by the increase - the proportions of furfurol and fusel oil are very small. A royal commission on whisky and other potable spirits, held in Great Britain in 1908-9, stated : - ' In our opinion, the compulsory bonding of spirits for a prescribed length of time could only be justified if it were established that such restriction of trade is necessary in the interests of public health '. After shortly reviewing the evidence available, the commission concluded that it was ' not desirable to require a minimum period during which spirits should be matured in bond '.

I admit that there is a diversity of opinion on that subject. Three members of the Tariff Board said that their considered opinion was that whisky made in Australia did not improve if kept three years instead of two years, but the Minister says that an entirely different state of affairs exists in regard to imported spirits. Maturation is the result of evaporation, and it is stated that evaporation is four times as great in Australia as in Scotland. On that basis, it is necessary for whisky made overseas to be of greater age than whisky made here, if the quality is to he approximately the same. The legislature of New Zealand recently altered the period of maturation for all spirits consumed in that dominion to a minimum of five years. That was done at the request of the Whisky Association, a body which represents not only the ' group ' companies, but also every distillery of any consequence in England, Ireland and Scotland. Seeing that the five-year period was fixed at the request of the Whisky Association, the overseas distillers have no ground for complaint. No question of immature spirits coining from Britain arises, because the distillers there are so jealous of their reputation that they will not allow immature whisky to leave their distilleries. I think that a period of five years is reasonable in the case of imported spirits.","N/A","SPIRITS BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Except where specific provision has been made in trade agreements with other British dominions, or in relation to certain products of the British non-self-governing colonies, existing customs and tariff legislation specifically limits the British preferential rates of duty to goods produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are administered under their own laws. For customs purposes they have not been regarded as part of the United Kingdom. In consequence goods imported into the Commonwealth from those islands are legally dutiable at the rates prescribed under the general tariff. The tariffs of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands follow the lines of the tariff of the United Kingdom. Following the introduction of preferential duties by the United Kingdom, as a result of the Ottawa agreement, the islands introduced preferential tariffs, which extend to Empire countries preferential duties almost identical with those granted by the United Kingdom. Since January, 1933, Australia, along with other British countries, has participated in these preferences, which cover many of our principal export commodities. In addition, the Guernsey administration is prepared to recommend the local Parliament to grant a 50 per cent. preference on Empire wines. Imports into Australia from the islands have in the past been limited to small consignments received at irregular intervals. Until two small consignments reached Australia recently no imports had been recorded since 1929. As the islands have gratuitously extended their preferential tariffs to Australia, it is desired to reciprocate. This can be done most conveniently by including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands within the meaning of the expression 'the United Kingdom.' The retrospective application of the amendment will enable the British preferential rates to be applied to the two small shipments which recently reached Australia.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","174","BRENNAN, Thomas","K2Z","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","This bill, as honorable senators are no doubt aware, deals with two entirely different aspects of navigation. The first part, clause 3, has reference to section 7 of the Navigation Act which defines what vessels are deemed to be engaged in the coasting trade. It is proposed to amend this section to permit British overseas vessels of a stipulated tonnage and speed, under certain conditions, to carry passengers coastwise between ports not connected by rail. By the second part of the bill, clause 4, it is proposed to' amend section 231 of the Navigation Act, so that small vessels, trading interstate, and not at present required by the existing law to carry a wireless installation, will be required to be so equipped. Regarding clause 3, let me say at the outset that the amendment proposed in it is designed to afford to Tasmania some relief from the pressure of the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act. As honorable senators are all aware, one of the grievances of Tasmania is that the protection afforded by Commonwealth legislation to Australian shipping, by what are known as the coasting trade sections of the Navigation Act, has resulted in serious injury to what was, in times past, a valuable source of revenue, namely, the tourist traffic from the mainland to Hobart. Before the war there was no restriction on overseas vessels carrying passengers and cargo between Australian ports. Not much was done in this way, it is true, but from this little, Hobart probably received the most advantage. Every year, in the apple season, big liners made a detour from Sydney to Hobart on their homeward voyages to pick up a cargo of fruit at that port, whence they proceeded to Melbourne to resume their ordinary itineraries. Many tourists, with money to spend, made each year what was known as the ' apple trip,' that is, they embarked on the overseas steamer at Brisbane or Sydney, proceeded to Hobart and, after a break of journey there, proceeded in some following vessel to Melbourne, whence they returned home either by some incoming overseas liner or by rail or coasting steamer. Other passengers, again, restricted themselves to day excursions while the vessel loaded at Hobart, and were carried on in her to Melbourne without a break of journey. In one way and another these tourists circulated a good deal of money in Tasmania. These calls of overseas ships at Hobart for fruit were suspended during the war, and before they were fully resumed and things again became normal the Navigation Act was brought into force, in July, 1921. That ended, for the time being at any rate, the ' apple trips ', not because of any express provision in the act, but by reason of the way in which the protective sections worked out in practice. Subject to certain exemptions and permits that may be, and have been, granted, and to which I shall shortly refer, the Navigation Act prohibits the carriage of passengers coastwise between Australian ports by ships other than those duly licensed to engage in the coasting trade. All ships, British and foreign, locallyowned and overseas, are in one sense on a footing of equality in the matter of obtaining licences. The conditions attached to the grant of the licence - chiefly in respect of compliance with award rates of wages and hours of work, and the Navigation Act requirements as to manning scales and accommodation for crew - are, however, such that in actual practice the local vessels only have complied and become licensed. Overseas owners decided that it would not pay them to adopt these conditions for the short time the ships would be trading on the coast. However, this may have been, the practical result was that the apple boats carried no more tourists to Hobart. Whether due to this cause alone, or, as is more probable, to the post-war depression conditions, the number of visitors to Hobart greatly decreased. The people of Hobart attributed the falling away almost wholly to theoperations of the Navigation Act. They pointed out that the one licensed ship running between Sydney and Hobart compared most unfavorably with the large overseas liners, and was in point of size, speed and appointments, neither attractive to tourists nor adequate to accommodate the numbers which previously travelled.","N/A","NAVIGATION BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In 1926, to meet, as far as was then thought possible, the demand for readmittance of the overseas liners into the tourist trade, the Navigation Act was amended by the insertion in section 286 of the following provision : - (6.) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Governor-General that the tourist traffic between any ports in the Commonwealth or in the territories under the authority of the Commonwealth is being injured or retarded, and the Governor-General is satisfied that it is desirable that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage in the trade, he may, by notice published in the Gazette, grant permission to unlicensed British ships of such size and speed as are specified in the notice to engage in the carriage of passengers between those ports subject to such conditions (if any) and for such period as is set out in the notice. Under this new provision, orders in council were issued, for several successsive years, permitting British ships of not less than 10,000 tons gross register, and a speed of fifteen knots - subsequently reduced to fourteen knots - to carry passengers to and from Hobart during the tourist season, without bringing themselves within the scope of the coasting trade provisions of the act. For some reason of their own, however, the overseas lines declined to avail themselves of the concession, and it was not until December, 1932, that, by agreement among themselves, the companies concerned commenced booking tourists for the Hobart run. There was an immediate response by the public and during that summer season some 4,000 passengers were taken from the mainland ports of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne to Hobart by the overseas ships alone. For the next following tourist season, ended on the 31st May last, the number of passengers carried to Hobart from the mainland, by overseas vessels, under the exemption, was approximately 3,500. For the current tourist season, the position so far is satisfactory, although it is not expected that the number of passengers carried to Tasmania by the overseas vessels will equal that of either of the two previous seasons. A very interesting feature of this revival of tourist traffic is that, contrary to the anticipations of the owners of local steamers, the passenger traffic by the licensed vessels has actually increased since the overseas British ships came into the trade, under the exemptions. It is worthy of note, too, that the number of passengers travelling from Tasmania to the mainland ports of Sydney and Melbourne by licensed steamers is considerably greater than the numbers sailing by licensed vessels from those ports. Here are the figures showing the traffic by the Australian-owned licensed ships during 1931-32, when the overseas vessels did not engage in the tourist traffic, and for the two following seasons, when they did- These figures show conclusively that the local licensed ships were not injured by the participation in the tourist traffic by the overseas liners, but were actually benefited by it. Two things are clear. In the first place, as compared with 1931-32, when the overseas boats did not carry tourists, there was, in 1932-33, an increase of 3,561 and in the following season an increase of no les? than 14,917, or 27 per cent., in the number of passengers carried both ways by the Australian-owned licensed ships. Secondly - and this is a very significant point - during both the seasons in which the overseas ships carried tourists, the local ships conveyed back to the mainland ports more passengers than they had taken over to Tasmania. The excesses in the two seasons were, in round figures, 1,500 in the first season, and 3,700 in the latter. The explanation is, of course, that tourists taken in overseas ships to Hobart stayed there for a holiday, returning later to their homes by local liners. This is a condition likely to continue, and it is confidently believed, therefore, that the exemption of overseas liners in respect of the tourist traffic provided in the bill will be of considerable and lasting advantage to the Australian shipping industry. In assessing the value to Tasmania of these exemptions to overseas liners it is necessary to remember also that a new travel feature, adverse to the Tasmanian interests, has been developed during recent years in the form of cruises from Australian ports by. some of the largest and latest of the overseas liners to New Zealand, Noumea, Norfolk Island, Suva, Papua and New Guinea, all of which, having the element of novelty, are strongly competitive with the Tasmanian tourist business. Tasmania has undoubtedly done remarkably well, not only to hold the traffic, but actually to increase it, as she has done, in the face of such competition. That she has been able to do so is directly due, without doubt, to the exemptions granted. The fact that it is now possible to visit the State in fast and commodious liners contributes greatly to the attractiveness of the trip, and, so long as facilities to do so are ensured, there is every reason to hope for a progressively increasing tourist business. But the people of Tasmania, realizing, as they do, the benefits which have accrued from the operation of the exemptions, are desirous that the concession, granted at present by executive act only from season to season, should not depend upon the policy of the administration of the day, but should be given a statutory basis so that it could be withdrawn only by specific amendment of the Navigation Act, agreed to by Parliament. In order, too, that Tasmanian interests may be encouraged to improve and develop the attractions of the island, including its hotel and other accommodation, it is essential, it is contended, that there shall be some guarantee of not only adequate, but also permanent and attractive, shipping facilities for their visitors. Business people cannot be expected to go to heavy expense in improving accommodation, nor the State Government to spend money in the provision of roads to the scenic beauties of the State, unless there is some assurance of an adequate return, necessarily spread over a lengthy period. Successive governments, during the thirteen years the Navigation Act has been in operation, have considered the question of giving relief. The difficulty in the way, however, lies in section 99 of the Constitution, which provides -","N/A","NAVIGATION BILL 1935","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","177","BRENNAN, Thomas","K2Z","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","With a view to overcoming this difficulty proposals have been made from time to time for amendments of the act which, it was suggested, would have the effect, without violating section 99, of exempting the passenger traffic between Tasmania and the mainland ports from the coasting trade provisions of the act. On each occasion, however, the legal advice supplied to the Government has been that, as the condition, whatever it may have been, laid down in each case as precedent to exemption, was clearly applicable only to communication between ports in Tasmania, on the one hand, and those of the other States, on the other, and excluded traffic between any two mainland ports or States, the proposed provision could not but be regarded as infringing section 99. Further consideration has recently been given to the matter, with a view to ascertaining whether the constitutional difficulty could be overcome by some provision, of wider scope, which, while affording to Tasmania the relief desired, would, at the same time, by reason of its more general application, benefit other similarly isolated parts of the Common- wealth, and thus be free from any possible objection of discrimination or preference in favour of a single State. ' The present bill is the result. By the amendment of section 7 of the principal act, as proposed, it is hoped not only to remove the disabilities that have injured the tourist traffic to Hobart and retarded its development, but also to confer corresponding advantages as regards passenger traffic on. the outlying portions of the Commonwealth similarly cut off from the ordinary means of land communication with the more populated parts. This objective, it is believed, can be achieved without infringement of the Constitution. In this connexion, it is worthy of note that constitutional authorities, in considering the real import of the words 'give preference', as they appear in section 99, have expressed the view that, in deciding what is and what is not a preference, section 99 should be construed liberally, with especial reference to the evil which it is intended to prevent, namely, arbitrary and prejudicial discriminations between States or localities, and that, in determining what constitutes equality of treatment, recognition should be given to the practical necessities of the case. In this view, if the difference of incidence grows out of the' dissimilarity of circumstances of one State or locality as compared with another, or if it is based on recognized and reasonable principles of administration, it is not a ' preference ' within the Constitution. The view of the Government and its advisers is that the present bill .is not open to any suggestion of preference to any one State or part thereof. It covers any two ports in the Commonwealth ' not connected by rail '. Thus, in addition to permitting the carriage, by British ships of the class specified, of passengers from any Tasmanian port to the mainland and vice verm, travel by them would also be permissible between any mainland or Tasmanian port and any other such place wholly dependent on sea communication, such as Kingscote, on Kangaroo Island, and Lord Howe Island, which is a portion of New South Wales. The exemption would have application also to travel between mainland ports in the northern parts of the continent. The northern railhead in Western Australia is at Geraldton, and in Queensland, at Cairns. Between these ports there are some 2,700 miles of coastline with ports which have no rail connexion with any other ports in Australia. Under the proposed amendment, therefore, passengers might also be carried without restrictions between and to and from any ports in that area by any unlicensed British ships of the stipulated tonnage and speed, such, for example, as the new Blue Star liners, now being placed in the chilled beef trade between Australia and the United Kingdom, via Torres Strait. With respect to the ports along the coast mentioned, between Geraldton and Cairns, namely, the north-west ports of Western Australia, Darwin, and Thursday Island, travel to and fromthese places by unlicensed British ships is already allowed - so far as Darwin is concerned, under exemption, and, as regards the other ports, by means of continuing permits. It may bo objected, and it is admitted that it would be theoretically correct, that the proposed amendment would make it possible for unlicensed ships to compete in the passenger trade between Melbourne and the northern ports of Tasmania, already well catered for by local licensed steamers. In actual practice, however, the depth of water in the Tamar restricts the shipping to Launceston to relatively shallow-draught vessels. Overseas vessels call at the lower Tamar ports - Beauty Point and Bell Bay - or at Burnie, in the north-west, at very infrequent intervals. The large passenger liners never do so, and the number of passengers carried by the cargo steamers calling, if any, would never amount to more than a score or so, at most, in a year. It may be objected that the proposed amendment would permit vessels of the Eastern and Australia line, the Nellore, Tanda, and Nankin, which are manned by coloured labour, and which call at Hobart at monthly intervals, to enter into unfair competition between Hobart and Sydney with the licensed vessel Zealandia. There is no danger of this, as the vessels in question are of only 7,000 tons gross register, and would accordingly, as being under the 10,000 tons minimum prescribed, be excluded from the exemption. Clause 3 of the bill, as drawn, is considered to be free from constitutional objections; it will afford to Tasmania that guarantee as to tourist shipping facilities which they reasonably seek; it will, as experience has demonstrated, have no adverse effect on local shipping, but will rather benefit it, and it will be the means of improving the facilities for travel along our northern coast-line. The question is, moreover, a non-political one, as all parties are united in a desire to help Tasmania and the settlers in the more distant parts of the continent, more especially where it can be done, as in this case, without injury to local interests. I desire, however, to make it plain, on behalf of the Government, that the amendment proposed by the bill is designed primarily to remedy the disabilities suffered by Tasmania in the matter of her tourist traffic, and if it is found at any time that any considerable abuse is introduced - by such means, for example, as alterations of itineraries for the purpose of bringing ships under the exemption and not for legitimate trade purposes - and that consequently our shipping interests are being injured in respect of their trade between mainland ports, consideration may have to be given to the question of repealing the provision, leaving the matter of the tourist traffic to be dealt with from season to season, as hitherto, by exemption order under section 286. This section is being left in the act, available for the purpose. I turn now to the second part of the bill, clause 4, which relates to the provision of wireless telegraphy apparatus on small ships, that is, on ships not already required by the existing law to be so equipped. The Navigation Act. as it now stands, requires the installation of wireless and the carrying of a certificated operator on the following classes of ships : - Passenger ships, i.e., ships carrying more than twelve passengers, irrespective of tonnage; and other ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards. In recent years, several small cargo steamers under 1,600 tons, and conse- quently not provided with wireless, have disappeared at sea, with a. heavy loss of life. As in most of these cases, the disappearances have occurred in times of storm, the presumption is that the vessels were overwhelmed by the seas and foundered, but, being without wireless, and there being no survivors, no definite information is available as to the actual cause of loss. These vessels were, moreover, not able to send out the distress call asking for assistance. Recent examples are the SS. Christina Fraser, a collier of 716 tons gross, which disappeared off Gabo Island on the 23rd Tune, 1933, and the SS. Coramba, an intra-state trader, running between Melbourne and Port Fairy, which went down in the abnormally heavy weather of the 30th' November last. The disappearance of the vessels was investigated by courts of marine inquiry constituted, in the case of the Christina Fraser, under the Commonwealth Navigation Act, and, in the case of the Coramba, under the Marine Act of Victoria. In each case, the court added to its finding a rider to the effect that, in its opinion, all sea-going vessels should be equipped with wireless apparatus. That public opinion is definitely in favour of such a course is evidenced by the fact that, following on the loss of the Coramba, the Victorian branch of the Seamen's Union announced that its members would refuse to man sea-going vessels which did not carry wireless, and the press, almost without exception, gave support to the seamen in the attitude adopted. In December last a regulation was issued under the Navigation Act requiring that, on and after a given date, every sea-going steamship not already required to be equipped with wireless should carry an efficient apparatus of an approved type which, when put in operation, would automatically send out, in the Morse code, wireless signals prescribed to be used for a ship in distress, together with the ship's name and position. Such apparatus did not require the attendance of a skilled operator. This requirement, it may be added, represented the utmost that could be done without an amendment of the Navigation Act. The maritime organizations, representing officers and seamen on coastal vessels, strongly urged, however, that an automatic apparatus was not sufficient, and requested that, in all cases, a qualified wireless operator be carried. The Minister for Health and Repatriation (Mr. Hughes) received deputations from the maritime organizations and the shipowners, and, after conference with both parties, has prepared a scheme which the amendment contained in the bill is designed to implement. The salient points of the scheme are as follows: All steamships engaged in the interstate trade, and not already required to carry wireless, are to be provided with a wireless telegraph installation having the same range, namely, 100 miles, as the standard installation on the larger ships. The installation, however, is to be of a modified and cheaper type. For apparatus the use of which is restricted to distress signals and communications consequent thereon, the cost of each installation to the owners will, it is understood, be in the neighbourhood of £91 per annum. Where provision is made for the sending of other messages, the cost will be up to about £125 per annum. The costs mentioned cover both rental and maintenance. In the case of vessels of 750 to 1,600 tons gross, the installation is to be in charge of a. certificated wireless operator, whilst on vessels of under 750 tons gross, it will be attended to by an officer or member of the crew holding a ' limited ' certificate as ' wireless signaller ', issued by the Postmaster-General's Department. The wireless signaller, who will be the mate or a member of the crew, will be qualified both to send and receive by Morse on the installation. In cases where a wireless signaller is carried, an automatic distress sender of an approved type, capable of automatically sending out, in the Morse code, wireless signals prescribed to be used for a ship in distress, together with the ship's name and position, is to form part of the installation. In cases where it is found impracticable to accommodate an operator on an existing vessel of between 750 and 1,600 tons gross, power will be given to exempt the vessel from the requirements to carry an operator, and to permit, in lieu, the carrying of a wireless signaller. Before, however, any ship is so exempted from the carrying of an operator, it is proposed that the Minister shall refer the matter to a committee of advice of three persons appointed under the Navigation Act, to investigate and make a recommendation. Such a committee of advice will consist of the Director, or Deputy Director, of Navigation, who will be chairman, a representative of the ship-owner, and a representative of the maritime organizations. Power will be given for the exemption of a ship while in tow of another vessel fitted with wireless, or trading between ports not more than 25 miles apart, or proceeding on a single voyage. The owners of certain vessels on the coast, which are not now required to carry wireless, have voluntarily provided installations on their vessels. Certain steamers, running between Melbourne and Brisbane, form an example. Each has a wireless installation; but, instead of an operator, an additional mate, a third mate, who attends to the wireless, is carried. In such cases, where it can be shown that the wireless installation satisfactorily fulfils the safety requirements, it will be regarded as acceptable. The provisions outlined will not apply to ships trading on the river Murray, or, for the present, at any rate, to small sailing vessels. There is considerable doubt, it may be explained, as to whether wireless could be efficiently applied to small sailing vessels, where, among other disadvantages, the aerial would be very short and of little height above the water. Commonwealth law, it will be realized, can cover only such ships as are engaged in interstate or overseas trade. Consequently, it can have no application to the great majority of the small ships trading on the coast,, which, being intrastate traders, are subject to State law. A communication has, therefore, been addressed to the Premiers of all the States urging that, in respect of vessels which come within their respective jurisdictions, a scheme not less efficient than that which I have described should be adopted, and, in the interests of safety of life at sea, given legislative effect as early as possible. In several of the States the local authorities are awaiting the passage of this bill in order that the federal requirements may be known. There is reason to believe that most, if not all, of the States will then take action to impose similar requirements on the shipping coming under their control. I ask honorable senators to facilitate the passage of the bill, so that the Tasmanian interests concerned may be encouraged, by an assurance of some degree of permanency of the exemption, to undertake additions and improvements to the existing facilities for tourists. There is nothing contentious whatever in clause 4. The amendment contained in that clause, as I have already indicated, has the support of all sections of the community.Whilst it is impossible to say whether or not any of the crew of either the Coramba or the Christina Fraser could have been saved if those vessels had carried wireless, there can be no question that the use of wireless has greatly reduced the hazards of seafaring life. In the interests of our seamen, and of safety of life at sea generally, I hope honorable senators will co-operate in ensuring the speedy passage of the bill. Until this bill becomes law, there will be no power to require the owners of the small ships concerned to install wireless' on their vessels. Even after the bill has been passed by Parliament, the manufacturers of wireless installations will require, I am informed, about twelve weeks in which to provide and install the necessary equipment. Naturally ship-owners will not order wireless equipment of the type required, nor will manufacturers build it, until they are satisfied that the bill will become law.

Very shortly I am to go into compulsory retirement; but, whichever way we go it is probable that we shall meet again as we pass down the road of life and be able to greet each other with all the cordiality that has marked our long association. Senator Reid has spent many years in the service of his country and, judging from his present appearance, it will be a very long while before he receives the call to cross the River. For many years he was prominent in the industrial life of Australia. In the course of time our views may have differed; but when it comes to a show down no bitterness exists. I hope the honorable senator will spend a pleasant and happy retirement. I find myself in complete accord with the views expressed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir George Pearce) and the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Barnes) concerning Senator Reid. It has been said by an Australian poet that ' All the joy goes out of life as old friends go'. While that aphorism may not be applicable literally to the present occasion, it expresses the pangs which we experience in parting with an old, valued and tried friend. My personal acquaintance with Senator Reid extends over a period of 30 years. The starting point of his activities in public life goes back much further than that - so much further that it is almost lost in the twilight of memory. From the very first he has always been in the firing line, and his record is one that quite a number of his present-day confreres as well as the generations that will follow will always applaud and envy. I recall an incident that occurred some years ago in Queensland which illustrates the independent spirit that has always marked the honorable senator's public service. It was really refreshing. A train in which we were travelling drew up at a crowded country platform, and a poor country man tried, as many might do, to enter a carriage which had been reserved by the Queensland Government for a party of which Senator Reid and I were members. The honorable senator, with native independence, brushed aside all formalities, despite the presence of a large number of his constituents, expostulated with the man, and told him in no uncertain terms that he had no right to enter that carriage. I mention that incident merely to show the magnificent spirit of independence which the honorable senator possesses. He did not go out. of his way to treat that man as other than an ordinary person; he spoke simply as one citizen would speak to another. That incident, which I shall never forget, is an illustration of what, in my opinion, should be the relationship between public men on the one hand and electors on the other. The fact that he acted as he did speaks volumes not only for the honorable senator, but also for the electors of Queensland who have returned him as a member of the Senate for so many years. The honorable senator is a man of high character, and a much appreciated citizen of Queensland. His is an honoured name. We regret his retirement, but trust that he will long be spared to enjoy the fruits of a well spent public life.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It is pleasing to have the good wishes of the Senate, and to hear the appreciative remarks made concerning my public life. I have had a long and fairly strenuous public life, but I am glad to say that I am still in good health and that my retirement is not duo to considerations of health. I trust that I shall live long enough to be able still further to work in the interests of the State of Queensland and Australia generally. If there is work for me to do I shall always be willing to devote my energies to it. In many respects it is with regret that I am retiring from the Senate; but there comes to every man a time when he must determine what is the wisest course to pursue. I feel that it is wise to retire while I am in good health so that I may enjoy in my leisure what life has to offer.
