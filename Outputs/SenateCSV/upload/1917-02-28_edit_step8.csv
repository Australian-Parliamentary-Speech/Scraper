' The present Labour movement is not worth following.' The Hansard reporters are so almost invariably accurate that I am loath to believe that they made a mistake. Yet I do not think that I made the statement in those words. That contention is borne out by a subsequent interjection by Senator Senior, who remarked, ' There is a distinction between the Labour movement and the organization, if you please.' I wish to explain that, so far as the Labour movement is concerned, if I made that statement, I made it entirely in error. I believe that the Labour movement is the hope of the world. The good legislation which Senator Gardiner referred to in his speech as having been passed through 'this Parliament by the Labour party emanated from the real Labour movement, and I hope that I shall never live long enough to say that the Labour movement is not worth following. My interjection was directed against the so-called Labour party; the party which to-day claims that it represents the Labour movement; the party which is represented in the Senate; the party which is controlling the outside organizations. On that occasion I wanted to say that the Labour party at the present time is not worth following. The Labour movement stands for right and for justice. The party calling itself the Labour party in the Senate and outside does not represent the Labour movement; it does not represent justice.

Looking at the business-paper to-day, I se© a reference to another Ministerial statement which followed upon the formation of the second Hughes Government. It covered a new policy, but disclosed nothing definite in regard to. the successful prosecution of the war. That statement was discussed to some extent, but the debate upon it was not concluded, and while it remains on the business-paper a new Ministerial statement is brought forth for the consideration of honorable senators. It is announced that the new combination is a War Government. Honorable senators and the people generally would like to know whether there is any departure in this so-called policy of the new Administration - apart from the ordinary platitudes which have emanated from Mr. Hughes and his followers in recent times - in the methods proposed for the successful prosecution of the war. Are we to assume that things are to go on as they have gone on ever since Mr. Hughes broke away from the Labour party? Is the war with Germany to be still a war of extermination? Mr. Hughes , after about two years of recrimination -and fulmination concerning what he termed the German cancer, and everything attached to Germanism, now calmly admits that he has no objection to anything German except the German military system. That is just what our party said during the conscription conspiracy. We declared that we were opposed to the militarism which the conscription conspiracy attempted to inflict upon a free and democratic Australia. Mr. Hughes , as I have said, now retracts his statement, so all his denunciations during the last two years, here and in London, amount to so many platitudes. Are we to assume that the. policy recently laid down in Great Britain to block the importation of articles of luxury is to be followed in Australia? I sincerely hope so, and I believe this action would have been taken but for the scheming and engineering of Mr. Hughes and his Free Trade colleagues in the Cabinet.

I should think that the Prime Minister is pretty used to the blocking process, judging by his actions during the conscription campaign, when he blocked free speech and the free expression of opinion most effectively. Even on the eve of taking the poll he held back a mail from the Australian soldiers at the front - the Moldavia's mail - until a couple of days after the vote had been taken. That mail should have been delivered before the actual voting day, and we know that when it was delivered many girls in offices and other employment actually cried when, after having voted ' Yes,' they received letters from- their brothers or other relatives at the front urging them, in the name of Australia, in the name of God, and in the name of civilization, to vote ' No.' I say, therefore, that this blocking process will not be any new business to Mr. Hughes; and I am sure the Government will receive the hearty support of this party if that policy, in relation to the importation of articles of luxury, is introduced. To my mind, one of the most lamentable phases of the demonstration in Melbourne on Saturday was the parade of motor cars. The press stated that there were .quite 400 motors in the procession. It is safe to say that fully 90 per cent, of those motor cars had been imported into Australia, and that quite 50 per cent, had come in since the outbreak of war.

It appeared to me that it would have been better if a great deal of the expenditure on Saturday's display had been devoted to the repatriation scheme for our returned soldiers and the alleviation of some of the victims of the evictions - I refer to wives of soldiers at the front. We read in last night's paper that the wife of a soldier in Glebe, in the Prime Minister's own electorate, was evicted because she was a week behind in her rent. We have read also in the Melbourne press that debt collectors are uniformed - they might as well be armed because of the effect of uniforms on women and children - and' that a woman with four young children, all but one of whom are in the hospital with scarlatina, is threatened with eviction because she is behind in her rent. Such actions as these by rapacious landlords are a great deterrent to the recruiting movement. In my opinion the removal of this disgrace - and the checking of the money grabbers in the community - would do more to advance recruiting than the splendid spectacular display we had on Saturday last.

If they do that they will have to ask the people to efface the stigma of th9 ' No ' vote on 28'th October. While that stands it is sheer hypocrisy to talk about ' winning the war.' Voluntarism and ' winning the war ' are proved to be irreconcilable. It is voluntarism and defeat that go hand in hand. The Trades Hall party declares its willingness to support any measures necessary to win the war, provided no attempt is made, directly or indirectly, to introduce conscription. That is to be the attitude of the Senate. As the war cannot be won without men, and as men are not. willing to volunteer, the support it promises is of no value whatever. If the new Government is to be in a real sense a ' win-the-war Government,' it will have to manage without the cooperation of the Senate and its Trades Hall backers, by inducing the people to reverse their unfortunate vote. It is the people who hold1 the key to the situation, and' it is they, and they alone, who can efface the degrading stain that has been put upon the honour of Australia. One of the first acts of the new Government will have to be to provide for representation at the Imperial Conference. Every one admits the urgency and the great importance of that, but unless the representative is able to tell the Conference that Australia is still' prepared to co-operate with the Empire to the fullest extent, what influence can he expect to exercise - what weight will the assembled Ministers be able to attach to his undertakings? The spectre of the vote of 28th October will rise behind his chair, to mock his protestation- that the Commonwealth stands shoulder to shoulder with Britain in the great struggle for free existence. While the Commonwealth is failing to supply reinforcements, and refusing to levy on its manhood to advance the common* cause - while some are not ashamed to say Australia has done enough, and while the organizations which represent a considerable part: of the bone and sinew of the Commonwealth declare undying hatred of the only method of obtaining men which will permit Australia to do her part, representation at this Conference must lose much of its value and effectiveness. That is a pressing reason why the new Government, if it is formed; ought to make a clear and definite statement that the first thing it intends to do is to ask the people to reconsider the reinforcements .referendum question.

We have never presumed to say that we are going to win the war. I only wish that that were so. I only wish that Australia could win the war. If every man available in Australia were at the front to-morrow I have very grave doubts as to whether that would turn the balance in favour of the Allies. I only hope that it would, because if that were the case Great Britain Could get in twenty-four hours more men than would total every eligible man in Australia. If Great Britain took the same step as Australia has taken, :she could get more men in twenty-four hours than remain eligible- in Australia, married and single, and -that is by raising the maximum age to forty-five years. The maximum age in Great Britain now is forty-one years, while in Australia it is forty-five years. That difference would more than compensate for the whole of Australia's eligible men remaining. Those who say that Australia by its efforts could win the war, decide this issue in which millions of men and of wealth are engaged, are in my opinion very optimistic people. Are we ito assume that the policy of the Government is to be followed in pursuance of Sir William Irvine's Dandenong speech, in which he said that no Coalition or alliance worthy of the name could exist until it declared its intention straight out of going bald-headed for conscription? The Government are lacking in honesty, in candour and I should say in backbone in not saying what departures they are going to make in regard to their leader's policy for the prosecution of the war. Are we to assume from the experience of New Zealand, which has brought in conscription, 'that Australia is capable of winning the war by its efforts? The experience of New Zealand has been that, in spite of the introduction of conscription, the Government are not able to keep up reinforcements. I have here a quotation from the Melbourne Herald of the 10th February, which sets 'forth that the Government have had to establish' additional tribunals to hurry up the dealing with the ballots, and to, if possible, rake in the desired number of men for the reinforcements. Subsequently to the publication of that article we now have the information that the Minister for Railways in New Zealand has stated publicly that 25 per cent, of the railway employees have already enlisted, and that no more can be spared. The tribunals, of course,' will not accept that as a legitimate reason for not forcing the men to the other side of the world. They say, 'Stop your excursion trains; stop your race trains; stop all surplus trains.' The Minister for Railways refuses to take that attitude. He points out that if those services, which are nearly always highly payable ventures, are curtailed, the loss of revenue will be great, and, consequently, increased long distance fares will have to be charged, and that this will affect the primary producers in the national work of production in the interests of Great Britain and our Allies. It appears to one reading at a distance that the Minister for Railways takes up a very logical attitude, that to cut down his staff by more than the 25 per cent, already enlisted would not be in the interests of the nation. For two months this collaboration between Mr. Cook and Mr. Hughes has been going on. We have repeatedly read of the negotiations which have been taking place between them, and only the other evening, in the Senate, Senator Pearce stated that at the impending Imperial Conference two of the outstanding matters to be discussed would be war and peace. Quite recently, in reply to Mr. Hampson, the honorable member for Bendigo in another place Senator Pearce made the statement that there had been 19,000 casualties - Australian, I assume - during the month of September. Yet this ' Win-the-War Government' have held over the discussion of the Imperial Conference, which is. to deal with war and peace, for two months. Their troubles if there had been 29,000 casualties, so long as their political jobbing and scrambling had successfully terminated, as it has done! The position is that these twin discredited leaders, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook , both traitors to the Labour movement, called .forth a Fusion.

I said .that Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook were both traitors to the Labour movement. I was speaking in a political sense, and within the scope of legitimate political criticism. Those two gentlemen have brought forth a production which, I submit, was conceived in scheming and engineering. It is now being cradled in deception and distrust between Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook themselves One mistrusts the other. This shuddering mass of political defilement is lying before the people of Australia unclaimed, ' unnamed, and unclothed - lying naked to the stern gaze of the people, who are waiting for an opportunity to deliver their judgment, while the twin authors of this production are trying to cover its political nakedness with a shroud of jingoism. I hold that the people of Australia must have a great disgust for the offspring which is now produced politically Quite another phase of this imposition on the people may be raised by our asking, as was so often asked during the conscription referendum of those who advocated no conscription, both from the platform and through the press, ' What will the Kaiser think of us? What will the Kaiser think of those who vote No? ' It seems to me to be the fashion for honorable senators to speak from the German stand-point. Senator Millen spoke from the stand-point of a German general the other night. It is a pity that we have not Mr. Hughes in this Chamber. He would be in a position to speak as the German Kaiser. He gave some illustrations of his Kaiser-like properties during the referendum campaign. I do not think that there is a member of the Senate who could emulate him or get near him on the indefinable qualities which he then exhibited. We can pass over the doubt, but we may assume that on receipt of the information that this Win-the-war party had been formed, the Kaiser might very reasonably summon a council of war and address Hindenberg, Mackensen and BethmannHollweg probably in these words, 'My children, you can disregard the might of the British Navy; you can still ridicule what we used to term their contemptible army, but what is now an army, under our conscription-Prussian method, of over 5,000,000 men. You can ignore the gallantry of France, the self-sacrifice of our heroic but erstwhile life-long foes. You can despise, if you like, the Italians, You can scorn the Russians and their millions. You can taunt the Japanese and their great growing commercialism. You can look with contempt on Belgium, Servia, Roumania, New Zealand, and South Africa, but danger is upon the Fatherland. That mighty Empire-builder Hughes, and his dear brother, Joseph of the many coloured political coat, have embraced in political unionism.' Surely th© Kaiser might say thai, the partnership between himself and God was on the verge of being rent asunder. There is a constitutional aspect to this Win-the-war Government, and we may be pardoned for making a passing reference to it. On three occasions the Governor-General has given a verdict in face of the opinion which the people of Australia had expressed. I think that the point has been raised, quite correctly and justifiably, that Mr. Hughes was not entitled to receive Supply, that either he misled His Excellency in assuring him that the Government could get Supply, or it was a very dangerous attitude* for His Excellency to have taken up. The Senate demonstrated to the Gover nor-General that Mr. Hughes could not get Supply except with the concurrence of his opponents. When the Labour majority in the Senate decided in its wisdom to cut down the Supply vote: asked for from three months to two, it was a proof to the Governor-General .that Mr. Hughes could not get Supply, and the exercise of the Royal prerogative on. that occasion was strained. The Fusion duly came about, and the Governor-General again apparently accepted the assurance of Mr. Hughes that Supply would! fee forthcoming. Conditions have not altered in the Senate, and it appears to me that there has been a grave departure from that security and safety which should mark the giving and receipt of advice between the Leader of the Government and the Governor-General. We had a very good illustration of that at the time of the double dissolution in 1914. Hardly anybody objected to the granting of the double dissolution on the advice of the Cook Government then in power, but when the Senate, according to the strict letter of the Constitution, requested the Governor-General to submit the referenda questions to the people, his refusal appeared to the lay person to amount to a grave inconsistency. In the statement emanating from the Fusion - a statement entirely devoid of policy - is a reference to the Imperial Conference. Senator Pearce , with what appeared to be a feeble attempt at humour, suggested the other night that perhaps Senator Gardiner would prefer Mr. Anstey, Senator Ferricks, and Senator Mullan as delegates to the Conference in place of Mr. Hughes , Sir John Forrest, and Sir William Irvine. Senator Gardiner said he would, and Senator Pearce replied, ' Very well, we have a clear-cut issue. I would not be afraid to submit that question to the people.' Leaving my name out of the matter, I tell Senator Pearce and Senator Millen that that is just what the people of Australia want in these times. They want a say in choosing those who are going to decide the destinies of Australia. Names certainly should be submitted to them for their selection before men like Mr. Hughes , Sir John Forrest, and Sir William Irvine are allowed to go to the Imperial Conference. Senator Mullan , in spite of Senator Pearce 's attempt at ridicule, has a better right to represent Australia at any Imperial Conference than Sir William Irvine and Sir John Forrest put together, because in addition to his ability and knowledge of Australian matters, he has two sons fighting at the front, and Sir John Forrest and Sir William Irvine between them have neither chick nor child taking part in the affairs of the' world. Senator Mullan also represents a whole State. The people outside are clamouring for a say in the government of their own affairs, and if the names of Mr. Hughes , Sir John Forrest, and Sir William Irvine were put up against any three candidates who might be selected to represent Australian nationalism in a vote to be taken for the whole of Australia, I should not be afraid to be one of those candidates against those three so-called Australians. Senator Pearce was, therefore, attempting to joke on very thin ice. It is idle to assume that men like Mr. Hughes , Sir John Forrest, and Sir William Irvine should go to the Imperial Conference without any indorsement from the people of Australia.

Senator Pearce said also that peace was a very important factor. If he is agreeable to submitting the choice of the Australian delegates to the Conference to the vote of the people of Australia, will he also give them an opportunity of expressing their sentiments on the question raised by Sir Joseph Ward recently in London? ' That self-constituted delegate, speaking in London without any authority from the people of New Zealand, just as Mr.  Hughes spoke without any authority from the people of Australia when he went there on the last occasion, said, ' We must have an Imperial Parliament; Great Britain must submit to an Imperial Parliament, whether she likes it or not.' He added, 'We will fight ' - meaning that Sir Joseph ' Ward will fight - ' for two or three years yet before we agree to any peace terms except the terms satisfactory to us.' Those are not the sentiments of the Australian people, although they have been advocated by men like Mr. Hughes and Sir Joseph Ward, and will be advocated again by Sir John Forrest and Sir William Irvine. There is a grave danger in those men being allowed to go to the Imperial Conference. In the Brisbane Daily Mail of Thursday, 22nd February, appears the following significant paragraph: - , If Sir William Irvine goes to the Imperial Conference - and it is pretty certain that he will - Australia may hear a little more about conscription, and hear of it from a different quarter, too! Things can't go on like this indefinitely. The British people are the gentlest on earth, but even a race of angels won't go on for ever conscripting itself in order to defend a crowd that encourages shirkers and stands up for men who insult the very people that are doing most of the work. There is an insinuation there .that Sir William -Irvine, if he goes to the Conference, will use his best efforts to get the British Government, by Imperial edict, to apply conscription to Australia. It is known that there is at present a deep ar.d widespread feeling regarding the position of Australia and its independence. In the Brisbane Worker of 23id November last was published an extract from a paper called the Western Champion, published at Barcaldine, Western Queensland, one of the semi-official organs of squatocracy and it is known that squatocracy now dominates and dictates to the Fusion Government.

There is already talk of Australia being made into a Crown colony, and everybody probably knows what that means. Britain usually wears, a very soft velvet glove, but shows she wears a steel one underneath when there is occasion. Seems a very fantastic idea, certainly; but there it is .'  There it is, almost in the exact words of the paragraph which I quoted from the* Brisbane Daily Mail of Thursday of last week. The Western Champion, byinnuendo, states that Great Britain would, be quite justified in taking control of Australia. The paragraph from the Brisbane' Daily Mail , coming on top of that, show* the danger of men like Sir William Irvine, who have not and will never have any Australianism in them, being allowed to go to the Conference as delegates from Australia. If Sir William Irvine would agree* to anything like that at the Conference, so would Mr._Hugh.es, after the extremes he went to at the so-called economic Conference at Paris. .If Mr. Hughes , inflated, frog-like by his Imperialism, concluded, that Australia should be. so handled, and; that the people of Australia would tolerate it, he and his co-delegates would not hesitate to commit Australia to any of these ridiculous and disloyal actions. I call them disloyal actions and intentions, because those of us in the Labour party who come in contact with Australianism and Australian feeling generally know what the feeling of the Australian people is. It is not ultra-Imperialist, and the sooner Mr. Hughes and his co-delegates, who are taking it upon themselves to go to the other side of the world to speak for Australia, realize this the better and more loyal subjects will they be to the British Empire, to which they so blatantly proclaim their adherence. The new Fusion, or combination, seeks to ridicule those of us who constitute the majority in opposition in this chamber, and the greatest stigma that they seem able to apply to us is to describe us as the Official Labour party. When we call ourselves the Australian Labourparty, or the Labour party, it seems to please our honorable friends opposite to interject that we are the Official Labour party. Ever since the inception of the Labour movement in Australia, some hard things have been said about the party. and I really expected that when the break came, and those who disagreed with us went their way, thinking they were right, political history would repeat itself in this country, and that we might expect a repetition of some of the epithets hurled at us during the past twenty-five years. The Labour party has been described in the official organs of honorable senators opposite, and by some politicians of the same political colour, as ' ' The uprooters of the Church party,' ' The bursters of the marriage tie,' 'The desecrators of the home,' ' The advocates of free love,' 'Anarchists,' ' Dynamitards,' and ' Syndicalists.' We have lived through all that, and when we are now described merely as ' The Official Labour party,' I am sure that honorable senators opposite, upon consideration, must be surprised at their own moderation.

In view of the terms of vilification applied to the Labour party in the past, the application of the moderate term ' Official ' to the party does not cut any ice or cause meany concern. What I am seriously concerned about is the lack of any policy by the Government. After the fiz-gig launched by Mr. Hughes when he formed his second Cabinet, and after all the negotiations, scheming, and engineering that has since taken place, the people of Australia expected some kind of policy, good or bad, from the present combination Government. I ask any honorable senator on the other side, whether he belongs to the old Conservative faction or the new Fusion faction, to point to anything in the present Ministerial statement that is material. I venture to assert that they must fail to do so. I listened carefully to the statement when it was made by  Senator Millen, and I say that the new Government have lamentably failed to put forward as a policy anything more than the platitudes to which we have become accustomed from Mr. Hughes in recent years. I feel sure that the people of Australia will not be found enthusiastic for the new Fusion, and that when they are given the opportunity it will meet with the same treatment and the same fate as did the Fusion of the Deakin and Cook parties.

Perhaps there is no Parliament in the world in which it is impossible to find men actuated by stronger party feeling, but they saw that party politics were quite out of place during the war. It would have been a good thing if at the beginning of this war we had a Senate like the French Senate, in which the Conservative Royalists crossed the floor, and, shaking hands with the Republican Radicals and Socialists, declared, ' Until this war is ended there is going to be no parties in this Parliament.' They, have carried on in that manner ever since the war began, and have had at the head of the Government one of the most prominent Socialists in France. Why? Not because he was a Socialist, but because he was the strongest man to occupy the position.

I remember the first speecH I made in this chamber after my return from the Old Country. That speech contained nothing to ruffle his feelings or the feelings of any other honorable gentleman opposite, because I had been out of the turmoil due to the referendum campaign, but as soon as I sat down Senator Turley got up and made a personal attack upon me without any justification whatever. He made no straight-out charge, but he attacked me by insinuation and innuendo, and in view of those circumstances I hardly think Senator Turley is entitled to credit for. candour at any time. I repeat that there never was a better chance to heal the breach in the Labour party than when the offer was made to the Tudor section to come into the present Ministry, but they obstinately refused to do anything except indulge in party strife at a time when party strife was entirely out of place. In no other Parliament in the world, except in Australia, do we ' find party strife going on. In no other Parliament in the world do we find members of the Labour party taking up the attitude adopted by those who sit opposite. Their conduct is quite out of harmony with that of Labour members in Europe. What is the position in Great Britain? Who would have 'thought, some three years ago, that a member of the Labour party would to-day be working in harmony as one of the three rulers in the Imperial Parliament, sitting with a Tory on one hand, and a Radical on the other? The attitude of the Labour party in France, Belgium, and elsewhere is not in consonance with the attitude of the party in Australia, where certain individuals seem to glory in the fact that they can keep party bickerings alive. If. however, they think the country is going to stand this ' ' Kilkenny cat business ' ' in politics they will find they are makin? a mistake, and that the people are in no temper to tolerate this condition of affairs. If we do have to appeal to the country, as ' a result of the present debate, the people will know where the Turleys and the Ferricks stand, so far as this war. is concerned. Having outlined briefly v the general policy of the Government, I would like now to say a few words with reference to the speech made by Senator Gardiner , whose remarks prove that he is still labouring under the disadvantage he experienced during his campaign in Western Australia. While he was in the Western State he had to give a rehash of all the legislation that had been passed during the last few years, and referred to the Acts which had been placed upon the statute-book by the united Labour party from 1910 to 1913. One would have thought that he would have had something to say on the present situation. But no. The only thing he did was to hurl across the floor insulting remarks about members being 'rats' and 'renegades.' It would have been much better had he left that out. His other remarks, too, were out of date and unfitted in their application to the present political situation. He referred, among other things, to the Australian Notes Act, the Australian Navy, and the Commonwealth Bank. One would have thought by the manner in which he dealt with those measures that he was entitled, above all other members of the Labour party, to claim credit for them. But did Senator Gardiner do anything out of the way, or, to use a colloquialism, did he make a name for himself in connexion with this legislation? The only thing I know is that he was notorious as the greatest opponent of the Government of that day. I was Whip at that time, and it was my custom to make forecasts as to how a vote was likely to go on any particular division, and make out a list for the then Leader, the late Senator McGregor. I never made the mistake of ever counting on Senator Gardiner as a supporter of the Government. He and Senator Ready had a party all on their own, and that party was the most consistent of all others in opposition to the Government. Senator Millen and those associated with him at that time did not vote more consistently against the Government than Senator Gardiner during the particular period for which he now claims so much credit.

It was quite apparent to any observer that in those days he was the saddest man in the Senate. He was never happy because he could not vote against the Government. It was not until he had thrown off the restrictions and trammels of office, and gone into opposition, that he became himself, the happy man whom we had known in former years. He is a chronic oppositionist, and therefore no one who understands his character can expect him to be happy in a Government. He will far rather go in opposition to a politic hell than go to Heaven with a majority. He will go anywhere so long as he is in opposition. That was his attitude here when the Labour party put on record, I suppose, the finest legislative work which has ever been known in Australian politics.

I am stating, in a general sense, what happened in those times. Senator Grant was not a member of the Senate then, and_, consequently, he cannot be in a position to know whether my remarks are accurate or not. I speak from the experience I gained in the position of Government Whip, which I occupied for a considerable time. It was a notorious fact that Senator Gardiner was a most consistent oppositionist in those times. Whether he was prompted by some quality or temperament which is inherent in him I do not know. I believe that he is only happy when he is in opposition, as he seemed to be a very dull dog indeed while he was a' member of the Ministry. I think it is time that the Commonwealth was given a fair deal. It has not received' a fair deal lately. Things have been done under the cover of party politics by honorable senators sitting on the opposite side which I dare say would not be tolerated in any country in Europe. There are men making political capital out of the present - situation, who, in other countries, would be checked. It is a pity that in a democratic country like Australia a licence should be granted to men to do and say the things which are passing as currency in politics to-day. Members of Parliament ought to realize that that privilege carries with it a certain amount of responsibility. From some of the speeches which have been delivered during the last few months one would think that no war was going on; that everything was proceeding in a normal way. I always admire a man who fights straight out for his party's principles, but any well-wisher of Australia must admit that party politics to-day are quite outside the range of good taste and common sense. We endeavoured to the utmost of our power to come to an understanding with our opponents, but we failed. I have not had very much confidence in any appeal to reason since those attempts failed. I anticipated that our attempts would fail, because of a previous experience of these honorable gentlemen.- At the last Caucus meeting which we attended, these gentlemen expelled the Leader of their party, the Prime Minister of Australia-  ","STATEMENT OF POLICY","COMMONWEALTH WAR MINISTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[29]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The honorable ' senator will not deny, I think, that the Political Labour organization in New South Wales expelled Mr. Hughes for being a conscriptionist. Mr.  Hughes was well within his rights as a Labour man in being a conscriptionist, as I may say he has been ever since I came to know him. I have known Mr. Hughes as a member of this Parliament for the last sixteen years, and I knew him for a good few years previously. Ever since the question of defence was first gone into by the Federal Parliament he has been a believer in the compulsory system, and consequently a believer in conscription. Neither Senator Grant nor any other New South Wales member, so far as I know, has ever questioned the right of Mr. Hughes to be a conscriptionist. What were all the ardent anti-conscriptionists doing in these years that they did not bring the Prime Minister to book as a member of the Labour party? He held these views for a long period, and he was never challenged. These men only plucked up their courage when they were given their orders by the political juntas in Brisbane and Sydney. There was not a syllable of opposition raised to Mr. Hughes when he was elected to the position of Prime Minister. Senator Ferricks - extreme anti-conscriptionist as he is - never once offered a word of objection to Mr. Hughes . Senator Ferricks , Senator Grant , and the rest of them got their instructions from Sydney and Brisbane. They came out of their shell as great anticonscriptionists.

Whether the soldiers are sent to the front in Flanders or anywhere else, they are all fighting at the present time for home defence. If they are not, we have no right to send them there at all. I cannot see any difference between a man defending his country abroad and defending it at home. Wherever the battle has to be fought is the place to fight the country's battles. I was commenting on the sudden volte face of the New South Wales members towards Mr. Hughes . They had not a word to say against him for years and years. They elected him unanimously as Leader of the party, yet they were prepared just as unanimously to throw him out when the Trades Hall gave them their orders. What a sturdy, independent lot they are! Every one of them has a backbone quite as stiff as that of a garden worm. What brave fellows they are! How they slaughtered Mr. Hughes when they got their instructions, but how limp and lam© and obedient they were, and how forgetful they were of their duty to the country on the great question of conscription, when they elected him as their chairman a few months before! That should be sufficient explanation of the 'position we were in when we met at that memorable Caucus, at which a bald motion was moved that Mr. Hughes be expelled. That was moved, practically without any speech, by Mr. Finlayson , of Brisbane. Let me make a comparison between Mr. Finlayson and Mr. Hughes . Mr. Hughes is a life-long trade unionist, the man who, perhaps, with the exception of Mr. Spence, has done more solid work for trade unionism in Australia than the whole of the rest of the representatives of New South Wales. Yet they were ready to expel him on the motion of Mr. Finlayson , of Brisbane. Was Mr. Finlayson ever a member of a trade union? Did he ever vote for a Labour candidate until he voted for himself? I am told on very good authority that he was not a trade unionist and had no connexion with trade unionism until he became a Labour candidate, and that the first Labour vote he cast was for his own nomination. Those are the type of men who were ready to expel and behead Mr. Hughes , the man with a lifelong record to his credit.

What sort of men would we have been, those of us who were conscriptionists. who had. advocated conscription and believed in compulsory training, and had claimed on the public platform credit for placing it on the statute-book, if we had allowed Mr. Hughes to be sacrificed, and had still remained in the party that was doing dirty work of that kind? Even our political opponents would have spat on us- as being unworthy of the name of men. Because we walked out of the room knowing the outrage that was going to be committed on the leader of the party rather than be a party to it, those who were responsible for what was done have ever since been wriggling and twisting in every imaginable way in the attempt to get out of the responsibility for their- action. The difference between expelling Mr. Hughes as leader or expelling him in any other way will not absolve them. We knew what was .about to be done, and rather than be a party to it we walked out of the room.

Senator de Largie has said that, at the Caucus meeting, Mr. Hughes was expelled from the Parliamentary Labour party. When that statement was challenged by interjection, the honorable senator quibble, but admitted that what he had said was wrong.

I had written out my motion previous to going to the meeting. I submitted it and let it take its chance, but I did so without any orders from any Labour organization in my own State. I went into the conscription campaign without orders. It was an open question in Tasmania. The Tasmanian Central Executive decided that everyone might speak for or against conscription without contravening any of the rules of the organization. I took my stand in the campaign as an anti-conscriptionist, and when I came back here I was prepared to see all the differences that had arisen sunk in the interests of the Labour movement as a whole. We know that during the campaign a number of things were said by Mr. Hughes , Senator Pearce, and other conscriptionists that were absolutely unwarranted. They branded anticonscriptionists, who were as loyal and patriotic as themselves as ' pro-Germans,' as persons whose ' ' palms were soiled with German gold,' who were ' backing up the Huns,' and who were ' friends of the Kaiser.' I was just as bitter about those things as any of my friends on this side were, but it was still my desire to see the members of the great Australian Labour party come together again, and to have the breach between them healed. In spite of my bitterness against Mr. Hughes , Senator Pearce, and others I moved my motion, with the result that Mr. Hughes absolutely refused to put it to the meeting. He refused to allow his fate to be decided, not by the New South Wales executive - and this is what I should like Senator de Largie to bear in mind-  ","STATEMENT OF POLICY","COMMONWEALTH WAR MINISTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Of course he would, but evidently Mr. Hughes had made up his mind not to have anything further to do with the Australian Labour party. As soon as he landed on Australian soil he was determined that if he could not get his way in this matter of conscription he would have nothing further .to do with the Australian Labour party. The history of this great struggle shows that. There was his first speech at  Fremantle, his speech again when he reached Adelaide, and his speech in Melbourne. He declared then that he was going right on as he saw the light, and ' let those who can, arrest my progress.' He defied the movement, and he defied even his own Cabinet, the majority of whom at that time, as we know, were opposed to conscription. Will any man who wants to place the facts before the public say that Mr. Hughes was not putting himself before the Labour movement? Perhaps he thought he was right, but it is no use now for his supporters and apologists to attempt to make out that it was the Labour party that treated him badly. He asked for that treatment. He had absolutely determined that if the conscription issue did not. go his own way he would have nothing further to do with the Australian Labour party. When he was defeated, did he adopt the usual course, which he would have taken in other circumstances, of convening a meeting of his party to talk things over? No. According to his own announcement, he was going right on, and was going to have his own way. Senator de Largie himself knows that that was the position, and that Mr. Hughes refused to put the amendment which I handed in to the meeting.

I want specially to congratulate the Leader of the Senate, Senator Millen, upon his second occupation of a seat on the Treasury benches. I believe that his ability, as reflected on the floor of this chamber in the past, will in due time be equally useful in the higher office for the benefit of the country. I hope that as a result of his share in the counsels of the Government we shall have nothing to be ashamed of, or afraid of, or feel any apprehension for the future on that score. ' I am going to say, as clearly and as publicly as I can, that I intend to support this Government fully and whole-heartedly; and that if there should be any doubt about the quality of my support it will be conditioned upon the Government not going fast enough, instead of going too slowly in regard to measures for the vigorous prosecution of the war. I thought it due from me to say this, on account of the fact, as Senator Blakey has indicated, that I am not now a member of the Government; because I want people to understand that just as I endeavoured to do my duty when called upon to lead - however unworthy I may have been of that distinction - so I will follow as loyally the Government now charged with the conduct of this war.  If ever there was a time in the history of this country when it is the duty of every man to do, not as he feels free to do, but to act as he ought to act, that time is now. Therefore, in that spirit, and out of the recognition of my duty, I feel just as well satisfied to act in my humble position on the floor of the Senate as when I was elected a member of the former Government. During the course of this debate I could not help thinking that the Senate was not playing its part as a deliberative assembly. Ostensibly the purpose of this Chamber is to enable members, by the clash of thought against thought, opinion against opinion, to arrive at the wisest and sanest views. But I could not help feeling that the electors of this Commonwealth will, as the result of the Daylight Saving Bill, be saved the consumption of a considerable amount of candlelight and lamp oil, which but for that measure would have been expended uselessly in the reading of opinions expressed in this chamber on the Ministerial statement. Members on this side of the chamber do not want to be converted, because we all feel that we are on the right side, that we are standing on the firmest granite foundation, and that our views are unchallengeable. In order to make plain my position as a supporter of this Government clear, -I will recall for the benefit of honorable senators the pronouncement I made in the Western State just on the eve of the referendum campaign. At that time I thought it my. duty to those who had sent me here to inform them how I proposed to act in the future, and, therefore, at a public meeting in Perth I told them there was only one party, one policy, and one plank in that policy for me, and that was to win the war. That opinion was so clearly enunciated at the time that there was no misunderstanding about it. It was uttered in the most public way, and with no attempt to equivocate. I had mapped out a straight course, and I have not deviated from it, so far as I know, by a hair's breadth. I have strictly and religiously adhered to the policy and platform upon which the electors of the Western State elected me. I want, also, to recall for honorable senators another pronouncement, which they must have subscribed to, and which, if they have forgotten, it is necessary to remind them of, because if they wanted to keep faith with the solemn obligation they entered into with the electors of this country, they should have pledged themselves in much the same way that I did. When the elections were held in 1914, our late leader, Mr. AndrewFisher, supported by the present Prime Minister, took it upon himself to tell the country what our party would do. Upon that statement, uttered as plainly as words could be uttered to convey their meaning to the average individual, we were elected to this Parliament. The statement contained the following : - If returned with a majority, we shall pursue with the utmost vigour and determination every course necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth and the Empire in any and every contingency. Regarding, as we do, such a policy as the first duty of Government at this juncture, the electors may give their support to the Labour party with the utmost confidence. And this we say, further, that whatever be the verdict of the people, we shall not waver from the position taken up by Mr. Fisher on behalf of our party, viz., that ' in this hour of peril there are no parties, so far as the defence of the Commonwealth and Empire are concerned, and that the Opposition will co-operate with the Government and stand behind them as one man.' I do not need to emphasize what has been so well said, further than to say that when a solemn compact was about to be made between the electors of the country and the candidates in the field, Mr. Fisher said that, in the present grave emergency, there could be only one party. Mr. Fisher has been referred to, and deservedly so, by Senator O'Keefe . I want to ask that honorable senator, and those who form the party of which he is a member, what do they think now of the statement of their former leader, and why they have formed a party in opposition to the advice and the counsel which our former leader gave to the electors of this country, and by virtue of which, and on the faith of which we were elected to this Parliament, ' one party in this grave emergency '? How many parties have we now?' We have two parties, so that those men on your left, sir, are giving the lie direct to their former leader. There is no use in mincing words about this matter. These honorable senators are giving the lie direct to the solemn engagement which was made with the. electors of. the country when Mr. Fisher gave that promise in 1914. There are. two parties.

I said just now that I wanted to make my position clear when speaking in Western Australia. I will make a further reference to my public pronouncement there, not necessarily connected with the subject of my discourse this evening, but in order to show the difference between the East and the West - the temper of the time, and the tone that pervades the movement which we profess to belong to both in the East and West. In Western Australia, I said, as publicly as I could, that it was a pity that German ships were not allowed to come down our coasts and bombard some of our Eastern cities; to land a shell in the neighbourhood of the Trades Halls, and take away a wing to make them feel what they were about. I said that if they landed a whole broad-sider on the Yarra-bank Australia would be the better for it. What followed - showing the difference between the men. in the West and the men in the East? On top of that clear statement, when I gave some wholesome medicine to sluggish people as well as the Labour party, which had been wanted for a long time in the Eastern States, the miners of NorthCoolgardie sent me as their chosen representative to the Inter-State Conference in Melbourne, and the executive in Perth indorsed that nomination. I leave this point by saying that if those gentlemen who talk so loudly about the Official Labour party, only said something like- that, or something closely approaching it, we would have a healthier and more wholesome Labour movement to-day. They have not the courage to say so; they hold aloof in sullen silence when it is the imperative duty to warn and advise. When a great Frenchman web asked, ' Why do you not check the excesses of your followers?' he said, 'I must follow them, because I am their leader!' So it is with these gentlemen. They have given up the rôle of leadership, and are following behind. What leadership do they give? Can they point to a sturdy word which they have ever uttered. We, in the Western State, spoke out on various occasions, with the result that we have a healthier Labour movement to-day. Labour leaders, they call themselves 1 They are only leaders in leading strings. There was a time in the history of the Labour movement when we had leaders; when we had men who would go out and do things; when we had men upon whose actions, and upon whose word, depended the welfare and the well-being of tens of thousands of men and women in this country. Leaders then were trusted because they acted as leaders, and not as these . men opposite are acting to-day. What leadership have these honorable senators given? They have not given -the leadership that a blind dog, you see wandering down an alley, would give, so far as our movement is concerned'. Leaders, forsooth I Had they only acted as Senator Buzacott, Senator Henderson and myself did; had. they told their fellow workers what they should do, and what they should think about, as we did, we would not have the extraordinary position which exists to-day.' This strife between Labour men is due . to want of courage in alleged leaders of Labour to-day. Labour leaders, they call themselves I . Where and when have they led? They are following lamely, supinely behind and obeying the orders - nay, the commands - of the coteries at the Trades Hall. An individual requires medicine at times, but these gentlemen have given sugary pap far too long, and it- has made the Labour movement sick- unwholesome. These leaders failed to give that kind of medicine which would keep the movement healthy. That- is the chief reason why the party is in the terribly con- fused and disrupted state it is in to-day. These men gave up the role of leaders and now follow tamely, stupidly, and blindly, and on their shoulders principally rests the responsibility for the disruption which obtains to-day. Leaders they call themselves I What have they led? Leaders in leading strings they have been, and nothing more. We come now to a discussion of the constitution . of the Ministry. The Ministry has been described in various terms. It has been called antiLabour, anti-Protectionist, anti-Australian, anti-Socialistic; everything anti. We, of course, can- stand all that. The only thing I am concerned about at present is that we have in power a Ministry which is the only one that could have been formed to-day - and a good one it is, too- out of the material at hand. I would like to - see, perhaps, a Ministry going much more strongly .than the present one is doing in the direction I have indicated, namely, to see that Australia is - made safe and puts her shoulder under her proper share of the burden. When I look at the alternative, what do I find? Where am I going to get a Ministry from the other side? There is no hope in that direction. Whatever hope there ls in the present Ministry,' I Bee no hope whatever on the other side. We have, a - Ministry which, I hope, ia determined upon seeing that Australia shall muster and marshal all her forces to the last man, and I hope to the last featherweight of strength. I am sup- . porting the Ministry to-day, because I believe that we' are still in need of all the moral and physical strength which can be brought to bear upon the discharge of this country's duty and obligation as a warring nation. Why are these gentlemen going on a wild career? They were asked to come into this Ministry, but they refused. They were asked to do that in the plainest - and clearest way possible, but they sulked in their tents, and would not come in. It is quite true that the explanation is close at hand. They know that if they had come in something serious would have happened the following day. They know that they are not masters of their own actions, not masters of their own minds - nay not masters of their own souls so far as parliamentarians are concerned. They know that if they had accepted the invitation which was given to them the ' juntas ' of .the Trades Hall would have frowned upon them, and that would have been the last of them, lb is quite- understandable why they spurned -the invitation. They would have come in gladly but for the frowning ' juntas' in the distance. Let the heavens fall, the ' juntas ' must be -obeyed. They are all supreme in this land as far as these unfortunate weaklings are concerned. It is a sad chapter in the history of this young country. It is sad to find; that, independent parliamentarians have not a soul of their .own,, as these men have shown. This is no time for warring parties. This is a time when we must be united if we wish to -see victory come our way , if we -wish to see Australia maintain herself on that high pedestal where her patriotic .soldier sons placed her, but from which unfortunately she has been lowered by what has taken place. I am hopeful that as a result of the work .of the present Ministry Australia will be put -back on that pedestal, there to rest as a consequence of our making the -country face fairly and squarely the burdens ahead to-day. Let us look at what other countries -are doing compared with Australia. Is there any other country on the side -of -the Allies to-day occupying the miserable position in which honorable senators opposite would place Australia \ In Great Britain, France, and gallant little Belgium -are there to -be found political parties warring against each other? No. In reach of those countries there is only one party, and one policy, that policy -being to pat forth the country's best efforts to win the war-. But here' in Australia we have two political -parties -for the purpose of wasting our strength by reason of the -friction that -must -be engendered by their -presence in the political field. Take our Australian soldiers at the front to-day. They act in strict obedience to the commands which they receive, and in cooperation with their British brethren in the field. Indeed, the -aim -of all .the fighting forces of the Allies is to strike hard when they are required to strike, and to stay their hands -when .it is necessary .to -do so. In other words, there is -order, system, -and method in their every movement. But in Australia have we a -council of war in the political field? No; .but we have a number of ' warring councils, and in that respect our condi- tiona are quite unlike those '' which prevail in countries where our troops are fighting to-day. 16 is time that we altered our position; it is time that- .we examined ourselves closely and inquired whether we are doing the fair thing to our comrade allied nations, or the fair thing to Australia, by continuing party strife. For my part, I want to see an end. of it. That is why, some -time ago, I made my position perfectly clear, not only to my own State, but to all who cared to listen ito me. To-day, in England, there is a Labour party under the leadership of Mr. Henderson . How is it that the Labour party there, which is bound by the sazae principles, and bent upon the same objective, met the Manchester Congress -within the last few weeks with its reputation certainly .not lessened, but rather enhanced, by reason of the fact that it had -advocated conscription t How does that happen in the Old Country, where Labour principles are just as dear ito Labour advocates as they are . here 1 There Mr. Henderson was applauded for standing behind the Asquith Government and the Lloyd George Government in giving effect to national service. Again, I ask how it is that the Labour leader in the Old Country, who advocates conscription, is pronounced an innocent man, whilst his fellow Labour leader in Australia has branded on his forehead the unforgivable;sin -and is proclaimed a traitor? I say that reason will .not support 'the course pursued by the Official Labour party in Australia. It will never sustain the position of a Labourite in the Mother Country being extolled for taking up a certain attitude, Whilst a Labour member in Australia, for adopting a similar attitude, is branded as were the slaves of South Carolina. Principles do mot work backwards merely because we are -at the Antipodes. -They are eternal. If they do not apply within the complete domain of activities, they are not principles at all, but mere expedients, contemptible -makeshifts, and nothing .more. - -During the course of this discussion, Sir John Forrest and Sir- William Irvine have come in for a lot of condemnation.

I really pity them as much as I can afford to do; but may I point out to them that they can accept the situation philosophically, because the world is wide before them. Sir John . Forrest, Sir William Irvine, and Mr. Cook, I repeat, who are being assailed with all the bitterness of the Yarra Bank an& the Trades Hall junta oratory, are more staunch from a White Australia stand-point than is any member of the Official Labour party. I say this because if we come out of the present struggle parties to a drawn battle - if the Empire signs a peace which leaves Germany unbeaten - there is not a ship of the British Navy which will be able to come to Australia and fire a single shot in our defence. Every British war vessel will be held in the North Sea. It will be too late then to brush aside the false prophets who are to be found on the opposite side of this .chamber and to recognise the deadly peril which will come to this country. In such circumstances, what will happen? Australia will have to face the grim task of defending herself without the aid of the Mother Country. Can we do it? I hope that we can. But if honorable senators will recall the rare position occupied by Australia, and recollect what has been said, they will realize that this country is indeed confronted with a grave menace. Let Britain be defeated as a result of Australia failing to put 50,000 or 20,000, or even 10,000 men in the field at the critical moment, and it is Australia that will suffer. If Germany has a free road to Bagdad as the result of a drawn battle, and the means of establishing a Naval Base in the Persian Gulf , her war vessels will have a clear fourteen days' start of any British ship which can come to our assistance. Then we shall also have 12,000 miles of coast-line to defend, Let Germany be strong in the European area, let her have a road to Constantinople and an opening to the Persian Gulf, and we shall not be able to get a single ship of the British Navy to afford us the protection we have so long enjoyed.

Where will Australia be as the result of a drawn battle? She will have that long coastline to defend, with a mere handful of population. Do honorable senators realize what 12,000 miles of coast-line really means? It means a coast-line which would stretch from the top of Norway to Calcutta, and down towards Australia. And we have only a population of 5,000,000 to defend that coast-line. I again ask whether honorable senators realize the position which Australia will occupy if Germany makes the present struggle an undecided peace? We shall be then under . the eyes of people who may have designs upon us. Then there will be no time for Chinese or Maltese fictions, or Liberal or Labour or socialistic contemptible party issues. Those of us who wish to retain liberty and. freedom in this country will have to get* busy, as the Americans say, with something else. It is to ward off that probable,, that almost certain position, which will result if the war ends in a draw, that I have taken a stand right down to the present period. These are some home facts for these gentlemen.  When that dread time comes, when the designing enemy plunges upon us - and this may happen long before we are aware of it, for the assassin may come upon us as he pounced on to peaceful Belgium, when we are ill-prepared : we can only hold our own, with our 12,000 miles of coast-line, by a miracle happening. It is to avoid the chance of miracles happening that I have at all times tried to open the minds of these men, who have been steeped in miserable party prejudice up to their eyelids. Blinded to higher questions of national concern, they have always been thinking about how their party is to fare. The enemy will not be bothered about our parties. The only concern that our potential enemy will have is for our country. He will not bother whether it is Liberal or Labour if he has his eyes on this country, as he has. If the result of this titanic struggle is a drawn battle, we shall have either to remodel our external policy or take the consequences, and these men know it. Yet they go out to their juntas far and wide, and bow the knee to Baal, influenced by contemptible and miserable considerations for their own political safety, when the safety, liberty, and independence of Australia are being weighed in the balance.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","430","LYNCH, Patrick","KRZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","10692","I have been looking for a solution of the problem why the Official Labour party had. declared against' vigorous action in the war, and have been striving to follow the genesis of the movement in order to get a grip of the position. The present position is partly the result of vital necessity and partly the result of these men failing to act the part of leaders. The Labour party first came into existence to adjust certain unevennesses in our social sphere. In its origin it was a bread-and-butter movement, and nothing else. It did not concern itself with national or defence questions. Only when it gained in popularity and numbers did it broaden out and consider the advisable- ness of wrestling with such national problems. I believe it is partly owing to the nature of its origin that the Labour movement still holds aloof from the national effort. In the early days we troubled ourselves not at all about military or naval questions, or other national issues, but justifiably only with questions affecting our livelihood, and how to get better wages and more equitable conditions. That natal sentiment of the party still survives, but, apart from that consideration, I am going to lay the blame on those men who failed to lead. The Labour party contains men who call themselves leaders, but who are not leading at all, and it is they who are mainly responsible for the attitude of Labour to-day. The workaday supporter of our party naturally looks for a lead to those of us who, for the time being, are in a wider and more elevated sphere of action, with larger powers and opportunities of observation. But how is he being led? Those who should be his leaders are stooping with their ears to the ground to learn what is going to happen. That is how the present difficulty has come upon us. . When you, Mr. Deputy President, were at Kalgoorlie with Senator Buzacott,and we were fighting there, as it became Labour leaders to fight, when we were dealing with men just as firm in the Labour movement as any that can be found in Australia, we at last succeeded in bringing them to our way of thinking, with the result that the Labour movement in the West ranged itself behind the Hughes Government, and in that respect differed from the Labour movement in any of the other States.

Had he talked -to his fellow Labourites as he talks to his fellow members here - and they want talking to - we should have had no trouble in our movement to-day. Had these -alleged leaders led as they ought to have -done, the movement would have been saved. But they failed miserably, disgustingly, sadly, throughout Australia to give that lead which their followers were -entitled to expect. I have mentioned poor dog Tray before as typifying the class of Labourites in the Official party, but poor dog Tray was a rampant lion compared with these alleged latter-day leaders of the Labour party. Leaders! On their head lies the responsibility, and they cannot dodge it. We in Western Australia have as good Labour material as is to be found in any part of the continent. We have men there harder to deal with than those in the older Eastern 'States. We have advanced thinkers there, but we got them to reason with us and realize the position and to range themselves behind -the Government. The Official Labour movement threw itself on its own sword, and when the historian comes to write the history of our movement he will say, ''It came to an early death through want of wisdom and want of courage.' It is true that there is wisdom and courage in its ranks, but where courage has been shown wisdom has been lacking, and vice versâ  We, who have shown some independence in the fight, have been called nice names, and I should like to deal gently with some of the classic names applied to us. According to Senator Turley, we have sold the Labour movement. According to the honorable Leader of the Official Labour party, we are ' rats ' and ' renegades '; but when Senator Gardiner was in Western Australia, dealing with men who knew what they were about, he was as mild as mother's milk. He never uttered a word about ' rata ' or ' renegades,' but when he got here amongst his party of barrackers in the Federal Parliament, he used offensive terms that he was not game to utter in the West. Had he done so there he would have been dealt with quick and lively. Those are nice names to apply to men who have shown the courage we have shown. And how contradictory these men are! On the one hand they call Mr. Hughes an autocrat, and, almost in the same breath, the subservient tool of the Cook party. He is two different things at the one time. ' Bats ' ' and ' ' renegades ' ' are not names that can be applied with truth to a party that, went out as we did to brave the storm, run the risks, and face all the abuse and opposition that could be raised against us. They were all visualized in front of us when we went out into the open way, on leaving the Official Labour party. A ' rat ' does not often brave danger. It is the men who have remained behind that have proved themselves entitled to those epithets. The chief of the head-hunters here on the left has said that we are 'rats' and 'renegades.' That sounds well, does it not? coming from the leader of the chain gang.

This political chain gang says ' Yes ' all the time to the dominant juntas. 'Kate and renegades!' Is it nob inspiring thai that grand old man, Mr. Spence, who for the last forty years has fought the fight of the Labour movement, should be called a rat and a renegade? Does it not sound enchanting? Mr. Hughes, the present Leader of the Government, whose matchless brain has been at the service of his fellow toilers in this country all the rounds of the clock for the last twenty-five Tears, is suddenly discovered to be a traitor. Mr. Christian Watson is, with others associated with Mr. Hughes, amongst those who have been described as rats and traitors.  I have said that I desire to put some true wisdom into the party opposite. The difficulty is that they have lost their head. The head is on this side, and the trunk is on the opposite side. I am reminded, by the unfortunate position of the deplorable party on the left of the Chair, which having lost its head is moved now only by muscular action, and nob brains: - of the fact that if you suddenly cut the head off a turkey gobbler he will run about for a time just as well as he did before, so long as there is not a waterhole or fence in front of it. In fact I have seen one run better after he had lost his head than he ever ran before he lost it. The party opposite appear to be running very well to-day, though it represents only the trunk, as the head is on this side. Passing along Bourke-street the other day I saw brains for sale. I believe the offer is still open, and I advise the Official Labour party to call a Caucus meeting at once, tonight, without any loss of time, and corner that supply of brains. They are only bullocks' brains, but they would be better than the kind which honorable senators opposite now possess. Their only chance of salvation is in the adoption of some measure of the kind, because since they deliberately cut their own head off there has been nothing but division in their councils. There is one thing done in this State, and something quite different is done or approved in another. The Official Labour party in every State is supposed .to be the same, and to have but one aim and object. But what is happening to-day? From Queens- # land comes the order from the frowning junta there saying to representatives of that State, ' * At the peril of your life do not vote for the referendum upon conscription.' From Victoria there came the same order, ' Do not dare to vote for the referendum, although it is on our platform. Don't you dare to do it,' and we had poor people here shivering like a do? in a wet sack, knowing that if they did vote for it their political careers would be finished, and they might as well cut their political throats as dare to disobey the irrevocable command. The sword was hung over the heads of the unfortunate Queenslanders, who looked as men never looked before, and shuddered. Representatives of New South Wales were given liberty to vote for the referendum, and so were representatives of South Australia and Western Australia. There was a division amongst the States once the head was removed. To vote for the referendum was an unforgivable offence in some of the States, though it was part of the platform upon which Labour representatives of those States were elected to this. Parliament. What happened at Adelaide the other day? The organizations directing the members of the Official Labour party solemnly came to the conclusion that for the future military training for home defence was to be wiped off the statute-book. Do honorable senators opposite agree with that? In Western Australia we have been given the liberty to which we are entitled, which we claimed, and which we would, demand in dealing with the question. We. voted for the referendum, and secured consideration for the main issue of conscription. Let us consider the division in the Labour party on that main issue, and we shall find that again the reasoning power was gone from our honorable friends opposite. On the subject of the referendum they were at sixes and sevens, and in the Eastern States on the issue of conscription they were again at sixes and sevens when they ignored the men who could see ahead' and were not afraid to point the path' of duty. We were invited to believe that the principle was so sacred that it must be approached with bare feet. Our friends said, ' Don't advocate conscription. If you do you are a traitor.' In Western Australia this alleged sacred principle was not regarded as a principle at all, or if it was, why were Western Australian representatives given a free hand in dealing with it? In the Eastern States it was a sacred principle,, and conscription must not be mentioned' because the wretched leaders of Labour in. those States cowardly deserted their -nests and permitted the juntas to dictate to them. That is what happened, because those who should have been leaders crept into the back lanes and by-ways, instead' of walking, manfully into the councils of Labour and facing them as they should* have done, and as we did in the western State. We have as many different decisions to-day on the referendum and on conscription as there are States in the Commonwealth, and the reason is because the brains are gone, and now confusion? reigns. I shall say a word about the junta. Our honorable friends do not like the word '' junta ' at all. What is it? It is nothing more nor less than an interloping body that comes between the electors and the elected on questions on which there was a clear understanding between both. I would not object to the junta if it- kept, its place. But when it came down and gave the orders I have referred to, I say that there was no room and no use, and no possible purpose for any such institution in any true Democracy. A true Democracy, if it means anything, means that each individual shall have the* aright to the expression of his opinion an any and every circumstance, but particularly when the country is in danger. No opinion should then be stifled as the junta succeeded in stifling opinion. What was done in connexion with the issue of conscription which has divided the Labour party? What is our crime? Our crime is that we advocated conscription, and yet I venture to say that there are not a dozen men in the Official Labour party who are convinced in their heart of hearts that conscription is the wrong thing. If I chose to make trouble I could name those in the Official Labour party who have said as clearly as language can convey their ideas that conscription is the right thing, and yet they went out and urged the electors to vote against it.

That being the case, the onus and responsibility for carrying on the meeting rested with the signers of the requisition, and they should have had the' courage to say what they meant.

Then only did we get the strength of the meeting. The motion proposed, in set terms, the expulsion of Mr. Hughes from the chair, and without giving any reasons. The Prime Minister of Australia and a leader of the Labour party for twenty-five years, though he had a stainless record hitherto, was to be expelled from the chair without any reasons being given.

These are the men who asked Mr. Hughes to go out to the executives and say to them, ' Save us or we perish.' 'Why did they not object to it then?

It matters not how faithfully or how long a member may have served Labour; it matters not if the country is rocking on its foundation, if he dares to differ from the junta he is condemned, doomed, and damned. I say, however, that we have not yet arrived at the time when that state of things will be tolerated. There is no First Offenders Act in the legal code of the junta. First offence or not, it is a case of ' off with his head.' That is the code of the junta to-day.

The people who voted for conscription would vote again and again for it and glory in the fact.  There would be no impassable gulf between that side and this side. But these men, unable and incapable to realize a situation of that kind, divided the household, and the least they should have done was to be tolerant towards those men who hold a different opinion. Instead of being that they went on their wild, mad career, saying to every one who dare oppose them, ' Persecute; off with his head; how dare he have an opinion?'How dare he, they said, have an opinion which Labourites in the Old Country have expressed, and have been extolled for expressing? Senator ' Gardiner talked about the freedom in this Democracy of Australia. Let me tell the honorable senator that the freedom which we enjoy here is not a freedom which was won by anybody here, but is a freedom which was won in other lands by men fighting down through the centuries. My people in the Old Country helped to win .the freedom which is enjoyed in this new country. It is idle and misleading, and against historical facts to say that the freedom which we enjoy was obtained or won by any effort on our part. It is the result of what was done in other countries through grim, weary struggles, and we are here to see that it is not violated. We are here to stand up for Australia, to see that a free independence is handed down to our children and our children's children, full weight, full measure, and full quality, as the result of our efforts to-day. If we do not do something now under the leadership of this Government to make Australia carry out her full share in this war, and anything results which will impair our freedom, the responsibility will rest with us ' and with us alone. We are the custodians of the liberty of the generations who will follow us. If Australia fails fo put forward a full effort, and if, as the result of our blindness, our failure to toe the scratch, and put man for man in the field, unborn generations will remember us not with pride as we remember our forefathers, but remember us with shame to our eternal discredit. We are up against no simple problem. We are here to defend this country to the utmost. Senator Gardiner dared to draw a distinction between the native born and those who have come from other lands. He dared to point to Sir John Forrest and Sir William Irvine. Did you, sir, ever hear from a public man before such a small-minded utterance as he dared to indulge in when he said that the native born are better men than persons born outside the confines of Australia? I will not yield to Senator Gardiner or to anybody else. I have done as much to advance the material interests of Australia as perhaps he has ever done. It does not enhance his reputation, coming from Botany Bay or its neighbourhood, to find fault with those who have come from another land, and have a clean bill of health, so far as genealogy is concerned. Coming from that quarter, he should be the last man in this chamber to dare to impugn the honesty or motives of those who happened to be born outside of Australia. We are here, and have done our bit for this country. Since I landed as a youth in Queensland, if it is calculated on a purely cash basis, this country is in my debt. But side by side with that position I realize that I owe something to this country by virtue of the outstanding monumental fact that, in dear and glorious Australia, I have had the opportunity of rising from the lowest stratum in the social structure to the highest position which the people of Western Australia thought I was fit for. I regard as my own land this country where I found a haven of refuge. We need to see that, in defending the Democracy of Australia, we make men who have shown themselves either too short-sighted or too narrow-minded, realize the true position. We need to see that they shall be thrust aside to make way for men who have a keener perception of the fateful circumstances of the hour. This, I say, is a fateful hour in the history of our country. Let there be a drawn battle, and Australia will have to fight, and then there will be no chance of putting up those shibboleths which did duty as arguments during the time which we would all like to forget. That is more than a contingency to me, because I realize that if Australia does not look to herself, and achieve a victory as a result of our contribution to the common effort, she alone of all parts of the Empire will stand to suffer the most by virtue of her isolation. I am here, therefore, to do my best for my adopted land, and I intend to use all the power I can command to see that, regardless of consequences, Australia does her utmost, and gets her shoulder full square under her share of the burden. I still believe that, as a result of the effort which the present Government will make with a huge following behind them in the country, we will proclaim to the world that, after all, ' Australia will still be there ' in this fight.

My statement was that whilst the honorable senator was in Western Australia he attempted to take particular credit to himself for the measures which were enacted at the instance of the Fisher Government during 1910 and 1911. He has done the same thing in this chamber, and my statement was that, so far from any particular merit attaching to him in connexion with the legislation passed by that Government, if the divisions were counted up, it would be found that he had voted as often against the Government as had Senator Millen. I have not had time to go through all the Journals of the Senate, but I have gone through them for the year 1911, which was a full year. As a result I find that my statement was pretty accurate. In compiling the results I merely looked down the division lists, and wherever Senator Gardiner voted with the late Senator McGregor, who was Leader of the Government at the time, I counted his vote as having Been cast for the Government. The Journals show that during the year 1911 Senator Gardiner voted thirty-six times for the Government and twenty-five times against it. It will thus be seen that he was a .particularly impartial Government supporter. I stated this afternoon that 'the honorable senator was never happy unless he was in opposition, and I think that the figures which I have quoted are a sufficient justification for my statement.

The cable was dated the 21st November. I immediately forwarded the amount to the Commonwealth Bank through the London Bank, Goulburn. I received another cable, dated the 19th January, saying that he had not received the money. This cable was received on the 8th February, at Goulburn. The position of this cadet was that he arrived at Trinity College with 2s. fid. in his possession, and was in very straitened circumstances, having no friends in England, and also having to purchase uniform, books, &c, and no money to do it with. The lad was in great stress of mind at being in such a position. He left Australia as a corporal, and kept ls. Gd. per day out of his pay for necessary expenses, allowing the other amount to accumulate. I made inquiries at the London Bank, and also the Commonwealth Bank, and they state that the amount went on. The Governor of the Bank states that the cadet could not have received the notice from the Commonwealth Bank, London, but, if so, how was it that, on the 19th January, it was not there when inquired after? I have had three cables over this matter from London, the first took twenty-seven days, the second fifteen days, and the third twenty days to reach me. We received a letter from him saying that, as a last resort, he sent to his brother, who is lieutenant in charge of a machine-gun section (a graduate from Duntroon), who was in the firing line at the time with the 9th Brigade. It reached him, and he was able to send him over 200 francs, which reached him a few days before Christmas. As the course closed for eight days at that period, where he could have put in his time without funds would have been a. problem.

Then I wish to direct attention to the position that is occupied, by certain inmates of our benevolent institutions. In reply to certain questions which I put to the Minister in this connexion I was told that the information I sought was not available. I should like it to be made available. In the Newcastle district there is a benevolent home containing a number of male and female inmates, fifteen of whom do not receive the old-age pension, notwithstanding that they are over sixty and sixty-five years, of age respectively. The reason assigned' for this is that they were not in receipt, of the Commonwealth pension prior to entering the institution. Some of them were in receipt of an old-age pension under the State Government, prior to the. Commonwealth taking over the pension business. But simply because they are inmates of that home they have to be maintained by it at the expense of those who enable it to be carried on. My contention is that every old person in the Commonwealth is entitled to the-, pension. If the benevolent authorities chose to turn these inmates out of the home they could make them eligible for the pension. But they cannot find it in their hearts to treat them with such harshness. I certainly think that the Government ought to give this matter earnest consideration. I do hope that something will be done immediately to remedy the existing state of things.
