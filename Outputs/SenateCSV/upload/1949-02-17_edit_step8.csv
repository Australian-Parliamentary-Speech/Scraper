Certain of his departmental officers have been collating information relating to the application of divorce laws in the States. The Constitution permits the Commonwealth to legislate in respect of divorce. As honorable members are aware, that power was invoked recently for the purpose of avoiding difficulty with relation to domicile by reason of husbands and wives moving from one State to another. Arrangements were made which favoured the wives of ex-servicemen of other countries who subsequently deserted them. Those are the only two laws that the Commonwealth has made under the Constitution. The complexity of this task will be appreciated when it is remembered that the divorce laws of the six States are different, and that there are further divorce laws operating in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory under Commonwealth aegis. I assure the Senate that the drawing-up of uniform legislation in this matter is a very difficult task if even-handed justice is to be meted out and if the conflicting points of view of people in this country are to be reconciled. As the honorable senator has said, where insanity persists for a lengthy period, in some instances for seven years, and where it has been certified that that condition cannot be cured, that is a ground for divorce in some States. Even that has to be looked at from many aspects. When insanity has not persisted for a definite time, and is remediable, it would not be an adequate ground for divorce. That field in itself is difficult. I assure the Senate that the whole of the divorce laws in this country are being fully examined.","DIVORCE LAWS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

On Saturday morning last I conferred with the Prime Minister respecting this matter, and, as a result, certain arrangements were made between the Prime Minister and the Premier of Western Australia. The Prime Minister approved the Premier's application for 35,000 gallons of petrol to be provided for the generation of power, and a further 15,000 gallons of petrol for purposes associated with refrigeration. I have not seen the article in the West Australian to which the honorable senator has referred. I should think that any statement which Mr. Cuming, the Director of Rationing, would make would be in accordance with the decision arrived at by the Prime Minister and myself for the provision of substitute fuel for Western Australia. The honorable senator has requested that the position be reviewed. I point out that a similar position exists in New South Wales, where what are known as ' blackouts' occur very frequently. I do not mean to be critical of the Sydney County Council. Frankly, I believe that its difficulties in this respect are a legacy from the last war, when, because of war conditions, plant which had been ordered for the Bunnerong power station and other power plants could not be delivered. Consequently, such organizations do not possess adequate plant to meet the increased demands arising from the expansion of industry generally. However, if substitute fuel were to be provided whenever a black-out threatened in New South Wales, very limited supplies of such fuel could be made available outside that State.","AUXILIARY POWER PLANTS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Those rates could he fixed by the board in exactly the same way as rates were fixed by the Australian Wheat Board, and if they were less than award rates the employees would be at: a disadvantage until they could be brought under some award. A safeguarding proviso such as I have suggested would protect the interests not only of one group of employees but also of all other persons employed by the board. I have especially in mind the interests of less skilled classes of employees, such as office cleaners. Different awards apply to office cleaners in different States.

Honorable senators who were familiar with the legislation of 1923 will recall that the power vested in the Australian Shipping Board to raise money then was very carefully safeguarded and limited. I notice in this clause that the amount that the proposed Australian Shipping Board may raise by way of bank overdraft, without the consent or even the knowledge of the Parliament, will be entirely unlimited. Section 16 of the previous act provided that a bank overdraft or an advance from the Treasurer could be obtained by the Australian Shipping Board for working capital. I notice also that this clause 19 does not provide for security to be given to the Treasury for any 'advance that may be made from time to time. It is conceivable that the proposed board, being a corporation and a trading concern, could incur very heavy obligations. Damages for negligence might be awarded against it as the result of an accident, yet some huge amount of money that might have been advanced by the Treasurer would be completely unsecured. The previous legislation provided for debentures to be given by the board to the Government for any advances made from time to time. Furthermore, there was a limitation upon the total amount of advances that could be made. The total amount advanced to the board could not exceed 25 per cent, of the debentures already issued and still unredeemed. If at any time the board wanted to raise further capital, it had to do so by the issue of debentures, but only with the consent of .both Houses of Parliament. In other words, parliamentary control and contact were closely maintained. That was a very sound procedure, and I urge the Minister to accept my suggestion that limits be placed upon the amount that may be borrowed by the proposed board by way of bank overdraft and the amount that may be advanced to it by the Treasurer out of appropriations. I also urge that the board he required to provide security to the Commonwealth for any advances made either by way of overdraft or from appropriations.","N/A","SHIPPING BILL 1948","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Licences may also be revoked or varied at the request of the licensee. The purpose of the bill is to enable a planned programme of shipconstruction to he arranged for the various Australian shipyards. It is proposed that the construction of vessels shall he distributed amongst the available shipyards, according to the type of vessel to be constructed and the work on hand in the various yards. Orders will be allocated so as to enable vessels of the type that is most needed in the Australian coastal trade to be constructed first. The total volume of shipbuilding will also be regulated, and orders will be spread over a period of years. The Government has already commenced to implement that policy. The reason is that it is necessary to ensure the establishment of the industry on a permanent basis, and the shipyards must he guaranteed continuity of work. One of the main reasons why the industry languished between the two world wars was that whilst there was an unseemly rush to construct vessels immediately after World War I., no provision was made to defer any of that construction so as to keep the shipyards going when the boom had passed. The Government intends that in the initial period of the resurrection of the shipbuilding industry in this country, some work will be postponed to a later period in order to avoid a repetition of the situation that confronted this country on the outbreak of World War II. Whilst we realize the need to replace old shipping tonnage, it is even more necessary to protect the industry, as far as possible,;i gainst a slump in a few years' time. A ,-pvere slump in the industry would result in the dispersal of plant, skilled manpower and shipbuilding resources. Furthermore, the Government proposes to institute a degree of standardization of design. The requirements of certain classes of trade require the construction of vessels of a particular design and equipment, and that need will be kept in mind. However, it is intended, as far as possible, to insist upon standardization, for example, of size, tonnage, hull design,, power units and other important components. The reason for the Government's decision to insist upon a degree of standardization is the necessity to reduce the costs of production. My remarks are intended to apply not so much to marine engines as to hulls, internal fittings, gear for the handling of cargo and other special fittings. I have previously mentioned that the two vessels recently constructed by the Commonwealth that were sold to private shipping interests were designed largely in accordance with the wishes of those interests. The provisions of the measure will he administered by the Department of Shipping and Fuel, in close collaboration with the Australian Shipping Board, and the board will be responsible for advising the department concerning the allocation of shipyard's and plant. It should be noted that the provisions concerning licences for shipbuilding apply to the construction of all vessels of over 200 tons, whether they are to be employed in intra-state or interstate' trade, and are not confined to vessels engaging in any particular class of trade. It is not confined to vessels engaging in trade. A penalty of?1,000 or, if the offence is a continuing one,?1,000 for each day during which the offence continues, is provided for offences against this clause.

Of course that depends upon the interpretation to be placed on the meaning of that word. 1 do not say that the authority to be established under this measure will grant, any preference to private enterprise or any one else.

I point out that there are in service many ships up to 30 years of age which are still in excellent condition. 1. should like to know what will be the position in relation to those vessels. As honorable senators are aware, in the past, for certain reasons, ships have been built cheaply by various shipbuilding yards in the world. As a result they deteriorated quickly, particularly when their maintenance wa3 not as good as it could have been. In many other instances in which vessels were built in good shipbuilding yards, to high standards, and where their maintenance has been regular and good, they are every bit as good after 40 years of service as are other ships 22 or 23 years old. 1 point out that during the war Liberty ships were built to low standards; in many instances it was only intended that they should make one or two voyages and would then be expendable. Many of the better class vessels which are older than 24 years could continue for years to give excellent service on the Australian coast. In view of the fact that we are very short of shipping I assume that the Minister will exercise discretion in the allocation of licences, and that when a ship is a little over 24 years old and is still required, consideration will be given to maintaining it and keeping it in service.","N/A","SHIPPING BILL 1948","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[49]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Some of them are still capable of carrying passengers and cargo and rendering efficient service. I point out that the object of limiting the life of ships officially to 24 years was to provide for a continuity of work in the shipbuilding yards of Australia. A further reason was ro ensure that up-to-date transport for both passengers and cargo would be maintained. 1 think that all honorable senators will agree that those are very worthy objectives. Another important aspect of the matter is that in many of the ships that have been trading on the Australian coast for years, adequate accommodation is not provided for the seamen, firemen, and others employed on them. In the ships recently built in Australia, the accommodation provided for the crew is vastly superior to that in some of the older ships that I have mentioned. This is in conformity with the general trend to-day for advancement in every sphere of Australian life.","N/A","SHIPPING BILL 1948","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[50]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"
