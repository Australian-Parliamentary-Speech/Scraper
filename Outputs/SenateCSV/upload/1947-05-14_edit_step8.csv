The present exceptional demand overseas for new vehicles is such that the motor industry is unable to supply the whole of the quantity of new chassis which Australia is prepared to take. The industry has not been able to keep pace with production schedules owing to scarcity of essential materials and other factors which have limited the output. A contributory reason for the shortage is the difficulty of maintaining, production of locally built and assembled bodies for the chassis, which have been imported due mainly to the scarcity of steel, sheets and other material requirements. The productive capacity for motor body building in Australia is sufficient to supply normal requirements, but the available production has been directed towards supplying bodies for the chassis ot makes in greatest demand. I understand that this has resulted in delays, in equipping some types of chassis with bodies, but the causes ot such delays are due to factors over which the Government has no control. 2.No. The Government has- endeavoured to relieve the position by seeking new sources of supply of deep drawing auto body type steel sheets, but this type of sheet is not available in sufficient quantities to supply any appreciable portion of Australia's requirements.

Thetotal payments each year were: -  It is not possible toestimate extra costs involved in the proposed bill because weekly payments to the seaman himself have been reduced, and increased benefits given to wives and children. No estimate can be made of the accidents that will occur to married seamen or of thenumber of dependants they will have, nor of the severity of the injuries. Extra insurance costs cannot be estimated. Claims made on shipping companies arc paid by mutual protection clubs, and calls are made on the industry in accordance with the amounts actually paid for various liabilities of which seamen's compensation is only one. 4.It is difficult to compare the various State compensation acts with one another or with the Seamen's Compensation Act. Some features, however, can be compared. (State acts cover all workers, including seamen): - Each State act is limited to workers not earning more than a certain amount, which varies from £416 in Tasmania to £750 in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. There is no limit in the Seamen's Compensation Act. The maximum payments in case of. death are - Seamen's Compensation Act (proposed in bill) - £800 plus £25 for each dependent child. Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act - £800 plus £25 for each dependent child. New South Wales - £800 plus £25 for each dependent child. Victoria - £l,000 plus £25 for each dependent child. Queensland - £800 plus £25 for each dependent child. South Australia - £750. Western Australia - £750. Tasmania - £1,000 plus £25 for each dependent child. Maximum medical and hospital expenses allowed are - Seamen's Compensation Act (proposed in bill)- £100. Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act- £100. New South Wales - £50 (extra in special cases ) . Victoria - £75 (£100 in special cases). Queensland - £50. South Australia - £25. Western Australia - £100. Tasmania - £50.

South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania make no provision for injury whilst travelling to and from work. The other States provide such cover.

In view of the complex political situation that has existed in the area, no alternative arrangement has been either practicable or appropriate. ' Functions of an information nature are being discharged by the consulate-general in the course of its normal duties. These functions are supplemented by daily short-wave broadcasts in Dutch and Malay from Australia. The point to be made is that in South-East Asia, Australia and other powers have had to adapt the nature and scale of their representation to the particular circumstances obtaining from time to time in each country where representation is necessary. In most of these countries there have been varying degrees of instability, of one kind or another, as a result of the Japanese war. This is especially true of the Netherlands East Indies where the prospect of settled conditions is only justnow appearing. The Australian Government, which has already established Australian consular representation at six points in South-East Asia whore none existed before, namely, at Singapore, Manila, Bangkok, Batavia, Dili and Colombo, is fully alive to what is required in the way of future representation.

It was then that the appeal to the High Court was instituted. I dealt with this matter fully last Friday. TheGovernment wants speedy decisions in relation to matters affecting industrial disputes. It has strengthened the appellate jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, until now, for the first time, it is the final court of appeal from all judicial decisions of inferior tribunals in proceedings for breaches of awards, offences against the act, matters of interpretation, and so on. So, rather than the status of the Commonwealth Arbitration Courtbeing undermined by this measure, that court is having vested in it an appellate jurisdiction which hitherto has been lacking.

I also indicated that I was more particularly interested in what had transpired during the war years, when certain appeals were made from the Arbitration Court to the High Court in circumstances that negated justice. I invited the Leader of the Opposition to have regard to these developments down the years from 1940 to the present. With great respect to the Leader of the Opposition and to other honorable senators opposite, I inform them that the Government has made up its mind to limit appeals from the Arbitration Court.

An award or order of a Conciliation Commissioner shall not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question, or be subject to prohibition, mandamus or injunction, in any Court on any accountwhatever. Before dealing with any suggested amendment of proposed new section 20 to provide for a right of appeal to the ArbitrationCourt. I should like the Minister for Health (Senator McKenna) to explain the position in regard to wage pegging regulations, particularly the effect of statutory rule No. 49 of 1947, dated the 9th April, 1947. In order that we may understand what the law will be when this measure is assented to, I propose to read the regulation covered by the statutory rule mentioned. It relates to an amendment of National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations, and reads - Regulation 18 of theNational Security (Economic Organization) Regulations is amended by omitting sub-regulations (3.) and (4.) and inserting in their stead the following subregulations: - . ' (3.) Where the matter of an alteration of a rate of remuneration comes before an Industrial Authority or Public Employment Authority by a plaint, reference or application or by a proposal for an industrial agreement lodged with or made to that Authority, and that Authority has not, under any other provision of this Part, authority to do any Act or thing to effect the alteration, that Authority shall if, after a preliminary hearing or examination of the matter, the Authority is of opinion that the grounds on which the alteration is sought provide primafacie evidence that an alteration should be made, submit - in the case of matters affecting members of the Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation (other than those members who are excepted by the Commonwealth Coal Commissioner by order in pursuance of the Coal Production (War-time) Act 1944 or by the Joint Coal Board by order in pursuance of the CoalIndustry Act 1946- to the Chairman of the Joint Coal Board: and in the case of all other matters - to the Chief Judge of the Court, a statement setting out - the grounds on which the alteration is sought: the reasons for the opinion of the Authority: and the principles by which the Authority would be guided in making the alteration. ' (4.) The Chief Judge of the Court or the Chairman of the Joint Coal Board, as the case may be. after consideration of the statement, may, if he is satisfied that it is not opposed to the national interest so to do, make an order authorizing the industrial Authority or Public Employment Authority, on such conditions and subject to such limitations as the Chief Judge or the Chairman of the Joint Coal Board, in his discretion, thinks fit, to proceed to hear and determine, or to do any act or thing in relation to, the matter of the alteration.'. I understand that when this legislation is proclaimed proposed section 21 will stand, and also that wage-pegging regulations to which I have just referred will stand. If that be so, a peculiar situation will arise. If the wage-pegging regulations remain, before any of the fifteen . conciliation commissioners can make an award providing for increased rates of pay he will have to obtain the approval of the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court. This matter was raised in the press and it was discussed in the House of Representatives, but for some unknown reason the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) did not refer to that aspect of the measure in his second-reading speech. Perhaps he thought that it was a matter of high political importance, but whether it was by accident or design, the fact remains that he did not deal with- that point. This committee ought to know that the general opinion held by the public is that the conciliation commissioners will be free, and that their decisions will not be subject to appeal. That misunderstanding may lead to confusion and illfeeling. I do not know how many cases are likely to be affected, or what types of cases which would be subject to those regulations might arise, but I am certain that when this legislation has been assented to there will be hundreds of cases which will come before the conciliation commissioners for determination. If my contention that the' wage-pegging regulations will still remain in force be correct, I can visualize a state of affairs arising which will make it physically impossible for the Chief Judge to say whether an increase of wages will, or will not, be in the interests of national economy. As this is a matter of great importance, I sought legal advice regarding it. Among those from whom opinions were sought was the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives (Mr. Menzies). The first paragraph in his opinion reads - Further consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill now before Parliament discloses a feature of immense importance which so far appears to have escaped parliamentary attention. That paragraph draws attention to the disadvantages associated with the use of the guillotine - a practice by which legislation is rushed through before it has been thoroughly discussed. The right honorable gentleman,' who is a recognized authority , on these matters, then asks the following questions : - Is it the intention of the Government that the new Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should terminate -wage-pegging? If so, the public and particularly the trade unions, should be told this plainly. If, on the other hand, the Government believes that the new bill does not over-rule the previous regulations will it say so plainly? Will it equally make it clear to the public that, on that view of the legislation, there will be in effect an appeal to the Chief Judge on questions of remuneration on a great number of the decisions of the conciliation commissioners, since the last wage-pegging regulations gave this control to the Chief Judge and not to the. Full Arbitration Court? Time will be saved if the Minister in charge of the ' bill will explain exactly what restrictions will be imposed on the conciliation commissioners by the wage pegging regulations to which I have referred. I again ask the Minister whether the conciliation commissioners will be limited by the wage-pegging regulations. Having obtained that information, the committee will be in a position to discuss the matter fully.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","105","MCKENNA, Nicholas","KTN","Tasmania","ALP","N/A","2295","The Leader of the Opposition (Senator McLeay) has suggested that the question of the relation of the wage-pegging regulations to the bill now under consideration escaped parliamentary attention. It is true that it escaped parliamentary attention when the bill was before the House of Representatives; but it is also true that the matter had full consideration by the Government. If there was a failure to deal with the matter in the Parliament, the fault does not lie with the Government; and that for another good reason, too, that the legal position is obvious. It is true that the wage-pegging regulations operate to-day, not under the National Security Act but under the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act, and with limited operation only to the 31st December next to override and control the provisions that are .being inserted in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act under this bill, which is of a permanent nature. I do not like throwing Latin phrases at honorable senators, but I suggest that this matter is governed by the. phrase, generalia specialibus non derogant, which means that special provisions override general provisions. To reduce that to lay terms: Here we have a special act, the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act, giving the virtue of statutory law to the regulations which the Leader of the Opposition has read. When the bill was drafted it was decided not to incorporate anything in it which was related to an act, or regulation, of such transient operation as the regulation cited by the Leader of the  Opposition. But for another reason, too, the wage-pegging regulations apply. The Leader of the Opposition read the regulation dated the 9th April, and. I shall not read it again. The effect of it is, as he has stated, that where an industrial authority, and' that will include a conciliation commissioner, is about to make an award he must first seek the concurrence of the Chief Judge if, and if only, the rate of remuneration is affected. The broad question of rates is left to the court; and there are numerous matters outside the question of remuneration that a conciliation commissioner can attend to under the wage-pegging: regulations to-day without any reference at all to the Chief, Judge. I draw the attention of the' committee to this position: The wage-pegging regulation cited' by the Leader of the Opposition determines what shall happen before an award is made. An industrial authority, contemplating the making- of an. award, must go to the Chief Judge and tell him what he has in contemplation, the principles he- proposes to apply and the reasons for the proposition he is putting to the Chief Judge. Section 20 (1) refers to ' an award, or- order of a conciliation commissioner. That; unquestionably, means a valid order, or a valid award; and a-- conciliation commissioner, under another law dealing- with anterior aspects of making an award, must consult the Chief Judge. The two thing?- are in water-tight compartments; and the intention in the mind of the Government, at- least, has always been that the wage-pegging regulations- shall apply, despite the amendments only that are now being- effected 1 to the principal act: I- do not think that is going- to cause- any industrial trouble, or1 unrest: There,, certainly, was no attempt on the part of the Government to conceal that' position. I disagree with the Leader of the Opposition- when he says that there is a general impression that this bill will dispose of wage-pegging regulations. From my association with the' industrial units of the country; that is completely wrong; There is the clearest' understanding: industrially that wage1 pegging regulations shall continue to apply. The unionists' understand, too, that those regulations must come up for parliamentary review before' the end of the year. They understand, further that the Government' is continually reviewing' the position regarding wage-pegging, and has given ample evidence of its desire' to terminate the operation of those' regulations as soon as possible. Honorable senators will remember that in March last year the first relaxation: took place when the- unions' were permitted to go to the Arbitration Court on the two main questions of hours and wages; and, in fact, if the Leader of the Opposition has followed closely the trend of events' from that day lie will find that the initiative has remained' with the Government throughout; because it was the Attorney-General who intervened in the printing industry case and elevated- the question of the 40-liour week, and, later, the' question of the basic wage] to a position which had: a general application to1 all union's coming within the ambit of. the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Further relaxation of those regulations were effected- in December' of last1 year' and March and April of this year, and the Government had been' active- in' seeking to get- rid ofl those regulations- in common with all other war emergency regulations. The Leader of the Opposition can rest assured that no unionist is under ,any misapprehension about the point: he raised. Regarding the difficulties which the Leader of the Opposition says might arise because fifteen conciliation commissioners may need to approach the' judge and' thus chit tei- up the court with work and' cause difficulties that will make for entanglement, I repeat the point I made a moment ago, that many matters before th'e conciliation commissioners will' not relate to the one aspect that is required' in the wage-pegging regulations, that is, where the rate of remuneration is affected. But. in any event, I point out' that throughout the war period when we had a spate of industrial unrest and more instances of industrial unrest than hitherto, the. Chief Judge, aided by eight commissioners, was able to cope with them. Frankly, f do' not expect that. there will.be any. greater difficulty under, the new proposals. It is obvious that- by the time this measure:is proclaimed and' conciliation, commissioners are set up and' allocated, their various duties, some reasonable time will elapse: Lam not- prepared, at this stage; because the matter has- not been considered, to forecast- whether, the wage pegging regulations will' still be in1 operation when this- measure comes,into force. That may, or' may not, be the position. ","N/A","COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL 1.947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

He says that th& conciliation commissioners- will 'be- handicapped- when dealing, mainly- with remuneration: I suggest that in' 99 per- cent, of the cases that will come before' the conciliationcommissioners the question of: remuneration will be included, because the basic wage, hours; remuneration >of female l a bour and - sick leave and holidays do not come within their jurisdiction. What are the fifteen conciliation commissioners going to- do? I anticipated that a- considerable amount' of work' would 'be given to' them, and that1 they- would be called upon to deal with hundreds of' cases. If their jurisdiction is limited there will' be chaos and confusion. So far as -lie wage pegging' regulations- are concerned, the committee must bear1 in mind that many of the serious strikes which have taken place during the last two years- have occurred because' of the Government's' policy with respect to wage-pegging. Those strikes have really been' a 'challenge to the Government; and it; is interesting to note that during that period the Government has been forced by political pressure' to appease and to retreat. It;is interesting -to read the comment of a well- known authority upon these wage-pegging' regulations, particu-la'rly: the- latest regulation, which places upon the Chief Judge the onus of deciding; more or 'less; the eco- nomic policy of the Government; l.l seems'- ludicrous that the Chief Judge should be obliged to make' that decision; but, under' this measure, there is no right, of appeal from the conciliation commissioners' decisions- to the Arbitration Court as a court, in spite of.' the fact: that' fifteen different opinions may he' given. The last1 absurdity- occurred' when Cabinet: shuffling out of its responsibility 'for economic policy, transferred to the' Chief Judge,' and in the' coal-mining industry to another' authority, the obligation to decide whether it would be- in the national interest to grant applications!for increases of wages. I should have thought; that the economy of th.ev country was the responsibility of the Government. The. Government created the wage-pegging regulations. That is the Government's own law; yet now, in effect, it says' to one judge of the Arbitration Court,. 'Will you please accept the responsibility for deciding when, and under what conditions, our own. law is to come into the matter.? ' That transfers to a judicial authority the whole of the Government's responsibility- for economicpolicy. It represents a complete abdication on the part of the Government.; and that abdication has accounted fbr practically' every strike which has occurred during the last twelve months: Honorable senators from South Australia will, be aware that during the last week steps were taken in a prominent trade union organization to bring, pressure to bear upon the Government to dismiss Chief Judge Drake-Brockman, because those unionists thought that it would be impossible for them to get all ' they, wanted while he. remained Chief Judge of the court. The law must be observed. The Government must govern. It cannot afford to appease. It cannot afford to continue its retreat from the wage-pegging regulations- whenever political pressure is brought to bear upon it. Even when this measure becomes law, it will not be possible to get quick decisions on matters affecting' wages because such decisions will need the approval of the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court, or, in the case of th'e coal industry, the chairman of the Joint Coal Board, to be effective. It would'be better' to' scrap the wage-pegging regulations and provide for the right of! appeal to the Arbitration Court. Th'e  Government itself and political leaders generally should do everything possible to preserve peace in industry by keeping as many cases as possible away from the Arbitration Court and from the conciliation commissioners. Let the employers and the employees get round a table and show a sane approach to the problem of ending the industrial civil war that is doing so much to-day to retard production, prevent a higher standard of living, and nullify our efforts to render humanitarian service to people overseas who are starving for our goods. We shall not improve the position by passing measures such as this; we shall only make it worse.

Thereafter, I shall take the honorable gentleman to task for several of his later comments which were unquestionably on the political level. Down the years the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court has been in the same responsible position as he is in to-day, and has had matters going to him, not only from Commonwealth and State tribunals, but also from every industrial authority in this land. The Chief Judge is not without assistance. 'He has his brother judges who are specialists in particular industries, and I have no doubt that he co-opts them for their assistance and advice. At all events, the Chief Judge has not been sending out any distress signals. I repeat that apart from the provision inserted by the April amendment, the honorable gentleman will find in section 18 of the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations, many matters relating to remuneration that can- be dealt with by an industrial authority, including a conciliation commissioner, without reference to the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court. There is, for instance, the much discussed formula relating to the increase of marginal rates by approximately 25 per cent.  I take strong exception to the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to what he described as the appeasing and retreating policy of the Government in relation to industrial un rest. His utterances were. unquestionably propaganda, and I regret that they should have been imported into a debate which I hoped would be confined to the bare merits of the legislation with which we are now concerned. Of course, the honorable gentleman has a perfect right to raise any matter he wishes, but I say to him at once that his statement that the Government has appeased and retreated is quite at issue with the truth. Apparently, the honorable senator has forgotten what happened a year ago last Christmas when there was an ironworkers' strike at Port Kembla. With Sydney, and most of* New South Wales lacking electric light, power, transport and so on, it would have been very easy for the Government to have intervened against constituted authority, but anybody who has studied industrial relations in the last year or two will realize that the Government made a stand against those who were seeking to destroy the .arbitration system - a stand that has been reinforced and has had a potent influence on the cleansing of destructive elements from the industrial sphere in New South Wales. In that regard, the Government has also given a lead to the moderates, if I may perhaps improperly refer to them as such - the ordinary trade unionists - to take similar action throughout the rest of the Commonwealth. There was no appeasement in relation to the recent Victorian metal trades strike that dragged on from October of last year until quite recently. Time and time again this Government has said, and has insisted that whoever is on strike must sooner or later come back to the processes of law, and of arbitration and conciliation. The Government has upheld those processes most strongly throughout its history. If that can be called retreating and appeasing, then the Government is guilty. Does the Leader of the . Opposition suggest that the Government should intervene in matters that are before the courts? If it were to do that, I have no doubt that the honorable gentleman would say immediately and with justification that it was interfering improperly. If the Leader of the Opposition ponders for a moment on the settlement of the metal trades strike in Victoria, he will realize that there was a triumph for the processes of conciliation because it was the conciliative processes of the court that settled that strike after the court had intervened by calling a compulsory conference. It showed too that the court had in its hands all the coercive powers that it required.

It is an expert tribunal with a very wide understanding. It also has complete tolerance. Down theyears, it has accumulated a great deal of wisdom and its judges, more than any one else in the community, realize how easy it is to throw a flame into a petrol tin and start a conflagration spreading from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. I do not propose to go into what might have influenced the judges in not acting sooner or more drastically, but I am prepared to pay them the tribute of saying that rhey acted wisely. I repeat that the initiative in industrial matters in this country has lain with this Government. On its own motion, it has modified the wage-pegging regulations. From the beginning, its object has been to get rid of emergency regulations as soon as possible. The Government has moved under its own power. It has listened to representations from all sections of the community, and it has made its own decisions.  I thought for a. moment from the way that the Leader of the Opposition was developing his argument that he was about to suggest that the wage-pegging regulations should be re-imposed. I do not know whether or not that was his intention, but apparently he is prepared now to concede the need for conciliation commissioners. He said. ' Letus appoint our conciliation commissioners'. That is the third voice with which he has spoken on that subject. Last Thursday he said that he wanted nothing to do with conciliation commissioners. He favoured the appointment of more Arbitration Court judges and the strengthening of the court. I invite the honorable senator to decide what he really does recommend to the Government. The Government has made up its mind, and is pursuing two courses to, an end that it believes will give a reasonable chance of industrial peace in this country. As one instance of Government initiative and activity, I point to the war-time referendum. In the war period and during the most disturbed industrial era that this country has ever known, the Government was prepared to take the full responsibility for industrial conditions. Would it have done that had it lacked courage? However, the people of the Commonwealth, acting on the advice of members of the Opposition amongst others, did not concede the powers that the Government sought. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, in view of what I have said, to let us hear no more of charges of appeasement and retreat, but. more credit for the results that have been achieved. .

So far as the Chambers of Manufactures are concerned, only one chamber - the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures - is registered as an 'organization' under the Arbitration Act.  This means that so far as manufacturers who are members of the various Chambers of Manufactures are concerned, only those in Victoria could be represented by ' a member or officer of an organization ' within the meaning of section 43r (1) (6) (ii) of the amendments to the Arbitration Bill. In other words, the bill contains no provision for representation of members of Chambers of Manufactures in all other States apart from by an employee of that manufacturer concerned. The general practice in the past has been to allow the representation of manufacturers in court and before conciliation commissioners by officers of State chambers, which are not registered organizations under the act, and we consider that it would cause great inconvenience and hardship to such manufacturers if the existing practice in this regard were discontinued.

The position has not altered substantially since ]!J04, when section 27 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act enacted that barristers and solicitors were prohibited from appearing before a. court or before a conciliation commissioner 'except by consent of all the parties or by leave of the President'. The provision in this bill is, therefore, substantially a reenactment of the relevant provision in the original act. In 1910 the section was altered and the prohibition was extended to include a paid agent. In 1938 a further provision was inserted stating that ' no party shall be represented by counsel or solicitor or 'by paid agent except by leave of the court'. In 1940 the section was further amended, the words ' or by ' being deleted and the word ' and ' inserted. That amendment was intended further to discourage legal representation. Honorable senators opposite know that barristers, solicitors, and paid agents have enjoyed an enormous practice in the Arbitration Court, and I have no doubt that, when major matters arise for determination involving fundamental principles, statements of account and matters traversing the economy of this country, employers and employees will still find it necessary to engage expert assistance. I emphasize the fact that professional representation has always been, possible with the consent of the parties and by leave of the court. So far as the court is concerned the position is not altered by the bill. Now that we are giving a new emphasis to conciliation we want to eliminate from that jurisdiction all elements of legal and tactical manoeuvring by persons retained to placate their clients rather than to conciliate the other party. The measure of efficiency that is applied to lawyers and professional advocates in a jurisdiction such as this is completely foreign to the spirit of conciliation, and f agree with what the Leader of the Opposition (Senator McLeay) said last year when he urged that it was desirable to bring employers and employees together. [ agreed with him then, I agreed with him the other day, and I agree with- him now. I think that it is a logical deduction from those premises to say : ' Let us eliminate all the people who are sent into the courts to fight on , bell alf of their clients, whether they be barrister, solicitor or paid agent of any kind, and let us bring the actual parties together '. If there is any. hope for conciliation that hope can be realized only in the way that the Leader of the Opposition himself suggested, namely, in an atmosphere where employer meets employee without formality, and where they may freely confer without the intervention of professional advocates, who measure their ability by how little they give away and how much they receive. That atmosphere is completely foreign to conciliation, as we. on this side of the chamber understand it, and we are adopting the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition that we should push everybody else out of the way so that we can bring face to face the employer and employee.  If I am not mistaken, it was the Leader of the Opposition who said, during the last few days, that there should b e a ' peace iri industry ' conference. He is reported as having importuned the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) to adopt the suggestion that was on the tapis some twelve months ago. If there is any value in that suggestion there is infinitely more in b ringing together the employer and employee in the very esta b lishment where a dispute occurs and in any particular sec tion of industry where trou b le develops. I have no dou b t that a 'peace in industry ' conference held on the' highest levels would achieve some good b ecause it would undou b tedly promulgate some sound principles; b ut the real work that has to b e done to achieve permanent peace in industry can b e accomplished only when employer and employee sit around a ta b le and discuss their difficulties informally and without recrimination. That is the keynote of the Government's policy in this matter. Whilst I accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that there should b e more conciliation in industry, I regret that I cannot accept his amendment, and 1 point out that in strict fact it is quite unnecessary. If he will refer to su b -para i of para b of su b -section 1 of proposed new section 43g he will see that it is provided that a party, not b eing an organization, may b e represented ' b y an employee of that party. The honora b le senator's amendment reads - ' including a person who is regularly employed as an industrial officer '. If such a person is regularly employed in any capacity, he is an employee.

In most cases employees who are- called upon to work overtime in this way do not, receive any extra wages.' Fearing dismissal if they claim overtime, they usually wait until they are dismissed or decide to leave before taking action to recover the extra money due to them. An employee might continue his employment for three or four years before getting an opportunity to claim overtime. I know of a man who worked overtime . for his employer, but received no payment because he was afraid to ask for it. Labour was not scarce at that time, and he feared losing his job. I told him to keep a record of the overtime that, he worked. This went on for two years, but as the limit for recovery was six months, he could only claim for that period. I am sure that the Minister for Health (Senator M.cKenna.) 'will give sympathetic consideration to this matter, because he agrees that twelve months is not long enough. In fact, two years is not long enough. In my view, no time limit should be specified.

An employee should have become thoroughly acquainted with the award under which he is working within twelve months; but .1 remind the committee that Commonwealth industrial inspectors, have been responsible for the recovery of huge amounts of wages consequent upon the flouting of awards by employers. At present the period of recovery is nine, months. This measure will extend it to twelve months', but as these abuses have occurred in the past, there is no reason to believe that they will not continue in the future, lt is most unjust to allow an employer who has flouted an award for say two years to enjoy the benefit of having underpaid an employee -for twelve months. The employee may be as much to Marne as the employer, but the deliberate flouting of the law is not fair to fellow employers and fellow employees. I believe therefore that some penalty should be imposed upon an employer who wilfully desregards an award. His obligation should not be discharged merely by making restitution of wages withheld for a period of twelve months. Senator LAMP (Tasmania) [8.26J.- I have been requested by the Launceston Trades Hall Council and the Hobart Trades Hall Council to protest against this provision. These organizations believe that the period allowed for recovery is too short because of the peculiar circumstances of industry in Tasmania. I have in mind a recent case in which an employee recovered £1.7 from an employer for back wages, whereas he- was actually entitled to more than £60. In the opinion ' of the two councils the present proposals are inadequate, and I ask that the matter be postponed to give the Government an opportunity to see whether the period cannot be increased to at least two years. Section 49 of the principal act provides; - ","N/A","COMMONWEALTH CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL 1.947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[34]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

So there is ample provision in the act to impose a heavy penalty on an employer who fails to carry out the terms of an award. The section that I have just quoted is also facilitating recovery under the proposed new sub-section of section 44which states - (3.) Where, in any proceedings against an employer before a Court specified in subsection (1.) of this section,it appears to the Count that an employee of that employer has not been paid an amount to which he is entitled under an order or award, that Court may order that the employer shall pay to the employee the amount of the underpayment but no order shall be made in respect of so much of the underpayment as relates to any period more than twelve months prior to the commencementof theproceedings.  The two points amount to this : Heavy penalties in respect of each week or each pay period of an award, may be imposed upon an employer who fails to make the payments, and in the course of the proceedings in which the employer is being prosecuted, the magistrate or the court may simultaneously order the payment of arrears up to twelve months only. I believe that this is a reasonable provision. It was thought to be so in 1930. As I have said, the Government has given mature consideration to this proposal, and it is because of strong and well supported representations that the period has been limited to twelve months. I argued quite strenuously in favour of a period of six years, but after hearing of the difficulties arising in the outback areas where it is not easy for a union representative to meet employees regularly, I am quite convinced that this proposal does real justice.

Will action be initiated by the union whose member is affected, by the inspectors, or by the Arbitration Court, to secure a penalty against an employer who deliberately flouts an award? In the past, awards have been deliberately flouted by employers and the unions whose members have been defrauded have had to , go to the Arbitration Court to recoverarrears of payments. In so doing, they have had to expend their funds and fight against strong opposition. In such instances, no penalties have been imposed upon the offending parties. They havebeencalled upon only to pay the money owing to their employees. I consider that' the use of the word ' may ' in the penalty provisions has allowed them to escape just punishment. This word gives the court discretion regarding the imposition of penalties. As a specific instance, I cite the timber workers' case.

It will not be competent for an arbitrator to interpret an award. Such questions must go to a court. That is provided throughout the bill. In the circumstances envisaged by the honorable senator, when an appeal or hearing is pending in a superior court as to the interpretation of a particular clause in an award and time is running out against men who are awaiting a decision, the men may protect their rights merely by issuing a complaint against their employer and letting it rest pending the pronouncement of the judicial body. Ti the interpretation given 'by the court is against their view, they may simply discontinue their action. It is very easy for men to take proceedings in a court of inferior jurisdiction. The mere lodging of a claim protects their rights, even should the delay in obtaining an interpretation from the superior court extend to two years. In view of the fact that appeals, even in relation to matters of interpretation, will in future be limited to the Arbitration Court-a court that. is skilled in that jurisdiction - I do not expect that there will be any long delays. Questions of interpretation arise when actions are brought in inferior courts for the recovery of wages, for breaches of awards and for 'offences against awards, and, as a result of this bill, appeals from such courts will be made direct to the Arbitration Court. Therefore, I do not expect any long delays in relation to interpretations. Howe ve] , should there be delay, the men may protect their interests as, I have explained.

Consider conditions in the engineering industry. In that industry there are firs-class machinists, second-class machinists and third-class machinists. The men who operate drilling machines are also classified in that way. Sometimes arguments occur as to whether certain work should be paid for at the rate provided for first-class machinists or at that provided for second-class machinists. Such disputes occur time after time. The margins between the various classifications are not very great. I cite a hypothetical case. A union secretary goes to an employer and says', ' The work that Jack Brown is doing should be paid for at the rate for first-class machinists '. The employer replies, 'No, I think it is secOnd-class machinists' work'. An argument develops. Does the Minister say that, in such an event, it is necessary to invoke all the machinery of the Arbitration Court in order to obtain a clear decision? I have strong faith in conciliation commissioners as opposed to judges. Generally speaking, judges know nothing about the details of a trade. My faith in conciliation commissioners depends upon the fact that they will have practical knowledge of particular industries, and that, because of their association with such industries,, they will be able to settle disputes of the character I have mentioned on the spot. Surely the parties will not have to go to the Arbitration Court to obtain an interpretation in such a dispute.

One of the most important amendments was made by the Scullin Governmentin 1930, after ith ad achieved a substantial victory at the polls. In spite of all that has been clone and all that the Government hopes for, something more is needed to bring to an end the industrialwarfare which the country is experiencing. In the last two years, Australia has lost through strikes andlockouts a splendid opportunity to increase its production, and gain overseas markets. It has lost a wonderful opportunity to improve its economic position. That is an opportunity which it never had before, and we have not made the best of it. Obviously, what happened after World War I. will recur. 'The present inflated priceswill deflate, and the markets whichwill beavailable to this country for the next few years will then be closed to us.I repeat what I said in 1945, namely, that every Minister and every member of thisParliament has a duty to give a lead to employers, employees and the people generally to achieve; peace in industry, and, as far as possible,keepdisputes away from the Arbitration Court and theproposed conciliationcommissioners.I do not say where the fault lies,but unless something isdone along the lines that I have indicated the great bulkof the people of this countrywill experience hardship before long. IregretthatLabour leaders have not seen fit to condemn the actions of those fanatics in the community who are causingso much trouble. The time is ripe for the members of all political parties to do some clear thinking and straight talking. A good deal of nonsense is talked about a shorter working week and lessened production, but these things can only lead to chaos. I do not say that the faults are all on one side. I believe that all sections of the community should use the opportunities available to them to improve industrial conditions. Employers, as well as employees, must do their part to avoid the troubles which, unfortunately, seem to occur almost from day to day. The present-state of affairs is unfair to ex-servicemen requiring homes andfarms. It is an insultto the intelligence of the people that practically a state of civil war should exist. I am glad that the Prime Minister . (Mr. Chifley)has saidthathe is prepared to convene a conference of employers and employees with a view to securing , peace in industry.
