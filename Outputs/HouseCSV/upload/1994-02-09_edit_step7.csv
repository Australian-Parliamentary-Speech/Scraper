The seat of Werriwa has produced for the Labor Party some very great figures over the years—in recent history, of course, Gough Whitlam and John Kerin—and Mark Latham follows this very high tradition in this electorate for the Labor Party.  What is important about his election is the Labor Party's renewal. The Labor Party has continued to change and renew itself in office. This is always difficult for a major party to do because most parties refurbish themselves—change their membership, change their personnel—out of office. The Labor Party is doing it in office. The usefulness and energy of the government is being compounded by the change from experienced members who have served as ministers, many of them for a decade, and then gone back to private life, to people of similar calibre who, with experience, will serve the country, the government and the Labor Party well. I congratulate Mark Latham, his family and his supporters on a very strong and convincing victory.","N/A","MEMBER SWORN","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","10","0","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The bill will give effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the chemical weapons convention, CWC, and will provide a legislative basis for its national implementation. Australia signed the convention when it opened for signature on 13 January 1993 and will ratify the convention after the enactment of this legislation. The convention will enter into force 180 days after the 65th ratification, but not before 13 January 1995. Although only four of the 154 signatories have yet ratified the convention, many others are preparing for ratification and implementation.  Australia was instrumental in accelerating the final negotiations and bringing negotiations on the convention to a successful conclusion in 1992. That event marked a significant turning point in international efforts to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. For the first time the global community agreed to ban completely a whole category of weapons of mass destruction, require the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons and their production facilities, and provide an effective mechanism to verify compliance with the convention. The convention is the most intrusive global instrument yet developed through the United Nations system, not only requiring state parties to make annual declarations on the production and use of certain chemicals but also to subject facilities which produce or use those chemicals above specified thresholds to routine inspections by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the CWC's permanent body in the Hague. Any state party also has the right to request the organisation to conduct a challenge inspection of any place within the territory of another state party if it has reason to suspect that the other state party may not be acting in compliance with the convention. A state party has no right to refuse such an inspection. The intrusive nature of the convention's verification regime is essential for building confidence in the convention itself. It will provide a means by which allegations or suspicions of non-compliance on the part of a state party may be clarified. Where suspicions are not clarified, supplier countries have resorted to denying those engaged in suspicious activities with precursor chemicals and equipment and technology needed to develop a chemical weapons program, even though such goods may be for quite legitimate purposes. The entry into force of the convention and wide adherence to it will benefit international trade in chemicals and chemical technology. This has been a factor in the strong support given to the convention by Australian and international chemical industry organisations. As required by the convention, this bill, in clause 12, makes it an offence to develop, acquire, stockpile, retain, transfer or use chemical weapons. It will also be an offence for anyone in Australia or the external territories, or any Australian citizen overseas, to assist, encourage or induce any other person to engage in any activity prohibited to a state party under the convention. The chemicals which pose the greatest risk to the convention are contained in three schedules attached to the convention. Facilities which produce or use these chemicals above specified thresholds have to be declared to the organisation. The facility operators will also be required under this legislation to provide information for Australia's declarations to the organisation and will be subject to routine inspection by the organisation. Access to facilities for national or international compliance inspection purposes will be effected by consent of the operator or by a warrant issued by a magistrate. Trial inspections held in Australia and overseas have shown that such inspections cause minimal disruption to commercial operations. Both the convention and this legislation contain confidentiality provisions to protect the integrity of information gained during any activity related to the convention. The bill also covers the convention's provision for managed access by international inspectors to facilities where there is sensitive chemical technology or other information unrelated to chemical weapons. Managed access does not weaken the inspection process but is an added measure of protection for the confidentiality of commercial or national security interests. The bill provides for a permit system for declared facilities producing or using scheduled chemicals. The permit system will be the legal framework to facilitate the collection of information for Australia's annual declarations. The permits will be issued by the minister and may be renewed, transferred or revoked. Conditions relating to Australia's obligations under the convention will be attached to the permits. Ministerial decisions relating to permits will be subject to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The permit system will be administered by the Chemical Weapons Convention Office, which will be established as a non-statutory unit within an organisation in the minister's portfolio. The office will engage national inspectors, who will have inspection powers to verify that declared facilities are complying with the legislation. Other chemical production facilities, which produce un-scheduled discrete organic chemicals above specified thresholds, will be required to notify the chemical weapons convention office at the end of each year of their production levels of those chemicals, for inclusion in Australia's annual declarations. These facilities were included in the convention's verification regime because they are capable of being used in support of a chemical weapons production program. They will not, however, be subject to international inspection for at least three years after the convention's entry into force. Controls on the import and export of certain chemicals as required by the convention will be implemented by amendment of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. The proposed national controls contained in this bill to implement the convention, including its verification regime, are similar to those currently administered by the Australian Safeguards Office under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. The convention underwent a 20-year period of gestation. In the changing world resulting from the end of the Cold War, it is important for the convention to enter into force as early as possible, and that as many states as possible be encouraged to ratify it before that time. With the introduction of this legislation into the parliament, Australia will be setting an example for other states, particularly those in our region, to follow. We are also continuing to assist regional states, under the chemical weapons regional initiative, with their implementation of the convention. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

It is impossible to get a speech out of him without it being written for him.  Just the other day, first up in question time, I asked a question of the minister responsible for this piece of legislation, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), on Bosnia—a fairly important matter. The minister was not even in the chamber. No explanation was given; he just arrived later. He had a bit of a long lunch, I suspect. Now, when we are dealing with the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill, to which we are giving our full support, some rambling junior minister wanders into the place and reads a speech that has been previously circulated by the minister responsible in this House. No explanation is given as to why the man who takes the car, the money, the job and the title is not here to introduce the bill or speak to the second reading. It is a touch of disdain. The sanctimonious nonsense with which those opposite go on from time to time about their pride and their precious Labor Party does not fit in with the way they conduct themselves in this parliament. If this legislation is so important—and it is—then the bloke who is paid to look after it ought to be here to explain to the people here and to the nation why the legislation is inherently important and why the government has worked to it. Twice in this week the shamble occurred where the guy responsible could not even be bothered attending the parliament. It is a pity that, when debating a piece of legislation that I regard as fundamentally important—the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill—the minister who is charged with its responsibility in the parliament could not even get out of bed to be here by 10 o'clock. He could not even get himself into the parliament by 2 o'clock to answer a question on Bosnia. As I said earlier, the coalition fully supports the bill. This bill rightly makes it an offence in Australia to develop, acquire, stockpile, retain, transfer or use chemical weapons, or to assist, encourage or induce any other person to do so. It is a worthy measure. Passage of this legislation will provide a basis for implementation of Australia's obligations under the chemical weapons convention, the first treaty in history to ban an entire category of weapons which surely figure among the most abhorrent and horrific of all weapons of mass destruction. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction—be they chemical, biological or nuclear—and the missile systems capable of delivering such weapons has been one of the most threatening developments of our age. Unlike nuclear and biological weapons, chemical weapons have actually been used in very recent times. Their mass casualty and disfiguration effects have made them particularly feared, and concerns that any country may have embarked on a chemical weapons program have encouraged others to consider the development of matching deterrent capabilities. The need for a global convention to counter this risk was formally recognised by the United Nations in 1968, but unfortunately negotiations were slowed down by the obvious constraint of the Cold War. The achievement now embodied in this convention gives us renewed hope and reassurance for our future security. The convention had its genesis in the UN conference on disarmament, aiming to improve upon the 1925 Geneva protocol which outlawed the use but not the possession of chemical weapons. The limits and inadequacies of the Geneva protocol were vividly demonstrated by Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the 1980s, both against Iran and its own Kurdish population. The protocol also did nothing to prevent the ongoing stockpiling by the two super powers of tens of thousands of tonnes of nerve gas and mustard gas, nor to prevent the implicit threat of destabilisation that this entailed for international security. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the signing of the chemical weapons convention in January 1993 represented a milestone in global disarmament efforts. It is my hope and the hope of the opposition that, when the convention enters into force, it will be able to oversight eventual complete elimination of chemical weapons. That is our hope. But there are very considerable tasks ahead, including in the lead-up to ratification of the convention and its entry into force. I will return to these issues in a moment. First, the coalition would like to record its recognition of the constructive contribution that the government has made in bringing to fruition the difficult and protracted negotiations towards the convention. I also wish to mention the government's successful efforts to obtain widespread support for the convention within our neighbouring region—in South-East Asia and the Pacific. I would like to lend support to the government's efforts, which I hope are ongoing, to discuss with other signatory countries in the region all aspects of national implementation of these obligations. That is all the more reason why the minister who is answerable in this House ought to be here to hear the opposition say that we agree with what the government has done. In this instance we congratulate the government for the work it has put in to draw the efforts from so many other countries and for the work it is doing in the region, but the minister is not here. The fact is that Australia was at the forefront throughout the negotiations for the convention. It was not just this government that was involved and that is why we should say Australia. This government indicated publicly its determination to work to bring this convention to fruition and for that it is deserving of congratulation. Australia—this government and others—has been at the forefront in debating the issue for many years and now we are at the forefront in debating the issue in the parliament today. The cross-party support that this legislation has received in the parliament means we will be amongst the first of the nations signing to actually ratify the convention. Hopefully, this will set an example throughout the region. I would like to add my voice to those urging our regional neighbours, and indeed all other signatories, to ratify the convention at the earliest possible opportunity. It is also my hope that global disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention can provide an overarching global umbrella under which regional security talks, which are now emerging as a new focus of diplomatic efforts in the Asia-Pacific region, can take firmer root. South-East Asia is currently free of chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. It should remain a key element of Australian foreign policy to keep weapons of mass destruction out of our region. This is essential to maintaining a positive security environment for Australia. In this sense, ratification of the chemical weapons convention by all signatory countries in the region should help clarify and simplify the task of establishing a workable and productive regional security dialogue. I also want to acknowledge the constructive contribution which has been made by the Australian chemical industry. The bill necessarily implies, and provides for explicitly and implicitly, some new controls on, and hence some new inconvenience for, a number of Australian chemical companies. I hope, of course, that the government will be conscious, in implementing the permit system under the legislation, of the need to avoid any unnecessary burden on industry. But the industry itself has been firmly supportive of Australia's participation in the chemical weapons convention and has, I believe, displayed a genuine sense of proper corporate social responsibility. This cooperative stance deserves the full recognition of the parliament. I also note that entry into force of the convention has some potential to bring improved predictability to international trade in chemicals, because obviously the larger the number of ratifying countries, the fewer the prohibitions which will be required on trade with non-signatory countries. The all-embracing nature of the chemical weapons convention has caused it to be described as a `model'. It is, nevertheless, imperfect. It is not my intention to be critical of the convention—I have already indicated the opposition's support for it and my congratulations on the effort that has gone into it on Australia's behalf—but it would be foolhardy not to understand and accept its limitations and to work for improvement. The convention has received widespread support. To date, 154 countries have signed the convention. But some countries have not signed, and some of those countries that have not signed are unlikely to sign. The coalition is especially concerned about the lack of support the convention is receiving from a certain handful of countries which would seem to be among those most likely to be interested in possessing, or which indeed already possess, chemical weapons. About 20 states are believed to possess chemical weapons. Many of them will not sign or ratify the convention. The coalition is concerned that a number of Middle Eastern nations have not signed. The Middle East is the only certain theatre since World War II where chemical weapons have been used. So this omission is obviously unsettling. Diplomatic efforts need to be focused urgently on ensuring a demonstrated commitment to the convention. I emphasise that chemical weapons are not difficult to make, nor are they difficult to hide. Iraq's chemical weapons program, discovered after the Gulf War, demonstrates the ease with which states can develop and, indeed, conceal huge chemical weapons arsenals. Iraq has declared, for example, 140,000 chemical weapons, 600 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent and 3,500 tonnes of precursor stock to United Nations inspectors, but it remains unclear whether this represents the total stockpile. Without the cooperation of the country concerned, it will be very difficult to ensure compliance with the convention, whether that country is a signatory or not. There are limits, therefore, to the enforcement of the convention. In my view, one of the major challenges for the international community will be to find new solutions to encourage and enforce compliance by states unwilling to conform with the spirit of this or, indeed, other conventions. I also want to look very briefly at verification. The success of the convention will be determined by the effectiveness and the workability of its inspection and verification regime. The verification provisions are certainly not foolproof. The convention provides for two verification regimes: firstly, a routine monitoring regime involving annual declarations and systematic inspections and, secondly, a challenge inspection regime whereby any state can request an inspection of any facility in any other state. Both regimes are likely to be limited in their effectiveness and dependent, of course, upon state cooperation. The enormity of the problem the world community is now witnessing in North Korea, which is refusing to allow adequate International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities, despite the fact that it is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, is a very vivid illustration of the likely difficulties which lie ahead. The coalition has also expressed concern regarding the fact that under article 11 9 (d) chemical riot control agents are not banned by the convention if used for `law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes'. There is clearly some potential ambiguity about the interpretation which may be given to this exception, particularly where domestic minority groups are involved. It is not hard to imagine situations where the distinction between `riot control' and `offensive action' could be very difficult to make. This ambiguity could open up a possible loophole in enforcing the terms of the convention. But I earnestly hope that the spirit of the convention can be interpreted to ensure the proper protection of minority groups vulnerable to human rights abuse. But clearly this could be fraught with danger. The coalition would urge that every effort be made bilaterally and multilaterally to overcome the shortcomings of the convention. Ratification of the convention and its entry into force will clearly not represent an end in itself. There is always that danger after long and protracted negotiations; one gets a warm inner glow and breathes a sigh of relief that one has been able to achieve the convention—and it is a significant achievement. Countries congratulate themselves on the success of their diplomatic efforts and seek to sell their achievement at home and trumpet it abroad. The dangers that still exist are overlooked in the celebratory atmosphere following the signing by so many countries of the convention. The ratification of the convention and its entry into force will not represent an end in itself. The international community will need to make strenuous ongoing efforts to ensure that such weapons are effectively outlawed and eliminated. So we on this side of the House will maintain our long running support for the elimination of these and other weapons, support which was given in government, support which is given in opposition. We are pleased to support the bill which tackles this whole problem of weapons of mass destruction and which is directed towards the elimination of chemical weapons, the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","18","0","Mr FERGUSON","8T4","(Reid)","ALP","N/A","598","—The signature in January 1993 in Paris of the chemical weapons convention signalled a very important point in a process that, as the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) indicated, can be traced to the 1925 Geneva protocol. As he firmly indicated, this country, with the support of the opposition throughout, has played a major role in the convention in later years.  Probably the one thing that intensifies the interest on both sides of the House in this matter is the way in which these chemical weapons are often used against fairly isolated communities in countries that do not have major international media coverage of their internal affairs. I think the honourable member's comments on article 11 9 (d) concerning the possible continued use of these chemicals for riot control within some countries give some indication of our long-term concerns with this matter. He alluded to the role of the Iraqi government in their use against the Kurds and also in the war with Iran. It is quite ironic that last year a BBC program revealed, probably for the first time internationally, the use by the British government of these weapons against the Kurds in what is now northern Iraq early this century. It has been subsequently shown that for quite a period the RAF dropped the precursors of some of the current weapons on Kurdish villages. Possibly there are some indications of that in parts of the hinterland of Afghanistan and Pakistan. We now have 20 countries that have either obtained or are on the verge of obtaining a fair degree of competence in chemical weapons. They can be used and have been used against civilian populations; they are not very discriminatory. I think that is what has intensified the concerns of both sides of politics, and it has also prompted the minor parties to make speeches in the Senate about this matter. By the 31st of last month, 150 countries had signed the convention. But, as has been indicated by a number of speakers, it is ratification that is crucial. There is a firm requirement that 65 countries ratify in the period to July 1994 for the operation of this measure in the real sense so that it can operate by January 1995. I join with the previous speakers in this House and the government, Green and Democrat speakers in the other house in calling on the government to ensure that it does take a series of measures to pressure countries, particularly in our region, to ratify. All of this work which was done for the 1972 convention on the prohibition and development, production and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons, the 1974 USSR agreement to hold bilateral talks, the 1984 US draft treaty for the systematic on-site inspection of facilities and, of course, the beginning in 1985 of a very real Australian effort on this matter, will be lost if we do not manage to pressure 65 countries to ratify this measure. The Australian effort has been alluded to earlier. There has been a very real effort by representatives of this country at ministerial and departmental levels. There was the beginning of an actual Australian group, the August 1989 regional workshop of South-East Asian and South Pacific nations, and a month later the forum in Canberra which, as a previous speaker indicated, was the beginning of a very real effort to involve the international chemical industry. This effort, of course, was a very important initiative: firstly, it cemented interest in our region; secondly, it got those countries on board to do something—to sign and be part of the effort; and, thirdly, it got the chemical industry for the first time to recognise that it had to take a stand. That was followed very soon after by the first affirmation by the international chemical industry, with its monetary interest in this field, to say, `Yes, something is wrong, we have to take a stand and we have to be socially responsible'. So the Australian effort was important, it has been perceived as such and it is a great credit to this country. There are very significant problems. Some of those relate to monitoring and verification. Equally, there is the problem of destruction. That has been of some interest to the Australian electorate and the Australian parliament because of the scrutiny of the possible impact on the Oceania region of the incineration and destruction of weapons on Johnson Atoll—717 kilometres from Hawaii. Commitments were made—I am not sure what the situation is today—when this matter was on the agenda in Australian politics that the United States, to ensure that pressure was taken off the Johnson Atoll and our region, would construct a significant number of destruction sites within the United States. There are very real problems about the way in which destruction will occur. In the United States there have been changes to the process of dealing with destruction. Quite frankly, the situation in Russia is even more alarming. Up to 1972, the United States resorted to ocean dumping and open pit incinerators. From 1972 to 1976, it reverted to chemical neutralisation, particularly in Colorado, but it was found that a number of ancillary technologies were needed. The one technology could not handle all chemicals, particularly mustard gas. In 1982 the United States started on a process of high temperature incineration. It has to deal with 29 different types of munitions in a three million item inventory. That has led to concerns from a number of environmental organisations and intense division with various states trying to restrict the movement of these items across the United States. A 1988 US army environmental impact statement noted that transportation was `formidable, complex and an uncertain task'. For instance, the site in Kentucky, which includes only 1.6 per cent of the US holdings, would require 1,500 flights from Kentucky to Utah and the construction of four specially designed trains each with 50 cars. As I say, that is to move only 1.6 per cent of the total holdings for destruction. In 1990, Louis Ember outlined the very real problems in destruction when he stated:","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That problem is even more serious in the former Soviet Union where, for the first time, a fairly autocratic governmental structure has had to deal with this novel problem of resident action, environmental groups and public scrutiny. The Chapayevsk institution was sited in an area where there were, within a 100 kilometre circle, 2.5 million people. This led to a 34-day protest. As I say, this was a very novel problem for the government authorities to deal with, to the point where they had to close the institution.  Russia has a very questionable level of technology. Some of the methods that it says it is using are very much questioned by US experts. Admittedly, there has been financial assistance to the Russian government, particularly by the US and Germany, to try to do something about this problem, but some of the proposals to turn these weapons into more environmentally suitable products, such as arsenic that can be used as an alternative, are very much questioned. Russia is going down the chemical neutralisation line, as opposed to America's emphasis on high temperature incineration. But in both countries there is a very real worry that, whilst we might get rid of the chemical weapons problem, the process of destruction could be very dangerous to civilian populations. There has also been a very real debate with the military/industrial complex questioning how fast it should go down this road. We have seen over the last year or so the continued authority of that kind of complex within that political system. These are matters that we should monitor. Australia should be prepared to assist those countries that do not have the expertise or the financial means to enforce the provisions that are required. I think that is something that should be borne in mind. That point was summarised by Amy Smithson in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists .

I think we have to be realistic and say that, unlike in other treaties of this sort, there are no first- and second-class international citizens. It applies to those that currently have possession of, those that are developing and those that have given no thought whatsoever to going down the road of chemical weapons. So it is novel in that way. It is a worthwhile initiative. For all of the very correct criticisms, I think we again have to acknowledge that it is a very worthwhile measure in which Australia has taken a very strong lead.  We are talking about a number of difficulties, most particularly the question of challenge inspections. There has been a lessening of determination because of negotiations between major powers and there has been a lessening of the degree to which those requesting inspections can really come down with a hammer on the country they seek access to. There has been an increase in the amount of notice required, which gives an advantage to the country that could be trying to protect its sites. There has also been a weakening of the negotiation process so that individual sites, factories or institutions can be divided up and the country in which they exist can say, `You can only look at this section over here'. Those kinds of negotiations decrease the power of monitoring and international surveillance. For all the criticisms, for all the concerns and for all the areas in which we must continue to press for improvements, the situation is best summarised by Jay Brin in the April 1993 Technology Review .

There are things we have to drive forward with, but it is a major step forward. The requirement that countries importing chemicals indicate for three years after it comes into operation the uses to which those chemicals are put and, eventually, the impact of actual restrictions on exports to those countries will of course create international pressure.  Another matter alluded to is the question of the Middle East and the way in which a number of the Arab League countries are tying their involvement in this convention to the question of Israel and its nuclear capacity. Whilst I think we would all be supportive in ensuring that the Israelis come to the table on that issue, it should not be used as an excuse by a minority of Arab countries to refuse signatory status to this convention. A number of Arab countries have already broken the line, not only in North Africa but also in the Middle East, and they have signed the convention. Unfortunately, there must be a degree of cynicism about some of the non-signatories. As has been stated earlier, they tend to be, coincidentally, countries where there is concern about the use and the possible production of chemical weapons. Let us hope that international efforts will persuade those countries, particularly in the context of the current peace negotiations, that nothing is being gained for their international image by their consistent refusal to sign. I commend the legislation to the House.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/para[24]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","20","0","Mrs GALLUS","CU4","(Hindmarsh)","LP","N/A","601","—The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table, commented on the speech of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson). The contributions of the honourable member for Reid are always good. It is always interesting to hear him because he has a particular interest in the field of peace and associated areas. His speech came in nice contradiction to the speech made by the minister who has been given responsibility for the passage of the legislation through the House.  I echo the words of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). He commented on the way this House has been treated. This bill has been presented extraordinarily quickly. The minister who has responsibility for its passage was not here and it has been handled by the Minister for Justice, who is not responsible for this bill but was simply on House duty and would have been responsible for whatever bill came before the House. As the honourable member for Kooyong said, it is a reflection of this government's absolute contempt for this House that this has now become a matter of course. As has been noted by previous speakers, this bill gives effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the chemical weapons convention and provides a legislative basis for its national implementation. This is quite a momentous bill. It is probably a reflection on this parliament that there are only six speakers listed for debate—three on either side of the House. The ramifications of the convention are global and extend not only over space but also over time. This is the first convention that bans a whole class of chemical weapons. It is a first in many respects. The convention takes on enormous details of verification. It has been compared in many ways to the convention on biological weapons but, as the honourable member for Reid has said, that did not have that wide expanse of verification. This bill is a landmark in the world history of weapons. It is sad that there are only three people on either side of the House here today to acknowledge this momentous event. Although chemical weapons cannot inflict the extent of damage of nuclear weapons, or even some more conventional weapons, they have always created fear and loathing amongst everyone generally, especially those who have ever been under attack. They have been called the poor man's atomic bomb. Part of the horror they engender is that they cannot be seen. I remember stories from the First World War of the fear of people not knowing whether gas bombs had been used and when the gas was coming towards them. This convention prohibits not only the production but also the acquisition, stockpiling, transfer, use and military preparation for use of chemical weapons, as well as assistance to anyone involved in prohibited activities. It is the first treaty ever to ban an entire class of weaponry and to provide adequate means for verifying such a ban. As I have already commented, it is the world's second true global disarmament treaty, the first being the 1972 biological weapons treaty. The definition of chemical weapon is extremely wide and includes herbicides, if they cause severe or long lasting effects, as a weapon of war. Tear gas is also banned as a method of warfare but not, as the honourable member for Kooyong noted, as a method of riot control. Currently only Russia, the USA and Iraq admit to the possession of chemical weapons. Of these three countries, only Iraq has not signed the convention. It is interesting to note that several states suspected of possessing chemical stockpiles have signed, including China, Iran, Vietnam, Israel, South Korea, Myanmar, India and Pakistan. The first recorded attack by a chemical weapon occurred on 22 April 1915 in Ypres in Belgium by the German army. Mustard gas was one of the horrors of the First World War. As a child, I can still remember the stories that ex-servicemen told me about the First World War. Many of those stories concerned the fear they had of gas canisters coming towards them. I suspect that many people in this House have had similar experiences. Exposure to mustard vapour can cause eye and respiratory damage and skin burns. Other chemicals that have been used include Sarin, known as GB, and VX nerve agents. Since the First World War there have been other allegations about the use of chemical weapons. In 1951 the US was accused by China of using chemical weapons in the Korean War. In 1980 the Soviets alleged that the Vietnamese were using them in South-East Asia and Africa. More recently, there have been allegations that Iraq used chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war. It is equally concerning, but from a different aspect, that Iraq has also been accused of using chemical weapons against its own citizens, the Kurds. There would not be anybody in this House who did not feel absolute revulsion for a country that could use such a weapon against its own citizens. It is also interesting to note that in the 1980s the US Congress was still approving funding for the binary chemicals program. Binary chemicals require two chemicals to come together to make one lethal concoction. In 1982 President Reagan certified to Congress that binary chemical weapons were in the national interest of the United States. However, at that time, the US was already engaged in bilateral talks with the USSR on the cessation of the stockpiling of such weapons. The Geneva convention of 17 June 1925 represented the first major step taken towards stopping the use of chemical weapons, which I think has already been mentioned by the honourable member for Reid and the honourable member for Kooyong. The Geneva convention prohibited the use but, as has been pointed out, not the stockpiling of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, as well as bacteriological methods of warfare. It was not until the 1970s that the USSR and the US agreed to hold bilateral talks in an effort to bring about the prohibition of chemical weapons. Multilateral talks between nations started in the 1980s. Since then the success of the negotiations has waxed and waned, with Australia taking an important role at one period when the impetus seemed to be lost. The role of Australia has been acknowledged by those involved with the convention. Senator Gareth Evans, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, was a significant contributor to the process, which has been acknowledged by the honourable member for Kooyong. His role stands in contrast to the lack of interest shown by the government in putting this legislation through the House today. It is a pity that we have not seen more of this matter reported in the press because it is one of the major events to have happened in recent times. As the honourable member for Reid has stated, there are problems—not with the convention itself but with the enormous stockpiles of weapons. One of my interests is the environmental considerations, which have also been mentioned by the honourable member for Reid. Although it is taken as written that it is good to get rid of these weapons, the question arises of the environmental consequences of the two methods of disposal. One method is chemical neutralisation and the other is incineration. Chemical neutralisation involves mixing the chemicals with sodium hydroxide. One of the problems associated with this is that it increases the size of the waste something like four-fold to leave an extremely toxic sludge. If we take the amount of chemicals that are already stockpiled, multiply it by four and look at the chemical sludge that is left, we can see the environmental aspects and problems associated with what to do with the sludge. The alternative method is incineration. As the honourable member for Reid has said, this has raised concerns as to what happens to the gases that escape from the incineration. There is particular fear about dioxin entering the atmosphere. The US army has decided for various reasons that incineration should take place in situ, where the chemicals are already stored, partly because of the problems that would occur in transporting them. Not surprisingly, the people who live in the areas where incineration is likely to take place will not be all that thrilled to see those chemicals incinerated anywhere near where they live. It is another symbol of the NIMBY syndrome, but one that I suspect is highly justified. Were I in a country town or in any location where the army was about to incinerate weapons of chemical warfare, I too would probably raise my voice to protest concern for the health of my family and my children. The problem remains that these chemicals have to be destroyed. Because of the nature of the neutralisation process, incineration probably will be the preferred method. It will not be a cheap method. The estimated cost to the United States is $8 billion. The estimated cost for the destruction of these weapons in Russia is $10 billion. Because of the economic situation in Russia, it seems that the United States will have to provide assistance to help it get rid of those weapons. That is another financial consequence that the people of the United States are not very happy to wear, but one that I feel they will have to because, whatever else happens in this world, it is absolutely essential that we do get rid of all those weapons of chemical warfare. I hope that those countries which have not signed the convention or have indicated that they will not sign it will change their minds and that the verification process will be as extensive as it has been mooted to be in the convention. I hope that it does not become a case of all the good guys signing the convention, leaving those people who have not signed the convention with free rein to indulge in chemical weapons. Hopefully, the parts of those conventions that relate to the chemical industry will act in such a way as to make it almost impossible—hopefully totally impossible—for other countries to continue in the manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons. I join with the honourable member for Kooyong in giving total support to this bill.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I said that he should be addressing the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill and he then had a go at me. He thought that my having the temerity to actually interject was not right. Maybe he was upset because I had beaten a couple of his mates, Mr Tom Warwick and Mr Frank Ford, in election campaigns of the past. I understand why the honourable member for Kooyong feels this way. I feel sorry for him and his party. Once again they have been frustrated; they lost the election. The Liberal Party is naturally tearing itself apart because of this lack of winning, because it has no policies, and because it backs losers all the time. I can appreciate his frustration, but I do feel a bit sorry for him. We only have to look at today's Canberra Times to see that all the Libs are doing is making trivial personal attacks on people. Even members of the National Party are getting upset with them.  However, I will speak to the bill. I would like to congratulate Senator Gareth Evans and those dedicated members of foreign affairs who have taken part in these negotiations. For many years they have been working on this and we should all feel very proud of what they have done for our nation. Once again Australia and its officials, led by the Labor government, have achieved a result far beyond what even they believed they could do. The Australian Labor government has, on the world scene, had a huge influence on many decisions. A few decisions that we were involved include GATT, the saving of Antarctica, greenhouse gases, the changing scene in Cambodia, and of course the chemical weapons convention. All of these decisions would not have come about except for the influence that we—the Labor government—have had on the officials in the various departments, and the work that they have done over many years to bring all these things to fruition. I believe that Senator Evans summed up the issue of chemical weapons very well in his second reading speech.

The history of the use of chemical weapons certainly generates feelings of great horror and this may make more effective a terrorist use of, or threat to use, chemical weapons.  Chemical warfare is about as old as warfare itself. In the fifth century BC, for example, sulfur fumes were used in Greece, and toxic smokes were described in early Indian and Chinese literature. Arsenic and other poisonous gases were used in the Middle Ages. But chemical warfare as we know it dates from the First World War. During that war, at least 45 chemical warfare agents were used by both sides. A total of 100 million kilograms of chemicals were used—mainly chlorine, phosgene and mustard gas. They killed 100,000 people and injured another million or so. Serious after-effects, including blindness, tuberculosis, lung cancer and bronchitis, afflicted the survivors, often for the rest of their lives. I can remember that, when I was a child during the Second World War, we had a shelter in our backyard in Hawthorn. I can still recall training to put on my gasmask, because we were expecting some sort of attack in Melbourne. Thankfully it was never used but I often wonder what would have happened if our opponents had used this cheap weapon on Australia. Chemical weapons were used by the Italians against the Ethiopians in 1935-36 and Japan used them against the Chinese between 1937 and 1945. During the Second World War, Hitler's Germany gassed millions of Jews in concentration camps. We also have the latest examples in Iraq and Iran. Iraq used chemical weapons against the Kurdish civilians, most notably at Halabja in March 1988, when about 5,000 Kurds died and 7,000 were injured. Apart from these major uses of chemical weapons there have been many stories of relatively minor uses. In April 1989, for example, the Soviet police used chloracetophenone, or CN, against demonstrators in Georgia, causing some deaths and injuries. Various types of chemical weapons have been made and used, and I will inform the House of a few of those weapons and what they can do. A binary chemical weapon, which has already been mentioned, is one in which two chemicals are combined. On their own, neither is very poisonous but when they are mixed together they produce a nerve gas. Isopropanol and methylphosphonyl difluoride, for example, are chemical components of a US binary weapon used in 155-millimetre artillery shells. The nerve gas they produce is sarin. In a binary weapon, the two chemicals are kept separate until the munition is fired. When this happens, the chemicals are mixed together so when the munition hits a target an aerosol cloud of nerve gas is produced. The military wants the new binary weapons because they are said to be very easy to store and they are safer. There is considerable concern about the rate at which countries are acquiring chemical weapons. The fact that there was very little international criticism of Iraq—the main culprit—for using chemical weapons in the Gulf War has been noted by all countries. The lack of criticism was all the more serious because the use of chemical weapons is without doubt a blatant violation of international law. Both Iraq and Iran were parties to the 1925 Geneva protocol prohibiting the use of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and bacteriological methods of warfare. There are strong reasons to believe that some Middle East countries other than Iraq possess chemical weapons: namely, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Libya and Syria. African countries suspected of possessing chemical weapons include Angola, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Africa and Sudan; Asian countries include Afghanistan, Burma, India, North Korea, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam; and Latin American countries include Argentina, Chile, Cuba and El Salvador. These weapons are still there. Hopefully many of these countries will sign this protocol, which will bring about the removal and destruction of these chemical weapons. There are five main categories of chemical warfare agents—disabling, choking, blister, blood and nerve agents. I would like to put on the record what these particular categories of chemical agents do. Incapacitating agents are mainly used by the police and other forces for riot control. The main effect of these compounds is that they induce violent vomiting. The choking agents attack the respiratory tract and make the membranes swell and the lungs fill with fluid. The victim actually drowns. Survivors normally suffer chronic breathing problems. Blister agents produce large water blisters on exposed skin which heal slowly and may become infected. These agents may also damage the eyes, blood cells and the respiratory tract. Blood agents are absorbed into the body by breathing. They kill by entering the bloodstream and, by attacking an enzyme, prevent the synthesis molecules from being used by the body as an energy source. This causes vital organs to cease functioning. There are two main groups of nerve gases: the G-agents and the V-agents. The G-agents are non-persistent and cause death mainly by inhalation. The V-agents are very persistent and can be absorbed through the skin. These gases are now available. They can be made very easily by any chemist or, so I have been told, anyone with a bit of chemical knowledge. The compounds for the ingredients are available. While the compounds that make up these gases and chemical groupings cannot be bought anywhere, they can be bought fairly easily. Nerve gas will attack the nervous system within minutes of exposure. Symptoms of increasingly severe damage to the nervous system will occur. These effects occur because nerve gases, like many organophosphorous compounds, inactivate an enzyme in the body called acetylcholinesterase, which is essential for the normal functioning of the nervous system. Nerve impulses are transmitted between the nerve fibres and various organs and muscles by the compound. Normally, when acetylcholine has done its job it is destroyed so that the nerve fibres can transmit further impulses. The nerve gases inhibit these molecules. Therefore, these gases still act on the nerves in one's body. They accumulate and block nerve function. Symptoms include a contraction of the pupils of the eyes; blurred vision; uncontrollable crying; nausea; vomiting; urinary incontinence; the accumulation of fluid in the lungs causing severe respiratory distress; and effects on consciousness ranging from reduced mental capabilities to convulsions, deep coma and, finally, death. Death comes from suffocation caused by a paralysis of the respiratory muscles. A minute drop of nerve gas, inhaled or absorbed through the skin or eyes, is enough to kill. Of all the chemical warfare agents, tabun is the most attractive for terrorists. These nerve gases are used because of their great lethality. Of the nerve gases, tabun, produced and used by Iraq in the Gulf War, is the easiest to make and, therefore, the most likely candidate for chemical terrorism. Tabun is prepared in two stages. It is not difficult to buy on the open market moderate quantities of the chemical used in its preparation. Anyone who can handle chemicals reasonably competently can make tabun. No very special chemical apparatus is needed. A competent chemist could be hired, if necessary, by a terrorist group. Only a fraction of a litre of this nerve agent would be needed to give such an organisation enormous killing power. Currently, it would be virtually impossible to prevent terrorists getting hold of the chemicals needed to produce such a quantity of nerve gas. Anyone could buy enough chemicals and no questions would be asked. This is what is around at the moment. Hopefully, this bill will prohibit and control this sort of thing happening. I say `hopefully' because many of these chemicals are now available. They could have been stockpiled and stored away and some sort of terrorist group could make these other chemicals and nerve gases in the future. As I said at the beginning, this is an important bill. It is a bill that Australia has played a major role in initiating. I trust that we can get all the other countries of the world to sign, and be a part of, this convention. It would be a very proud day if Australia and the original signatories got everyone else to sign and we could honestly say that nerve gases would be outlawed as weapons of mass destruction. However, I fear that this is probably not the case. I feel that a particular nation which had access to these chemicals or had these nerve gas weapons tucked away would, if in a corner in a really bad conflict, use them. I honestly feel that human beings have not developed to the stage where they would take a moral stance and not use them if they were backed into a corner. However, this bill is a step along the way. I am very pleased that I have been able to play a little part in it by bringing to this House some of the horrible consequences for people if these chemical weapons are used. I commend the bill to the House.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/para[6]","N/A","N/A"

It is good to see that he showed another dimension of his work, if that is what it can be called, through his contribution today.  I have spoken previously on the subject of chemical weapons usage. While we are standing around here today congratulating ourselves on the fact that Australia is implementing its obligations under the chemical weapons treaty or convention, it is poignant to pause and consider the bloodshed and butchery still going in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On Saturday, we saw one of the most horrendous atrocities committed against unarmed, innocent citizens when shells were fired from the outskirts of Sarejevo into the marketplace, causing a terrible lot of carnage, injuries and so on. I have been to the region, including Sarejevo, twice. Here we are talking about the chemical weapons convention and Australia's contribution towards the implementation of the chemicals weapon convention domestically when an apparently unstoppable bloody war is going on in the middle of Europe in the 1990s at a time when we consider ourselves to be very civilised indeed. If air strikes are not conducted as soon as possible against those gun emplacements, where cowardly gunners are firing at innocent civilians, any moral force that we can muster in talking about items such as a chemical weapons convention will be dissipated entirely. I am absolutely dismayed by the weakness, lack of resolve and apparent total lack of will on the part of the Europeans, in conjunction with the United Nations and the United States, to deal with what has been one of the most outrageous acts of barbarity that we have seen conducted in the postwar period within the European theatre. If that is civilisation in the 1990s, God help us. I have already twice mentioned this subject. When we were debating the Gulf War in this chamber—at that stage the honourable member for Dunkley was not with us—we were obviously concerned about the prospect of the Iraqi dictator using his Scud missiles to launch chemical weapons through the region, particularly at Israel or the forces that had been mustered as part of the coalition put together by then President Bush through the United Nations. In that debate, I mentioned some of the types of chemicals that the Iraqi dictator had in his stockpile. Some of those weapons were mentioned by the honourable member for Dunkley in his description of chemical weapon effects. Some of them have quite severe, debilitating and horrendous effects on the human physiology. I mentioned, both in that speech on the Middle East and in a private member's debate in relation to the chemical weapons convention, my favourite poet from the First World War, Wilfred Owen, who is probably one of the great poets of that particular period. He described eloquently the terror and the horror of the use of chemical weapons in warfare. I will just quote a section of his poem Dulce et Decorem est :","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, as the honourable member has described, that was not the first instance of chemical warfare. He mentioned the Greeks. Between the years 431BC and 404BC, during sieges of two Athenian cities, the Spartans threw burning mixtures of sulfur and pitch over the walls. That produced fires that asphyxiated the residents. This was obviously something of considerable terror.  In the Middle Ages, Genghis Khan shot huge balls of burning pitch and sulfur into cities as part of his standard plan of attack or siege. In 1812, Thomas Cochrane, a British naval officer, proposed the burning of ships filled with sulfur to drive Napoleon's forces from fortifications around French ports. During the Crimean War, a British chemist suggested two new munitions. One was a hollow shell, filled with a solution of phosphorous, which would break open on impact, exposing the phosphorous to the air, causing fires and blinding smoke. The other one was a brittle shell, filled with a compound that would burn, that could be used against Russian ships during the battles that raged in the Crimean War. Fortunately for the conscience of the British military leadership, the war department in the United Kingdom turned down those ideas. During the American Civil War, both sides either proposed or used chemicals as weapons. In 1905, in the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese were said to have pushed burning rags soaked with arsenic compound into Russian trenches. I think the honourable member for Dunkley mentioned that too. There are three points prior to World War I that are important to mention in relation to chemical weapons. The first one is that chemical and biological weapons played a sometimes decisive role even before the birth of Christ. Secondly, the use of chemicals—with the exception of sulfur, which had been mined for about 1,000 years—was limited technologically. But it was seen as immoral long before the large-scale use in World War I. I mentioned the example of the proposals during the Crimean War. On 22 April 1915 near Ypres in Belgium, a German general's staff in a test released chlorine gas along a six-kilometre front. It had devastating results: 15,000 casualties were reported in the press and a hole eight kilometres long was created in the allied lines. Within six months the allies had produced their own gases. Both sides adopted simple gas masks. In July 1917 the Germans introduced mustard gas, delivered in liquid form by artillery shells. It took several hours to develop the cloud that was, of course, the potential danger to the troops but the areas were contaminated and could not be occupied safely for at least a day after attack. In fact, potent concentrations of mustard gas have since been discovered in the area of Verdun up to the late 1970s—such was the potency of the gases used at that time. The casualties are extremely high in gas attacks. In fact, 34 per cent of all American expeditionary force casualties in October 1918 were caused by gas, primarily mustard gas. In the first 10 days following the introduction of mustard gas, the Germans fired one million shells over the allies and created an advantage over them—a monopoly, in fact—in the use of gas for over a year. During the intervening period we saw some significant improvements in the low technology that had been used previously. In 1934 the I.G. Farben company developed an organophosphorus compound called tabun—I think that was mentioned by the honourable member for Dunkley—which can disable or kill through contact with the skin or through a liquid vapour that attacks the lungs and the eyes—a terrible form of punishment and death. It was used by Italy in the 1935-36 war against the Abyssinians under the dictator Mussolini. From 1937 to 1945 the Japanese used it in China. There was also an incident within Australia where some experiments were conducted on Australian troops. An article entitled `The unfought chemical war' that was published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists of December 1991 states:","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/para[10]","N/A","N/A"

Ten minutes later, Mitchell was rushing around the island to tend sampling equipment.  But a few hours later, he and another Australian soldier were ordered back onto the island—this time, stripped of their respirators and protective clothing. They were forced to camp on the island from dusk to dawn in ordinary clothing without any safety equipment.

Recently, forty-seven years after he was burned, he was able to settle with the Australian government for $25,000. The article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is instructive in light of some of the recent revelations about nuclear experiments conducted in the 1940s and 1950s, in conditions of some secrecy, on American citizens. Those experiments were carried out either in ignorance or negligent of the actual cost in terms of injury to the participants in those experiments.  The use of chemical weapons by the Japanese against the Chinese dried up after the allies went into the offensive in the Pacific and the US threatened retaliation on China's behalf. In other words, it was quite clear that the usage of chemical weapons occurred only in situations where retaliation of the victims was virtually impossible. We know that the German dictator Hitler, whose regime used gas against civilians and those who were exterminated in the concentration camps—the death camps controlled by the Nazi Germans—had had a quite terrible experience of a mustard gas attack in the First World War. In fact, his horror of it somehow prevented him from using gas weapons during the Second World War, although, of course, it did not prevent him and his minions from using gas against those poor unfortunate millions of Jews and others who perished during the Holocaust in the 1930s and 1940s. Between 1967 and 1968 in Yemen the Egyptians used lethal chemical weapons in the war between the royalists and the republicans. Over 100 people were killed in one attack in 1967. Between 1961 and 1970 in the Vietnam war the United States and its allies used herbicides and riot control agents. Between 1875 and the mid-1980s in South-East Asia US government investigators concluded that nerve agents, irritants and other chemicals were used in Laos. The Soviet Union supported or employed lethal chemical weapons in South-East Asia and in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Of course, as has been mentioned before, between 1982 and the late 1980s, during the Iran-Iraq war we saw chemical weapons used by both sides. When we look at that evidence it is clear that there is some fear that the use of chemical weapons is on the rise. In the first 20 years after World War II there was no significant confirmed usage of lethal chemical weapons. But in the second 20 years there were four to five confirmed instances of military decisive use of chemical warfare, including the first instance—as I have already mentioned—of a two-sided use in a war of chemical weapons recorded since World War I. I suppose the fact that only a limited number of countries has ratified the convention is a matter of some concern; hence, my caution about our congratulating ourselves too much for playing our part. The coalition supports the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill. It gives effect to Australia's obligation as a party to the chemical weapons convention signed in Vienna and it is the legislative basis for the implementation of our obligations under that convention. In the 95 years since the first attempts at the Hague conference on chemical weapons and in the 69 years since their use—but not possession—was outlawed under the 1925 Geneva protocol, the international community has been trying to ban chemical weapons. In January 1993 the milestone agreement was signed. I would like to pass on my congratulations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and those officials who represented the Australian government and who were responsible for our participation for their contribution to that historic milestone agreement. The chemical weapons convention is the first treaty in history to ban the development, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of an entire category of weapons. The coalition is particularly pleased to see support in the Asia-Pacific region for the convention. We urge those other nations to continue this commitment to the principles of the convention by ratifying the convention at the earliest convenience. To date, 154 countries have signed the convention but, unfortunately, only four have ratified it. I am pleased to say that Australia is seeking to set an example for other nations. But the coalition and others have a tremendous concern about the limited international support for the convention, particularly from those countries that are interested in or possess chemical weapons. For example, North Korea did not sign; most Middle East states have not signed. That is worrying in itself, particularly when we take into account North Korea's recently displayed attitude towards the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Iraq has declared 140,000 chemical weapons, 600 tonnes of bulk chemicals and 3,500 tonnes of precursor stock to UN inspectors. That is what we know of. Is this the total stockpile that Iraq has? Who knows. There are now 20 states that are believed to possess chemical weapons, which is a matter of considerable concern. In the dying moments of my speech, I turn to the physical aspects of Australia's expenditure and participation via the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill. We will be contributing to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons, which is based in the Hague, about $1.7 million per annum. But, at the same time, in establishing our own Chemical Weapons Convention Office, we will be expending $250,000 per annum. The coalition is not entirely satisfied that that expenditure is justified and, with the existing resources and the skills of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, that might be something that the minister may consider in the future. The coalition urges that every effort be made bilaterally and multilaterally to overcome the convention's shortcomings. The signing and the ratification of the convention must obviously not be seen as the end point. It may not be a starting point, as has been mentioned earlier, but it is only a step along what is a very difficult road. The convention must continue to evolve so that there can be a greater reassurance that such weapons are effectively outlawed. Although the convention has some limitations, it is an important step towards banning weapons which have an immediate and appallingly detrimental effect on human life and which should never be countenanced as weapons of war. We on this side of the chamber will continue to maintain our long running support for the elimination of such weapons of mass destruction. As a member of the coalition, I am pleased to support the bill.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/para[21]","N/A","N/A"

The bill will establish a legislative basis for the implementation of our responsibilities under the convention. As has been said by earlier speakers, this is a landmark convention and we can be rightly proud of Australia's role in its development and its conclusion.  The government, through Senator Gareth Evans, bureaucrats and diplomats from within the departments and Australian industry have all played an important role in developing and concluding this convention. They did that by helping to focus the international community on concluding the negotiations. Australia also initiated the Government-Industry Conference Against Chemical Weapons, which was crucial in getting industry support for this initiative. We also worked hard to ensure support within our region, as was commented on by earlier speakers, which shows that the Asia-Pacific region is a strong supporter of this convention. At a crucial time of the negotiations, an Australian draft was used to assist in the conclusion. It is a landmark treaty. It is the first treaty ever to ban an entire class of weaponry and to provide anything like an adequate means of verification of such a ban. It is the second truly global disarmament treaty, following the 1972 biological weapons convention. It is also the longest and most complex global arms control or disarmament agreement ever negotiated and it is longer than all the others combined. The verification system of the CWC is the most ambitious in the history of arms control and disarmament. It is more detailed and complex than the International Atomic Energy Agency and its nuclear safeguard system. The CWC verification system will also be the most expensive multilateral verification system ever, at an estimated annual cost of between $US100 million and $US200 million. The number of sites subject to inspection will be far in excess of all previous arms control and disarmament agreements combined. There is a great need for such a convention. Chemical weapons are weapons of mass destruction. They are non-specific. They can cause massive civilian casualties and have done so. They have been used in a number of wars, as has been mentioned by earlier speakers, against Australian soldiers—for example, in World War I. More recently, they have been used in the Iran-Iraq war and again by the Iraqi government in internal actions against its Kurdish population. They are cheap, easy to produce and lethal. They can and have been used in all levels of conflict. Unfortunately, in this day and age, the technology is for sale and there are unscrupulous individuals and groups throughout the world who will export their technology regardless of the cost. In turning to the effects of chemical weapons, I refer briefly to the official history of the Australian Army Medical Services in the war of 1914-18. A report dated 17 July 1917 by Major C.G. Douglas RAMC of the British Gas Directorate outlined his investigation of the first casualties from what was then called yperite, now referred to as mustard gas. The report reads:","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The majority of the men appear to have gone to sleep after the gas bombardment was over. From two to five hours later they were awakened with pain in the eyes which rapidly became intolerable. The eyes and nose were running as if they had a violent cold in the head. Sneezing was very frequent, but there seems to have been no cough or discomfort in the chest as a rule. Tickling of the nose and burning and irritation of the throat were usually present. Nausea became marked and repeated vomiting occurred and persisted for some hours.

Many members of this House would know of people or relatives who, as a result of gas attacks at that time, died earlier than they should have, in quite horrendous and horrible circumstances. That is why this initiative is so important and deserves the support of the entire world community.  The scope of the chemical weapons convention is very wide. The convention commits each country not to develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain, transfer or use chemical weapons or engage in any military preparations to use chemical weapons. To date, 154 nations have signed the convention and we will be the fifth nation to ratify it. Many more nations are in the process of ratification but it is important that Australia show the way. There are a number of key aspects of the convention and I will talk about several of them today. All existing chemical weapons holdings and production capabilities are to be destroyed within 10 years of the treaty coming into force. An extension of up to five years is available in particular circumstances. This is an ambitious timetable. The amount of chemical weapons that the Iraqi government has in its store has been mentioned earlier in this debate. There is also something in the region of 30,000 metric tonnes of chemical weapons in the United States and 40,000 metric tonnes in Russia that need to be disposed of. We come to the key question of how that might be done. I guess the choices can be paraphrased as environmentally safe versus cost efficient. It has been estimated that the cost of disposing of the Russian stockpile is in the region of $10 billion and the cost of disposing of the American stockpile is in the region of $8 billion. At this time, the preferred method of disposal is high temperature incineration. As the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) mentioned earlier, there are concerns about the actual impact of that form of disposal on the environment. When we talk about the disposal of weapons of this nature, we have to be very careful to ensure that the cure is not worse than the initial symptoms. High temperature incineration could create a problem that is second only to the actual use of the weapons themselves. A lot more work has to be done to determine what technology is appropriate to dispose of these weapons. Greenpeace has mentioned a number of different technologies that could be used: chemical processes, biological methods, photochemical processes, electrochemical techniques and neutralisation. I do not pretend to be an expert on any of these technologies. What I would say is that it is crucial for the future of the world that each of these technologies be investigated and the most appropriate technology utilised. The appropriateness has to relate to the effect of the technology on the environment, not just to its cost. We will live for a long time with the results of an incorrect decision being taken on such matters. Verification is obviously a key component of this convention. It will be crucial to the success of the convention and its aims. The convention covers both military and commercial sites. The reason for this is obvious. Chemical weapons can be produced in a range of circumstances and in a range of facilities. The number of potential facilities that are available for the production of such weapons makes verification particularly difficult. I do not think any of us believe that the treaty in itself can detect and destroy every chemical weapon or ensure that such weapons are never again produced or used. But, in terms of the wider question of the impact that the treaty will have on the world we live in, there is some hope and some scope for it to detect and deter military significant developments in chemical weaponry. I think that outcome is achievable for a number of reasons. The number of known chemical weapons possessors is small. At this stage, the US, Russia and Iraq are the only declared holders of chemical weapons. That minimises some of the developments needed in this area. The list of potential possessors, those not declared but suspected, is also relatively small in terms of the world community. That also will assist in the verification and notification of hot spots. Most nations totally abhor chemical weapons and at no time would consider using them. The overwhelming international support for the objectives of the convention will assist in its operation. The two major holders of chemical weapons, the US and Russia, presently have in place bilateral agreements that will be of assistance in the disposal and verification of some of the larger stockpiles of chemical weapons. Although there are always problems with verification, satellite surveillance and human and electronic capabilities are of some interest. Chemical weapons can be hidden but they can leave traces of their production and their movements that can be detected through a range of means. Industry involvement is also an important initiative in this scheme. The national chemical industry in Australia and the international chemical industry have shown solid support for this convention. They understand the importance of their industry but they also understand the horrifying potential for their industry to be misused. They have no wish to see that occur and they are working to assist. Their assistance will be crucial in the monitoring of chemicals and their movement to nation states that are likely to utilise chemical weapons or to endeavour to produce them. The honourable member for Dunkley mentioned that the chemicals we are talking about here are of a limited nature. If we are looking at military utilisation then we are talking about large amounts of these chemicals. As these chemicals are produced, utilised and moved around the world it will be possible to verify their existence, and verification can point to where there is the potential for the development of chemical weapons. The inspection system which is being developed under this convention comes in two stages: routine monitoring inspections and challenge inspections. Challenge inspections are a crucial development in this treaty. They will be mandatory and they will be at short notice. A range of conditions are attached to the inspections but this is the first global arms control treaty to contain this sort of provision. When we look at the International Atomic Energy Agency and the problems that have been experienced recently with North Korea, for example, in relation to inspections and the verification of the existence of nuclear facilities and the capacity to develop nuclear weapons, we see how difficult it is to carry out verification and have a proper inspection regime. Only time will tell whether this system will work in a totally effective manner. It is certainly a quantum leap from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Export controls are also part of the system to be implemented under the convention. By `export controls' I mean that the movement and provision of certain types of chemicals that are crucial to the development of chemical weapons will over time be controlled. That will lead to restraint of the spread of those chemicals. It will also be an incentive to those parties who have not acceded to the treaty to actually become part of the treaty because over time, if they are not party to the treaty, they will have trouble getting hold of these chemicals, many of which have alternative uses which are safe and peaceful. Over time, I think that will assist in developing a system that enables us to know what is going on with these chemicals and what their movements are. Another key issue is what we can do to ensure that, if chemical weapons are utilised, people are in a position to try to defend themselves. The treaty protects the right of any party state to research, develop and produce means of defence against chemical weapons and encourages the fullest possible international cooperation in this field. Because of the difficulties already mentioned regarding the capacity to totally eliminate chemical weapons, the need to continue to develop defensive capabilities for those countries that may be subject to an attack of this nature is clear. The need to share defensive technologies amongst those nations that will be party to this convention is also of critical importance. Any initiatives that will assist countries to defend themselves against chemical warfare will assist in making chemical weapons less effective and therefore less desirable as a military option. This convention, as has been mentioned earlier, is not perfect—it has a range of problems—but it is a major step forward in the field of international disarmament and arms control. Australia can be proud of the role it has played in the development and conclusion of this treaty. However, much work remains to be done. Many nations who have signed are still to ratify. Some countries have not signed, including a number which are suspected internationally of holding or working to develop chemical weapons. The verification system remains to be tested. Although extensive in comparison to earlier treaties, the treaty faces difficulties regarding the cost of the verification system and the large number of potential sites involved. Disposal of existing stockpiles also presents a major challenge to the international community. Environmental concerns must be addressed and all potential disposal technologies must be investigated. However, this treaty has a lot going for it in comparison to its predecessors. The challenge is for the international community not to rest on its laurels. For this convention to succeed it will require a renewed commitment internationally to encourage ratification, pressure on non-signatories to take part. We must ensure that the verification system works and continue to build on the overwhelming view internationally that weapons such as these are abhorrent. Australia must continue its constructive role in ensuring that the above objectives are met. Our role in the development and conclusion of this convention should be a source of great pride to all of us, but we must continue to lead the way in the operation of the chemical weapons convention in the years ahead. I am confident that we can do that. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The Homebush closure, in particular, will cause dislocation and some hardship, especially for the employees, with about 400 jobs being lost. I would have hoped that the shadow minister, as well as other members of the opposition, would join the government in saying that we are pleased to see that Ford is committed to assisting those employees to find new positions and trying, where possible, to encourage people to undertake retraining programs.  Today's announcement, of course, is of some concern, but it has to be put into perspective. The car industry today is undergoing change, but the car industry has also had some success. It is focusing on the segments of the car industry where it has the greatest chances of success, especially with the medium and large cars. It is also able to do that in a market which allows it to trade internationally. In 1985 our motor vehicle industry's exports were only about $380 million—that is, $380 million of exports when the honourable member opposite was advising the Fraser government. Today, exports from the motor vehicle industry total $1.5 billion. That is a massive turnaround.","Manufacturing Industry","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

GMH will spend $575 million in upgrades, and Ford is going to spend $400 million, including $250 million for a substantial facelift on the Falcon.  With that record, I would have thought that people opposite would have not only highlighted the difficulties that arise in the car industry, such as those at Homebush, but also given the government and the industry credit when it has been able to encourage investment in the long-term future of this industry—an industry which those opposite would have wiped out with their zero tariff policies if they had been on this side of the House. If the Leader of the Opposition had been sitting in this chair here, the Australian car industry would have been shutting up its entire operation in Australia because those opposite wanted zero tariffs. We all know that they have suddenly seen the light and do not favour zero tariffs any more, even though the honourable member for Barker has criticised your tariff policies in the party room. We believe the Leader of the Opposition when he says he has changed his mind. The shadow minister for industry said that he believed that more should be done to enhance micro-economic reform and that there was not enough action on the government's part in reducing business input costs. Honourable members might notice that there is a gap on the front bench between the honourable member for Berowra and the shadow minister. That seat belongs to the honourable member for Gippsland. Why do I mention that? The honourable member for Gippsland is the shadow minister for resources. When this government has been forcing the Liberal governments in New South Wales and Victoria to reform their electricity industries, to reduce business input costs, what have the federal Liberals been saying as the state Liberals have dragged their feet? The federal Liberals have been saying nothing. The shadow minister for resources put out endless press releases on Mabo all through last year. Did he ask one question in this House about micro-economic reform of the electricity industry? No. Did he ask one question of his state Liberal colleagues to hurry up the reform? No. Why does someone on the other side not show some real commitment to micro-economic reform and pick up the phone, ring John Fahey and tell him to get on with micro-economic reform of the New South Wales electricity industry?","Manufacturing Industry","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","38","0","Mr WILLIS","ZJ4","GELLIBRAND","ALP","N/A","615","—I thank the honourable member for his question because it raises a very important issue for economic recovery, and that is business investment, which to this stage has not been a substantial factor at all in recovery. Although we have been out of recession for some time now with growth for the last nine quarters, we have not had any assistance in that period from business investment. But that is to be expected, because business investment will not take place early in the recovery, because capacity utilisation is low and there is basically no incentive for businesses to invest more in increasing capacity when they are not using their existing capacity at anything like full bore.  As the recovery goes on, clearly the circumstances in which capacity utilisation is a pressure on the operations of the company and an inducement to increased investment come more into play. We are now starting to reach that stage. It is also important in trying to develop that business investment that conditions exist in the economy which are conducive to increased investment, apart from simply pressure on existing capacity, if we are not going to get spill over into increased imports. The important factor for us to realise at the moment is that conditions do exist in Australia for business investment which are very conducive to investment taking place. The government has been concerned over the last couple of years to provide various incentives for business to undertake investment. Since the One Nation package of early 1992, we have brought down a number of measures to assist investment: accelerated depreciation, which this year will cost in the order of $215 million; the reduction of company tax to 33 per cent, which this year will cost about $440 million; the 10 per cent general investment allowance, which this year will cost about $130 million; and the development allowance, which is a special investment allowance for large projects over $50 million. That is something which will come into play more gradually, but something like 165 applications for registration have been granted at this stage, with a total capital value of $37 billion. There were, in fact, 500 applications for registration with a total capital value of over $100 billion. Of those 500, so far 165 have progressed to being registered and their total capital value is $37 billion. One hundred of those have been approved in the last half year. I think it is also important to mention in this context, particularly in light of today's news and the first question, that the development allowance has now been extended to the motor industry. That resulted from change to the legislation last year which received royal assent a few weeks ago. Those who have major projects in the motor vehicle industry and the print media, which was also part of that amendment, have until next Tuesday to get their applications for registration to the Development Allowance Authority. There are also fundamental improvements to the economy which are conducive to investment. We see corporate profitability at a high level. In fact, it is getting close to the peak level of 1989 even though, of course, we are at a much lower stage of the cycle than we were then. Interest rates are at historical lows; they are the lowest in 20 years. Inflation is around its lowest level for 30 years and, importantly, inflationary expectations are very low. The recent National Australia Bank survey of business inflation expectations showed that 80 per cent of businesses expected inflation to be less than four per cent for the rest of the century. So, clearly, business expectations of inflation are very good. We have also had dramatic improvements in our international competitiveness over the last few years. As I mentioned, the fact that spare capacity is starting to be eroded is also a real factor in inducing investment. All of this means that we can be confident of business investment becoming a much stronger factor from here on. The recent September quarter survey by the Bureau of Statistics on capital expenditure points to a pick-up in plant and equipment expenditure in the remainder of this year. The National Australia Bank has revised up its business investment expectations for this year and three quarters of respondents to the recent BCA survey expect to increase investment in the six months to March 1994, with one-third expecting it to increase by 10 per cent. As a result of all of that, we have been able to upgrade our investment forecasts for this year. We originally budgeted for investment to increase by only a quarter of a per cent. As a result of the changes to the forecasts, which I announced last week, that figure became 4 1/4 per cent. That is for the whole year on the whole year. More indicative of what is happening is the through the year figure. The through the year figure in the budget was 10 3/4per cent. We now expect that to be more like 16 3/4 per cent. We can be confident that business investment will pick up. It is already picking up and the conditions are there for much larger impact in business investment in the next financial year.","Business Investment","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is the sort of scrutiny I am supposed to be running away from.  Last year, 81 questions were asked of me: 42 by the government and 39 by the opposition. In other words, this is the scrutiny which the opposition says I am subjected to and afraid of. With the opportunity now presented to the opposition by my appearance at question time on Mondays and Thursdays, the Leader of the Opposition will have an opportunity to lift his batting average from one a week to at least two a week, if he wants to avail himself of that opportunity. The Leader of the Opposition did not ask me the questions because he did not like the answers. And he will not like the answers any more this year than he did last year. Back in his office, in that caraway seed, that split pea he calls a heart, he would be saying, `Thank God I haven't got to go in there every day. I haven't got to at least be scored every day. I don't have to rise to the occasion every day'. He would be that glad of the fact that these arrangements exist. There is, I think, a compelling case, which the government has recognised, simply to change some of the focus of question time away from the principal three or four ministers to a broader cross-section of the ministry, to focus on the getting of information to give back bench members of parliament—that is, the backbench of either the opposition or the government—a greater role in the process, which they enjoyed more when I first came here in 1969 than is the case today. As a consequence, I think that is more likely to happen; that is, people will have these opportunities.

I think that introduces more opportunities to question the executive. I know it is passe for honourable members opposite to talk about questions on notice, but questions on notice have at various times been used over the period for inquiring members and not simply grandstanders.  Let me just say a couple of things about the constitution and the Senate, seeing they were mentioned. I do not believe that the monarch of Great Britain should be the head of the government of Australia, the constitutional head of this nation. That is my view and it is the view of many Australians. Australia, its institutions and the nation cannot adequately be represented in those terms. That is no commentary at all on the commitment which Queen Elizabeth II has made enthusiastically and conscientiously over the years in performing that task. That is a debate worth having—so says even His Royal Highness, Prince Charles. The Leader of the Opposition is now running a case against the debate on the constitution where he has been disagreed with by the heir to the throne himself. I do not know where that leaves all those lickspittles. The Senate has a very clear role in the federal constitutional arrangements of Australia but it is not the representative chamber where the government is formed. That is the point I have made. This is the representative chamber. It is unrepresentative to have an equal number of senators in small or large states. The Senate was designed to operate as a states house. Perverting its use as a parties' house to try to change the principal financial legislation of governments is, of course, abusing the Senate's powers, and I will say that till the cows come home. If those opposite do not like it, bad luck. On the central point, if the opposition wants to rise to the occasion and address questions to me or to members of the frontbench of the government they will have greater opportunities to do that on a broader scale than they have had in the past. These changes are real reforms which should have been contemplated many years ago.","House of Representatives: Procedure","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[3]/answer/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

It would be a matter of great concern to people to learn that the opposition is intending to interfere with their prospects of substantial superannuation payments on retirement. If the opposition were to come into office, there would be a freezing of the super guarantee at its then levels, as the Leader of the Opposition indicated on Sunday to be his policy, which the Prime Minister referred to yesterday.  The honourable member for Corio asked what the effect would be on a worker. Let us look at a worker earning $600 a week who started to be covered by the super guarantee in 1992 at age 25, and who expects to work until age 65. Leaving aside the employee contribution and taking it to the nine per cent, and making some conservative assumptions about a CPI growth of two per cent, wages growth of 3 1/2 per cent and super fund investment earnings of six per cent, that worker could look forward to a superannuation benefit at retirement of $464,000. If the opposition were to get into office at the next election and if the Leader of the Opposition were the leader and he implemented his policy of freezing the super guarantee, that amount of money would be reduced by $120,000. If that worker were employed by a small business, the reduction would in fact be $170,000. This is a major policy item that the opposition is expounding through its leader. By freezing the super guarantee charge, it is going to take direct action to ensure that workers of this country would receive far less in the way of retirement benefits through the super guarantee charge than would happen under this government's policy. That is bad enough, but in yesterday's question when the Prime Minister was emphasising this point, the Leader of the Opposition kept interjecting, `What about the FitzGerald report?', as though Dr FitzGerald in his report on national savings had said that there was something wrong with the super guarantee charge. It is true that Dr FitzGerald had some criticisms of it, but he did not say that it should be frozen. He said that it was not big enough. He said that it should be 18 per cent not 12 per cent. The criticism that he made was not anything like what the Leader of the Opposition was talking about. He in no way endorses the policy of the Leader of the Opposition of freezing the super guarantee charge.

I refer to comments made by Professor Adrienne Clarke at the CSIRO-UNIDO conference on clean production in Melbourne recently that Australia and the countries of the Asia-Pacific region had just 30 years to head off environmental catastrophe and that the challenge was to leapfrog the dirty phase of industrialisation in the rapidly growing developing countries of the region. In what way does the government's aid program contribute to the mitigation of this impending environmental catastrophe in our region?","Environment: Aid","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I saw Professor Adrienne Clarke's remarks and I could not agree more with them. Indeed, promoting ecologically sustainable development in our own region is essential not just for our future prosperity, but for the prosperity of the whole region.  The government has moved decisively, firmly and strongly to ensure that these problems are tackled through our development cooperation program. For example, this year more than $100 million of our development cooperation program, our aid program, will be spent on environmental activities. It is important that I say, during the visit of Paias Wingti, the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, that we are spending $5.7 million there on a project to protect some of the world's finest rainforest areas and marine resources. In Indonesia, we are spending some $5 million developing environmentally sensitive and sustainable land use practices. In China, we are spending $14 1/2 million to install ozone friendly refrigeration technology.","Environment: Aid","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

She has been relentless in initiating and promoting our accession to climate change, ozone depletion and the world's biological diversity—put these down to her. I am very proud of her activities in that regard.  Make no mistake that we live on one planet in this context, because, if left unchecked, problems of the regional environment will very quickly translate to problems for us in Australia. Something which is often forgotten, but let us not forget it, is that in Australia we have extremely good expertise in the area of environmental management—sanitation, waste management and clean water supplies. By showcasing Australia's expertise and technology, development cooperation provides opportunities for Australian firms to get involved in South-East Asia and to meet an enormous growing infrastructural demand. Indeed, the World Bank has estimated that by 1995, next year, the total demand for environmental activities in south and South-East Asia will be around $US35 billion and currently much of that is unmet. How does the opposition propose to handle this problem? I notice that although there have been various repudiations of Fightback there has still been no repudiation of the commitment in Fightback to cut our overseas aid program by $100 million—to carve $100 million out of a program which advances our interest in such important ways. I have yet to hear from the honourable member for Kooyong or the Leader of the Opposition any repudiation of this policy. I am waiting to hear it because it seems to me that we need to think about increasing our aid program rather than decreasing it. I challenge the opposition to abandon this dopey and stupid commitment to cut our aid program, and I am waiting to hear its response.","Environment: Aid","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","95","0","Mr HOWE","EH4","BATMAN","ALP","N/A","622","—I thank the honourable member for his question. As honourable members know, over the last two years the housing industry has performed, in terms of the number of starts, as well as at any time in the postwar period. Furthermore, affordability levels are as good as they have been for nine years and we operate in an inflationary environment which is better than it has been for 30 years.  The housing industry continues to perform well, although the expectation is that there will be some downturn next year. That is all the more reason why we should be looking at the structure of the housing industry for the future. It is a matter of great concern. As was pointed out by the managing director of A.V. Jennings last week, some 45,000 small firms are currently operating in the housing industry in Australia. The managing director makes the point that that degree of fragmentation makes the prospects for the housing industry in international competition very difficult. That is why it is important to emphasise the importance of the development of offsite manufacture in relation to housing. Indeed, a quiet revolution is under way in housing design and construction. There is a shift towards greater use of offsite manufacturing for many components of the Australian housing industry. This shift makes housing more affordable. It is a positive response by the residential development industry to the government's agenda of increasing housing choice. The residential development industry—including planners, architects, land developers, builders, building material manufacturers and suppliers—is changing the way in which it constructs and provides its products. This is a very important shift. It is interesting that the comment made by A.V. Jennings reflects the fact that it, the largest volume builder in Australia, is now constructing something like 50 per cent of the new houses in Queensland and northern New South Wales with this manufactured approach in which the great majority of the housing components and the construction of the housing is done offsite. That results in considerable efficiencies but, more importantly, it lays the basis for the development of a strong housing export industry. It is not simply a matter of offering more choice within the Australian housing industry. The housing industry needs to position itself so that it will be able to export its product and to play a role in relation to Australia's place within the region. Frankly, that will not happen while the industry continues to be so highly fragmented. It will not happen unless approaches are adopted that not only produce greater efficiency and reduce regulations but also make the construction of housing more efficient and more competitive. One can see from the way houses are constructed effectively in a day and fully completed within a week that these kinds of approaches are extremely important for efficiency and choice in Australia and, in the long term, for building an export base. The remarks I have made are very important. They are salutary. I believe the industry ought to be looking at what is occurring and seeking to restructure so that it can make a much greater contribution to Australia's export performance.","Housing","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is no secret that 40 per cent of all federal government award employees are now involved in enterprise bargaining. It is no secret that the enterprise bargaining process is producing, and continues to produce, enormous results. In the area where it has not been extended—the private sector—this government acted decisively last year to provide the opportunity for enterprise agreements to be spread throughout the whole of the federal award structure. As at the end of March, legislation will be in place which will allow for enterprise bargaining to be spread across the length and breadth of the Australian work force.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","153","0","Mr HOWARD","ZD4","(Bennelong-","LP","Manager of Opposition Business)","626","—I think many members of this House and many observers of the proceedings of parliament might have thought until today that they had heard the last word or seen the last act by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when it came to his contempt for the great institution of the Australian parliament. But we were mistaken because, in question time today, we saw in microcosm precisely what is wrong with the Prime Minister's attitude towards this parliament and why the Australian public holds the proceedings of parliament—particularly of question time—in such low repute, as they undoubtedly do.  The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) asked the Prime Minister a very precise question. He did not allege in his question that the Prime Minister had necessarily done anything wrong; he did not ask him a question that was outside the bounds of the standing orders; he asked the Prime Minister a very simple question: if an independent inquiry says his piggery is environmentally unsound, will he relocate his piggery? That is what he asked the Prime Minister. What did we get? We got no answer and we got 10 minutes of irrelevant abuse from the Prime Minister of this country about the opposition collectively. It was personal abuse and it was against my colleague and friend the honourable member for Barker, in particular. As much as the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) and his mate up there on the back bench the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) will interject, that in microcosm is what is wrong with parliament. Unless that is fixed—that means fixing the Prime Minister, getting rid of the Prime Minister—we will never lift the esteem of this parliament in the eyes of the Australian community. If there is one barrier between a parliament of high repute and a parliament of low repute, it is the current Prime Minister of Australia. He must be the most imperial republican Australia has ever seen, because if ever there were a person who had a pretence towards a system of absolutism it would be the current Prime Minister of Australia. I have finally come to the conclusion that the reason he wants to get rid of the Queen is that she is a constitutional monarch. I am quite certain that if she were an absolute monarch he would not only want to get rid of her but also want to replace her. Basically, this man has no reverence and no respect for the basic institutions of this country. If we go through his long career in public life, we will find contempt piled upon contempt for the great institutions of Australia. The Prime Minister regards question time as a courtesy extended by the executive to the parliament. How more arrogant could he possibly be? In other words, he is somebody who, in imperial fashion, deigns occasionally to bless us with his presence. Now he is translating that into action with these changes to question time. He regards the Senate as being unrepresentative swill. Government members —Hear, hear!  —Of course, he has a lot of mates on the other side. Long may they say, `Hear, hear!'. Long may they maintain their rage about the power of the Senate, because every time they do that those words are writ very large in the hearts and minds of Australians, particularly those who live in the states of Western Australia and Queensland—the people whose forebears entered into the federal compact on the basis that we would have a federal Senate with equality of representation from the states to counterbalance the preponderance of population in the larger states on the eastern seaboard. Those opposite should go on saying that because every time they do they lose support in places in Australia such as Western Australia and Queensland.  Not only does this man have contempt for this chamber but also he regards the Senate as being unrepresentative swill. He has no regard at all for the constitution of Australia, which has served this country well for almost 100 years. If honourable members thought that his contempt was reserved for institutions that might occasionally be associated in the eyes of some in the community with our side of politics, let me remind honourable members that two to three years ago the Prime Minister led an attack on one of those institutions which has been at the heart of the Australian labour movement for almost 100 years, and that is the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Honourable members opposite will know that I am no lover of the role of the Industrial Relations Commission in the Australian industrial relations Parthenon, but at least I am up-front about my objections. I notice that the honourable member for Banks is nodding. Undoubtedly he, along with his mate the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), will agree with everything I am about to say. In April 1991, when the Industrial Relations Commission handed down a decision that was unacceptable politically to the government, instead of accepting the umpire's decision, the Prime Minister said that the Industrial Relations Commission was corrupting the system. Instead of accepting that institution, which has been there for almost 100 years and which is sanctified by an act of parliament, the Prime Minister said, `Because it has given a decision that I don't like, I'm going to denigrate it, I'm going to push it aside and I'm going to traduce the integrity of the members of the commission'. The Prime Minister, along with his mate Bill Kelty, set about on a campaign of denigration and abuse against not only the late president of the commission, Barry Maddern, but also the other members of the bench. That was very much part of the Prime Minister's attitude. If anything gets in his way, no matter what place it has in the institutional fabric of Australia, no matter what part it has played in the history of Australia, he pushes it aside. He is the first Prime Minister that this country has had who has rubbished overseas his nation's flag. He is the first Prime Minister of this country who has so shamed the national reputation of this country overseas that he has rubbished its most treasured emblem abroad. No act that he will do between now and when he is expelled from the prime ministership of this country can possibly aspire to that height of impudence and insolence towards the institutions of our society. He may want to change our flag, he may have his imperial delusions of grandeur, but at the end of the day we are all accountable before the bar of public opinion. These changes are all about the convenience of the Prime Minister. They have nothing to do with reforming parliament. The reason these changes are being made is that the Prime Minister's minders have told him that it suits his convenience. The fact that he is reducing the accountability of the executive to parliament, that under these changes the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) would have been able to avoid the scrutiny to which she has been subjected over the last three weeks, is of no account to the Prime Minister. His sole objective has been to reduce the power and the role of parliament and to increase his own power, prestige and authority in this country. This is all about the grandeur of the Prime Minister. It has nothing to do with parliamentary reform. It is all about entrenching the power of the Prime Minister at the expense of the parliament and the great institutions of this country. It is all about concentrating more authority, in an arrogant fashion, into what has become known in the trade around here as the `Oval office'. It is all about the delusions that this Prime Minister has about his future role in the history of this country. For 93 years it has been the parliamentary tradition in Australia to have a robust question time. The Prime Minister defended question time when it suited him. He said that this was the clearing house of the nation's ideas. Now when it suits him to say and do otherwise, he dismisses question time as being of little account. In other words, parliamentary respect and tradition is turned on and off like a tap according to the Prime Minister's own political convenience. It suited the Prime Minister to use question time as a forum to abuse the opposition and to lie and cheat about the effect of its policies in the lead-up to the last election. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins) —Order! The honourable member for Bennelong! —I withdraw `lie'. It suited the Prime Minister to use question time to distort and deceive the Australian people about the impact of the opposition's policies in the lead-up to the last election. That was adjudged to be the politically smart and astute thing to do. The Prime Minister is now being advised that the politically astute and smart thing to do is to have some kind of `On-the-one-hand Paul' and `On-the-other-hand Paul'. There is the nice Paul who has lunches with nice people all around Australia.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

And there is the other Paul who is the bare-knuckled parliamentary bruiser. The common thread that runs through the Prime Minister's attitude is not a concern for this institution—he does not give a damn about this parliament—but a concern only about his political hide and his political future. He has been prepared to overturn this tradition. He and his colleague the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) rely rather speciously on some British precedents. It is amazing how this mob over there runs to British practice and tradition when it suits them.  The Prime Minister says, `In Britain the Prime Minister does not turn up every day'. Everybody knows that the House of Commons sits for 140 to 150 days a year. In contrast, the House of Representatives sits for 60 to 70 days a year. If we halve—as the Prime Minister intends to do in two weeks time—the number of days the Prime Minister has to come in here and answer questions, the Australian Prime Minister will answer questions on half the number of days that the British Prime Minister answers questions. So much for the British comparison. What about other comparisons? When the soon to be retired honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) came to see me in a very friendly fashion last year to talk about parliamentary reform he said, `We want to try to cooperate with you and we realise that if we are to make it work there's got to be a bit of give and take'. And he asked, `What do you want, John?'. I said, `For starters, we want supplementaries and a guaranteed minimum number of questions'. He said, `That's reasonable'. Then he said, `We want rosters'. I said, `We don't like rosters', and he said, `Well, if we introduced rosters it would be on one very important proviso: if you wanted a minister to attend because of a particular issue that had arisen, you would be able to require that minister's attendance'. What happened to that? I will tell the House what happened to that. The same thing happened to that as happened to the recommendations of the committee chaired by the Speaker on parliamentary broadcasts. Despite the intrinsic merit, it fell foul of the Keating jackboot. It did so because it did not suit his idea of how to run parliament to suit his own personal convenience. He would have said, `I don't want those opposition points of order rebroadcast on the television news bulletins. That means my abuse might be equalled by their reply. You can't have that. That's fair; that's balanced. You can't have fairness and balance in reporting of question time. Question time is a courtesy that the executive affords to the parliament. How can you possibly have balance in the reporting of question time?'. Exactly the same fate befell that. The piece de resistance is our mate over here, the Leader of the House, saying, `We're going to give you a guaranteed minimum number of questions'. He said, `John, that's something that you wanted'. He said to me in discussions, `John, I'm fighting hard for you. I'm trying to get you a guaranteed minimum number of questions'. What does he come up with? He comes up with a minimum number of 14. That is terrific. That is two less than the minimum average of the Fraser years and it is also less than the minimum average of the early years of the Hawke government. There is a little more to it than that. The honourable member for Swan and I were having a debate before lunch on the Howard Sattler program on 6PR in Perth and I said, `Kim, can you answer a question?'. He said, `Yeah, sure, John'. I said, `Kim, this number of 14 questions minimum. Are you going to write that into the sessional orders?'. He said, `That's a bit hard to do, John'. In other words, the government is not going to guarantee it. I will tell the House what is going to happen to the minimum of 14 questions. If the way question time is going does not suit the Prime Minister, whether we have had only three questions, if it suits his convenience he will pick up his papers and scuttle out of the House the way he did a few months ago when the opposition leader was having a go at him. These changes are all about the entrenchment of the power of the Prime Minister. They are about the most imperial republican this country has seen. They display that the Prime Minister cares not a jot about the great institution of this country and they portray most of all the supreme contempt and indifference he has towards the parliament of Australia.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","156","0","Mr BEAZLEY","PE4","(Swan-","ALP","Leader of the House)","629","—This lecture on constitutional convention has come from one of the 1975 Liberals, one of those who set about, systematically, to destroy the way in which parliament has operated as the supreme body in decision making in this country. To give him his due, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is one of the few 1975 Liberals who has publicly, since that time, regretted his actions.  I am glad that the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who wishes to be out of the coalition, has just congratulated the honourable member for Bennelong on his comments. No doubt the honourable member for Kennedy has joined the ranks—he probably leads the ranks in the National Party—of those who look for change in exchange for maintenance of the coalition. These are things that we note with interest as days pass by and as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) finds the ground shifting from under him. The fact of the matter is that the honourable member for Bennelong had much to be ashamed about in 1975. We on this side of the House do not accept lectures on the principles of the constitution. It will be some considerable period of time, I feel, before any of us will feel inclined to accept lectures on matters of principle from those opposite. However, we note with interest the utter obsession that has developed on the other side of the House with the personality and person of the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Prime Minister has already been before the electorate five times to have his conduct and attitude judged by the constituency to which the honourable member appeals. Five times he has appeared—the first four of those as a very prominent member and substantial contributor to the election campaigns of the government under Mr Hawke and on the latest occasion as Prime Minister. There have been repeated opportunities for the general public to make judgments about whether or not they feel they can live with his attitudes on things such as the monarchy or the Australian flag. None of these views were concealed from the Australian public during the last election campaign and the Australian public has the commonsense to know that it does not matter what the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong, I or anyone else thinks about the structure of the Australian constitution because before there is any change to the Australian constitution the public has to be consulted. That is all there is to it. It is as simple as that. The opposition, however, does not actually debate the principle of whether or not a constitutional monarchy is the sort of government that best suits us now, whether or not a non-Australian head of state representing, as a head of state frequently does, Australian interests overseas is the best way to go about things or whether or not we ought to codify the reserve powers—all of these sorts of issues flung up by the question of whether or not we should move to a republic. The explanation opposition members give to the Australian public as to why we should not change a constitution that has been in place for 100 years and which is supposed to last for thousands more is that they might impose an imperial presidency from Mr Keating. The interesting feature of that is that that is their obsession. I grew up in politics when Labor had a long period in opposition. We had an obsession, too. Our obsession was Bob Menzies. We found ourselves extraordinarily hard-pressed to stand up and sensibly develop and portray our policy because, I am afraid to say, in those days we were obsessed with the personality of Bob Menzies. So rather than debate the issues of the day we used to chant `Pig-iron Bob, pig-iron Bob'. We deserved to be where when we allowed ourselves to descend to such a moronic state of affairs. Those opposite have descended to that moronic state of affairs and that is why they are having the judgment passed on them which has been passed by the electorate on the last five occasions. The opposition makes great play of the fact that, from time to time, the Prime Minister uses colourful language. Colourful language used in this place tends to have attention drawn to it by the Speaker and from time to time the Prime Minister, as have opposition members, has been obliged to make withdrawals of statements he has made or expressions he has used. The thing I am interested about in all of this, again, is the psychology of those in the opposition and the utter obsession that they have developed with the personality of the Prime Minister and the fear in which they regard him. I cite one example. The Prime Minister did on one occasion use the term `scumbag' in this place—a term he must have seen when he viewed a Martin Scorsese film that used that epithet to describe a particular conflict between various elements of the criminal classes. He used that expression once in parliament in 1984. Yet, for the last nine years these absurd people opposite have been devoted to the portrayal in public that `this fellow goes around calling us scumbags'. It is an interesting reflection on the psychological condition of the opposition, not on the personality of the Prime Minister. Therefore, it has some level of historic interest from that point of view, but no interest whatsoever in terms of the governing of this nation. So here we have another source of difficulty as far as the opposition is concerned. The opposition in this regard, because of its obsession with the personality of the Prime Minister in a republican debate, has drawn appropriate rebukes from decent conservative commentators like Gerard Henderson. I recollect an article a while ago. I think it was written by Gerard Henderson. He referred to either the Leader of the Opposition or the honourable member for Bennelong and said, `So for you the debate has descended to this—you can't vote for a republic of Australia because the current Prime Minister might become president'. That demonstrates the pathetic decline in the mental capacities of those opposite in handling this problem. They are manifesting that sort of psychological condition, the deeply embattled experience. When I was Minister for Defence, from time to time I had described to me that soldiers often found themselves in an embattled condition. They become extremely narrowly focused as the threat to them develops. It is what makes them effective, at least in the context of a fighting war; that is, the very narrow conception of who is the enemy, to the exclusion of all other materials from the psychological environment around them. Unfortunately, they are not the sorts of circumstances which lead to commonsense in debate in normal political democratic arrangements. Those opposite manifest that psychological condition, as they are deeply wounded by the Prime Minister. Those opposite say, `Take a look at the polls'. The polls say that we are behind the Liberals. We have been behind the Liberals in every blinking poll before every election of the last five. So what? Those opposite have also raised the issue of question time. They come in here and say, `We are not going to be able to subject you to the scrutiny that we would be able to if you did not have rotational question time. But if you had given us supplementary questions and the opportunity to ask about 16 questions, then we would have been a bit more cheerful about it'. There has been one question per week from the Leader of the Opposition since this parliament sat. Eighteen per cent of all questions directed by the opposition since this parliament met have gone to the Prime Minister. If those opposite cannot fit their leader's question and the 18 per cent of their total questions into the increased number they will have available to them, that is too bad. What an extraordinary commentary on those opposite that their leader cannot get his one question up to the Prime Minister in the space of two blocks of 28 questions. If he cannot ask one question in the two blocks of 28 questions, it is too bad. It is a judgment on them, not a judgment on the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Bennelong said that we were not following the British tradition or we had cited the British tradition. By his mathematics, we were not conforming to the things that we said we were conforming to. It is true that the British parliament sits twice as long as this one. The British parliament also sits in a different whipping system from the one we have. The British parliament rarely has assembled the entirety of the body of members of parliament in the British House of Commons.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","158","0","Mr BEAZLEY","PE4","(Swan-","ALP","Leader of the House)","629","—We will drop the whipping in the British parliament. We will find another expression to deal with that problem. The British parliament sits longer because it deals with issues that state parliaments deal with here as well as the issues that federal parliaments deal with. That is the first point.  The second point is that, when ministers come for scrutiny to the British parliament, they do not come on rotation twice a week. British ministers come for scrutiny in the British parliament about once every three or four weeks. They do not come in blocks of 10, they come in blocks of one with junior ministers attached to them and turn up once every three weeks. Do those opposite think that is a better scrutiny than what is on offer here with a rotation of 10 days? Then we come to the question of the Prime Minister. The British Prime Minister comes in twice a week for 15 minutes. What is on offer here is the Australian Prime Minister twice a week for 45 minutes at least. That reverses some of the imbalance that is caused by the fact that the British parliament sits longer. The honourable member then raised the point of supplementary questions. Do those opposite know why the British parliament has supplementaries? It is because it does not have questions without notice; it has questions on notice. In advance of the Prime Minister's or any other minister's section, the members put down a question on notice. When they ask that question, which is usually a bland, general question, they get up and ask a supplementary, which is the real question. So they have one question and that is that. That proposition of the opposition is a load of nonsense. The opposition has performed miserably in question time. It is true that governments dominate question times—there is no question about that. Oppositions will occasionally have good days. I have a long enough memory to remember the Fraser government on the way out. We had a few wins but not on the majority of days. So governments dominate. Evidentally it is no secret on this side of the House, given the press I have read since then, that there is some disturbance. There are a few members on this side of the House who rather like the idea of throwing the Prime Minister a baseball bat before he walks into this place so he can beat the opposition all over the chamber on a daily basis. This point has been noticed by others. In today's Australian Financial Review , Tim Dodd says, `Keating prepared to risk question time dominance'. All this screaming is coming from those opposite who never ask the Prime Minister any questions in this place. They make demands of us and say, `Oh, you've got to be here to sit and listen to us ask everybody else questions, but we're not going to ask you any'. Everybody in the gallery and everybody out there knows that the Prime Minister doing what he is doing is probably acting to his political disadvantage—it may well be to his political advantage. As the honourable member for Bennelong pointed out, from time to time he has very successfully demonised foolish opposition policy. If the Prime Minister comes in this place and socks those opposite around the room or beats them around with a baseball bat, they do not do too well out of it. Members of the public may not like it much, but they sure as heck have those opposite defined for them. When they have an opportunity of having those opposite defined for them, they know exactly what they ought to do about them. Members of the public have done about those opposite that thing that they ought to do about them repeatedly over the last five elections. Those opposite have absolutely no compunction at all about ducking the Prime Minister whenever the opportunity arises. When they are presented with a serious bit of parliamentary reform on a trial basis, no doubt there will be a few people around the place on a trial basis who, when not being beaten around the chamber with a baseball bat, will come in and suggest that we ought change it back to the question time that we have experienced to this point. I will conclude on one of the final pieces of obsession in the effort to paint the Prime Minister engaging in an imperial presidency. The Leader of the Opposition says that all this emanates from the oval office. A vast array of reforms are being put in here. Virtually, all of them that are in the Blewett report are being implemented. As far as I am concerned, I have heard the term `oval office' applied to the last three Prime Ministers. I have not been around to hear that term applied to any of their predecessors, but I suspect it was used then too. It is a very common term used around the place and it proves absolutely nothing about what the Leader of the Opposition had to say. This is an unfortunate opposition. It is an opposition which regularly has been badly beaten. It is an opposition which now has presented to its backbenchers, and ours, an opportunity to do some decent scrutiny of government. Those opposite ought to seize it with both hands.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","161","0","Mr SINCLAIR","5E4","(New England)","NP","N/A","632","—The brief will do. He spent 80 per cent of the time defending the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), 20 per cent of the time defending the British parliamentary system, and about half a minute on changes to the present standing orders of the parliament. We have to understand what this is all about. First of all, it is the timing of the introduction of these changes and, secondly it is their content. If we put those into perspective, we will understand just where we are. I am delighted to see the audience. This is an example of the respect the government gives this institution.  When looking at how this is done, we have to understand that, from the very beginning, the Labor government has tried to denigrate the parliament. To my mind, that is part of the problem in the changes now being introduced. Let us go back to the timing. At present there is one minister on the run. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has demonstrably not answered a succession of questions to her about the administration of $30 million worth of public money. On a number of occasions if she has not misled the House, she could have fooled me. She certainly has gone to a point where everybody out there, including the major media around Australia, says she should have resigned. Had she followed the example of the former Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), or the example of Senator Richardson, she would now no longer be a member of the Keating ministry. The difficulty is in the timing. The government is presenting changes when it is already hiding from the accountability that a democratic system brings. Let us look at the content. People should not be fooled by any suggestion of reform. The people up there in the gallery, the people who come to this place to try to see what their Australian institution of democracy is all about, want to see honourable members talking about the factors that affect them, such as the standard of living that has fallen in the 10 years of Labor government and the issue of jobs. They do not want to worry about the jobs for the boys like the Comptroller-General of Customs, who somehow or other has been dismissed but, unlike all those others who have been given suspension notices, apparently is to be appointed to a position which may well give him a higher return than did the position from which he has been sacked. The changes that this government seeks to make are not going to enhance either the accountability or the responsibility of the ministry. We have a system where ministers are part of the parliament. Nobody in the Australian parliamentary system can remain a minister unless he or she is elected either to the Senate or to this House. Sure, the Prime Minister calls the Senate unrepresentative swill, but do not forget that the product of these changes is to enhance the power of the other place. All the Prime Minister is doing is giving that place a greater opportunity to sit in committee, a greater opportunity to consider legislation and an opportunity to debate the nuances of legislation, as I am sure my friend the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) will endorse. The Prime Minister has ensured that the unrepresentative swill will more and more assume the responsibility that people expect of this place. The people up there in the gallery want consideration of issues which are important to people. They do not want abusive language. They do not want a concentration on personalities. They want people who will be able to debate the issues. What do they want of their ministry? They want two things. They want ministers who are responsible and who will deal sensitively and sensibly with questions put to them. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that since 13 March honourable members on this side have not put one question to the government which has not been dealt with other than by way of a political exercise. Look at the Hansard record of any of the responses given by the Prime Minister or his ministers. They try to pick up not on what they are doing but on the policies that we have on this side, or they abuse individuals. Today—this is a classic example—the Prime Minister was asked a proper question about a sensitive environmental issue. What did he do? He gave the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) a half-hour lecture on information which is already disclosed in the registrar of pecuniary interests. The public want ministerial responsibility and also ministerial accountability. We are not like the Americans who have a system whereby the members of the administration are called before various committees, at which they give detailed answers. The only opportunity we, as representatives of the people of Australia, have is within this place. Ministers do not come along to parliamentary committees. We have heard the government's views on that. Ministers do not appear in any forum other than this where there is any opportunity to pursue in depth, in detail or in reason the sorts of responsibilities that we have seen the minister for the environment avoid.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

The point that the honourable member needs to understand is that, within this place, it is very important that ministerial accountability and ministerial responsibility are enhanced, not lessened. When we look at the detail of these amendments, we find that there is to be a roster of ministers. Look at that in terms of accountability. We have a minister under some form of scrutiny—the minister for the environment, sports rorts and whatever. As my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) pointed out, when it was suggested by the committee that there should be some capacity to amend the roster in order that a minister or the Prime Minister under persistent scrutiny on a sensitive policy issue might be called to the House, the response was, `Oh, no, that cannot be done'. So we are getting changes designed to meet the imperial manifestations that we see in the person who leads the government and a desire to avoid public accountability and public responsibility.  It is sad for Australian democracy. I read with some delight the introduction of the prime ministerial statement yesterday. It contained some very high sounding words, such as `the institution of democracy'. We like phrases such as that, but what do they mean to the Labor Party? Not a whit. Since Mr Wran was Premier of New South Wales, it has been politics and personalities that count, not policy. The tragedy is that, under the present Prime Minister, it has been developed into an art form. These changes to our standing orders are going to reduce the availability of ministers of this chamber, lessen their accountability to the public and ensure that where one minister or another has abused the processes of their position they will not be able to be examined in the way that they should. Honourable members might say, `But does that happen?'. I have already given two instances. Where personal profit conflicts with public responsibility, under a democratic system, this is the only venue where the public's interest can be pursued. Sadly, these changes to our standing orders will reduce the availability of scrutiny of the ministry. It is sad to think of the way in which the Leader of the House and the government are approaching this whole question. We heard the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House talk about the number of questions that have been put to the Prime Minister. We can tell all sorts of things with statistics. Let us look at them. We were told that only 18 per cent of questions were asked of the Prime Minister. If honourable members look at the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure, they will see that it made a big thing of this. Supposedly, questions were put only to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. Why is that the case? It is because 90 per cent of questions put to government ministers are dorothy dixers. Every question asked by government members is not a question wanting some sort of an explanation of policy. It is a question asked to basically avoid giving a ministerial statement which is the way by which we can get some sort of a reasonable answer. Take today's statement by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). He was saying that he would like to hear our view on this. I am sure that the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), would be delighted to give him our view about the government's program on foreign aid. There is a real problem in getting an opportunity to debate sensitive issues of that nature. If ministers want to present a statement and get our view, we would be delighted to give it to them. They have avoided ministerial statements. They have used more guillotines than we have even contemplated. They have gone to a system whereby, for the first time, in 1993 matters of public importance and the suspension of standing orders were removed. The government is pandering to that imperial tendency of the man who, for the time being, is its leader. These changes do not benefit democracy. They lessen the accountability of the ministry and they are regressive to the institutions of democracy in this place and deserve to be thrown out in their totality.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","164","0","Mr LEO McLEAY","4I4","(Watson)","ALP","N/A","634","—This has been an interesting debate so far. We heard the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) try to rewrite history and we heard the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) try to get some of the dirty water off his chest about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I remember the honourable member for Bennelong, as other honourable members would, in the early 1980s when his career was on the ascendancy. He used to get around the chamber fairly happily. He used to get around the old building fairly happily. He used to put on nice parties now and again and invite members of the opposition as well as members of the government.  With the 1987 election came a massive change in the personality of the honourable member for Bennelong. The 1987 campaign in New South Wales, in which the honourable member for Blaxland, the Prime Minister, was the most prominent player, had a lot to do with his problems. Unfortunately, we have since seen the career of the honourable member for Bennelong languish. The honourable member for Bennelong is probably one of the more intelligent people on the other side; he certainly has ideas which he gets out and promotes. I think a lot of his ideas are wrong, but he does promote his ideas. The honourable member for Bennelong has now reached the stage where, as the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) said, he has this terrible obsession with the Prime Minister. That is unfortunate, because I think it diminishes the honourable member for Bennelong, and it also diminishes a lot of people on the other side who have the same view. It was interesting to hear what the honourable member for Bennelong had to say, because the basis of this MPI is supposed to be that the Prime Minister will not be here every day for question time, but most of his arguments were about how terrible it is when the Prime Minister is here. The honourable member for Bennelong said, `It's awful. He comes in here and he does this and he does that, and he says this and he says that, and he is here every day to torment us, and he never gives us a fair go'. And on he went. The proposal is that we do give the opposition a fair go. Members on this side—and I think some of those opposite—are starting to believe that the opposition members are terrible masochists because they come in here each day and feed a line to the Prime Minister, who then gives them a little reminder of what it was like when they were all going to boarding school. I suppose some of them went to boarding schools where they were beaten every day—and liked being beaten every day—so each day the Prime Minister reminds them of that. The honourable member for Bennelong said, `It's terrible that he does that, but it is also terrible that he is not going to be here every day to do it'. The honourable member for Bennelong cannot have it both ways. We heard the honourable member for Bennelong talking about arrogance. He said that the Prime Minister is terrible in that respect. I recall, as he might, when he sat on this side in a very prominent position—in the front row, behind the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser—and we used to try to ask Malcolm Fraser questions. The right honourable member for New England was there too. He was one of the people who would say to Malcolm every day, `Don't answer the question'. When the then Leader of the Opposition would ask the then Prime Minister a question, the right honourable member for New England would have poor old silly Tom McVeigh answer it because Malcolm did not want to answer questions. So, if opposition members want to talk about how terrible it is that the Prime Minister comes in here and answers their questions, they ought to remember that they had a Prime Minister who was not even willing to answer questions from honourable members in this House. He used to sit there arrogantly with his back to the Speaker of the day, Billy Snedden, whom he hated and would not even look in the eye; he would look the other way and not even bother answering the questions. Who was putting him up to that? The right honourable member for New England, who wants to forget all about these things and talk about the good old days. The good old days that he wants to talk about are some reminiscences with the nasty little things that he did blotted out. He can get away with this with a lot of people, but the trouble is that a lot of these things are in the records. He should look at them before he starts writing these rosy little glowing stories about what it was like when he was a decent person. It is pretty hard for many of us to remember when he ever was, and he will not go out of this place with our thinking that he is. The person who was behind him, doing this as well, was the honourable member for Bennelong. We never heard the honourable member for Bennelong say, `Malcolm, you'd better get up and answer those questions. This is terrible, Malcolm; you're sitting there with your back to Billy'. The honourable member for Bennelong sat in the front row and said, `This is terrific. Just bat those Labor blokes off real quick'. But it is awful when it happens to him, and that is what makes him so bitter and so unhappy. The trouble with both the honourable member for Bennelong and the right honourable member for New England is that they have the most flexible arguments that anyone could ever be asked to put up with. I wonder sometimes whether they even believe them themselves. The right honourable member for New England told us how terrible it was about the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). She is under attack and those opposite want her to go to a committee. She will not go—how shocking and terrible! It is pretty shocking and terrible when people will not go to a committee. Of course, when the right honourable member for New England was under attack, he would not go to a committee meeting; he would not go near the Senate committee that was looking into the Asia dairy scandal—not in a fit was he going to go near there! When the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer and a minister in the government, I did not hear him stand up and say, `Ian, you should go to that meeting. You had better go over there and be accountable'. Of course not. Those opposite had no intention of playing that game then, but now they have the hide to stand up here and say, `It won't be do as we did; it will be do as we say'. Flexibility of mind? Hypocrisy is probably more like it.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

These proposals will enable this chamber to go back to the way it probably should have worked in the rosy old days that the right honourable member for New England cannot remember. For the last 10 years or so, question time in this chamber has not been a place where people come in, ask considered questions and get reasonable answers. The questions are not considered and the answers are too long. There is no doubt about that. The questions are all out of order. We hear statements—there are no questions involved in them. The ones that opposition members ask are not questions; they are statements of fact.  The new proposal will start to get question time back to the way it should be. If question time is about accountability, maybe some of the backbenchers should be able to have a go. In 1992, 70 per cent of the questions asked by the opposition were asked by three opposition office holders—the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party. Most of the opposition backbenchers never got to ask a question. In fact, I think one of the opposition frontbenchers never bothered asking a question. Whom were this opposition asking the questions of? Seventy per cent of the questions were to the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance or the Prime Minister. What about the rest of the ministers? They would come in here every day—day in, day out—and not receive a question. In fact, in 1992 the Minister representing the Minister for Defence was asked no questions, and last year he was asked one question. In 1992 the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was asked no questions, and last year he was asked one question. This shows how much the opposition cares about scrutinising ministers. Most of the junior ministers never received any questions. The rostering proposal will ensure that they do. Having a minimum of 14 questions will ensure that more questions are asked, and an extra day of question time will ensure that the opposition has more opportunities. If the truth were known, we would probably find that the reason opposition members think this is a bad idea is that they are so damned bone lazy and it will mean another day when they have to think up more puerile questions. The problem for them is that it will be another day when they will have to read the morning newspapers to try to think up what to ask at question time. The opposition would be far better off if it were to put a bit of effort into trying to make the system work properly rather than getting off on its terrible little hate about the Prime Minister and the fact that he is there and the honourable member for Bennelong and the right honourable member for New England are not. This system can work and it can work well. I believe it will be better than the current system. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins) —Order!

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","175","0","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","This bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate in that act two excise tariff proposals that have been previously tabled in the parliament. Excise tariff proposal No. 2 1993 proposed a reduction in the excise duty payable in respect of gasoline for use in aircraft, or avgas, and excise tariff proposal No. 3 1993 proposed an increase in the excise duty payable in respect of avgas and kerosene for use in aircraft, or avtur.  Avgas Clause 3 of the bill proposes a decrease in the excise duty payable in respect of avgas from $0.25456 per litre to $0.22443 per litre, a reduction of 3.013c per litre. This reduction is effective from 1 July 1993. This decrease results from three sources. The first is from the final stage of the government's program of transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership and encouraging owners of local ownership plan aerodromes to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. The second is the result of changes in cost-recovery arrangements for the provision of firefighting services by the Civil Aviation Authority. The third is the result of changes in cost recovery arrangements by the CAA in respect of the provision of meteorological services by the Bureau of Meteorology. Both the firefighting and meteorological services will now be directly charged to aircraft operators. The cost savings from these sources result in a corresponding reduction in the proportion of excise duty used to fund the aerodromes and the firefighting and meteorological services. This reduction in funding is then passed on to the aviation industry in the form of a decrease in the rate of excise duty payable on avgas. A decrease of 1.013c per litre is attributable to the aerodrome transfer program and the remaining 2c per litre reduction is attributable to the CAA in respect of firefighting and meteorological services. Clause 4 of the bill proposes an increase in the excise duty payable on avgas to $0.22999 per litre, an increase of 0.264c per litre. This increase was announced in the 1993 federal budget and is effective from 1 September 1993. The purpose of the increase is to enable the CAA to recover part of the costs of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry and is the first stage in a program to phase in recovery of the industry's contribution to these costs. Avtur Clause 4 of the bill also proposes imposing an excise duty of 0.264c per litre on avtur. This change was also announced in the federal budget. This imposition of excise duty on a product previously free of duty is to enable the CAA to recover part of the costs of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry and is in conjunction with the proposed increase in avgas. Financial Impact Statement Avgas The reduction of 1.013c per litre in respect of the transfer of ownership of aerodromes program will result in a reduction of revenue of $1 million in 1993-94 and $1 million in 1994-95. The combined decrease of 2c per litre from the changes in the CAA's cost-recovery arrangements in relation to firefighting services and meteorological services is balanced by an equivalent decrease in moneys appropriated to the CAA. The financial impact is neutral. The increase of 0.264c per litre is balanced by an equivalent increase in the moneys appropriated to the CAA. The financial impact is neutral. Avtur The imposition of 0.264c per litre is balanced by an equivalent increase in moneys appropriated to the CAA. The financial impact is neutral. I commend the bill to the House and present its explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Williams ) adjourned.","N/A","EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

Amendments to the Ministers of State Act 1952, which sets this sum, are thus required from time to time to cover changes to ministerial salaries. The sum appropriated is to meet the expected cost of salaries and no more. While the act covers the total cost of salaries, it does not set the amount of individual salaries to ministers.  The enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 has had, amongst other things, the effect of linking the basic salary levels for parliamentarians to the top of the Senior Executive Service band one level in the Australian Public Service. There is also a similarly proportioned increase in the salaries of ministers of state. Following the enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act, the government set in train arrangements to ensure that the relativities established between the salaries of parliamentarians at that time are maintained. That is, ministers' salaries are increased at the same rate and at the same time as salaries of senators and members of the parliament increase. Ministers receive the same increase in additional salaries as members of the parliament and are phased in in the same way. Increases of the same order and timing for office-holders of the parliament, including the opposition leadership, derive from the Remuneration and Allowances Act, and funds for those increases are appropriated by that act. The amount proposed to be appropriated accords with increases awarded to members of the parliament arising from increases of 1.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent ratified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for members of the Senior Executive Service of the Australian Public Service effective from 10 March 1993 and 11 March 1994 respectively.

Soon after the last federal election, I represented the House of Representatives, and Senator Colston represented the Senate, at the conference of the 89th IPU in New Delhi. The program of the conference is enclosed in the report, which I am tabling.  The IPU is an international organisation which brings together representatives of the parliaments of sovereign states. It is the focal point for worldwide parliamentary dialogue on political, economic, social and cultural problems of international significance. One of the most important subjects which came before us at this conference was the situation in Yugoslavia. A motion to that effect was moved by the IPU. I served on the political committee which made a determination and was involved in the drafting committee. I had the opportunity to address delegates on this very sobering topic. Following the referral to the committee on political questions, international security and disarmament, I made the point that Australia is home to hundreds of thousands of people from Yugoslavia who represent all sections of the community. I noted that the Balkans have traditionally played a very important role in the determination of European history and that the present situation could be a major destabilising factor unless some solutions are found both internally and by the world community. Sadly, the simple fact of the matter is that, since the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, what is now taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is a small microcosm of the wider problems in what was formerly Yugoslavia. They present Europe with undoubtedly the most important threat to international security since the end of the Cold War. There are dangerous parallels between the Balkans and the Spanish Civil War. We should never lose sight of the fact that the Spanish Civil War was, in many respects, the introductory chapter to World War II. The Spanish Civil War saw the rise of fascism. It saw both the fascist states of Italy and Germany taking the side of Franco. The socialist states, led by the USSR, took the side of the government in Madrid. There is a very real risk that a similar situation could well develop in Yugoslavia, especially in the context of the close relationship between Russia and Serbia. It is in this context, therefore, that the world watches with growing horror the events which take place there almost daily. The events in Sarajevo and the series of massacres which have taken place there are worth noting in that context. In May 1992, a mortar attack killed 16 people queuing for bread. The so-called bread queue massacre helped convince the United Nations to impose sanctions on Serb-led Yugoslavia. In June 1993, 15 people were killed and more than 100 were injured when shells slammed into a crowd watching a soccer game near Sarajevo airport. On 12 June 1993, eight mourners were killed and five others were hurt in an artillery attack on a Muslim funeral at a Turkish cemetery. On 27 June 1993, an artillery shell killed seven young people aged from four to 22 in Sarajevo's old town, apparently while they were out in the street. On 22 November 1993, a Serb shell attack killed three people sledging on slopes in the city centre. On 22 January 1994, six children were killed and three were seriously wounded as two mortar bombs struck their sleigh run in a hilly residential district near Serb lines. On 4 February 1994, a mortar barrage killed nine people in a Sarajevo food queue. The shocking event of last weekend led to a substantial escalation in the numbers of people, particularly civilians, who are dying daily in the streets of Sarajevo. It is in that context that I made the observation at the conference that this civil war has been fought along ethnic lines. Indeed, the conflict in Croatia, and especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, since April 1992 has witnessed some of the worst inter-ethnic violence in the Balkans since the Second World War. This is not surprising, given the history of ethnic tensions and groups in the region, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina. For example, over 25 per cent of the Serb population of former Yugoslavia lives beyond the frontiers of Serbia proper, principally in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina form a complex mosaic of ethnic and religious communities. In 1991, the population was 43.7 per cent Muslim, 31.4 per cent Serb, 17.3 per cent Croatian and 5.5 per cent Yugoslav, which comprises those who do not regard themselves as belonging to any other ethnic group. The conflict has wreaked havoc on the civilian population of all the ethnic groups in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Muslim population of the latter republic in particular has endured a disproportionate amount of suffering. The debate in the IPU led to the passage of an important resolution in this context. It was supported by all the member states present except Yugoslavia. Apart from the obvious need to try to stabilise the situation, it also drew attention, for the first time in an international environment, to the need for an international condemnation of the systematic rape of women and girls in the former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It urged the belligerent parties immediately to cease violence against women and girls. The conference declared that the systematic rape of women and girls in armed conflicts is a war crime and must be designated as a crime against humanity under international law. These were some of the worthwhile and important elements of the resolution which was carried. As I have said, the resolution was carried virtually unanimously at the IPU conference. It demonstrates the considerable international concern which was evident last March and which is growing to the present moment. We expect it to reach a climax to some degree during the next few weeks, when the likelihood is that the United Nations will sanction the use of air power against the Serbs attacking Sarajevo. There is also the possibility of a withdrawal of Serbian and other artillery from the region, making Sarajevo essentially a UN protected city. The outcome of the results remains to be seen. It is an extremely complex conflict. Above all, we need to see a considerable degree of political will, both internally and externally, to try to solve some of these problems. If the parties principal to the problem do not wish to solve the problem, then it is very difficult for the world outside to do much about it.","N/A","DELEGATION REPORTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Redistribution committees for each state and territory subject to redistribution must be appointed `as soon as practicable' after the commencement of a redistribution. For a state, the redistribution committee must, under current legislation, include the Surveyor-General for the state, or the Deputy Surveyor-General if the Surveyor-General is unavailable.  However, both Queensland and Western Australia have abolished the office of Surveyor-General, leaving a doubt as to the legal composition of a redistribution committee in those states, and any others that follow a similar path. This bill provides for alternative arrangements to be made in these cases. The bill provides that, where there is no office of Surveyor-General in a state, the state minister responsible for land surveying and mapping matters may nominate the person who, in the opinion of that minister, holds the equivalent office or, if that person is unavailable, the person who holds the office equivalent to the office of Deputy Surveyor-General. If that person is also unavailable, or there is no such person, the Governor-General shall nominate a senior officer of the Australian Public Service from the state concerned. This will ensure that, under any scenario, an appropriate officer from the state concerned will serve on the redistribution committee for that state. Current population trends indicate a likelihood that a federal redistribution will commence early next month in Queensland, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. It is necessary that this amending legislation be in place by then. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","188","0","Mr CONNOLLY","QF4","(Bradfield)","LP","N/A","641","—As has just been noted, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to provide that where, in a state, there is no office of Surveyor-General, the membership of a federal redistribution committee for that state may include the person who, in the opinion of the relevant state minister, holds the equivalent office. Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, you, as a member of this House, would be well aware that the issue of reforms or amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act is always a matter of great sensitivity to the parliament because of its implications in relation to the democratic process.  The opposition has been concerned that there is a definitional problem in the bill which we would like to see clarified. For that reason, I foreshadow that we will be moving an appropriate amendment. As we see it, the legislation essentially proposes that an unidentified state minister can appoint someone that he or she thinks holds an office equivalent to that of Surveyor-General to this very important responsibility; namely, federal redistribution committees. This, of course, has been caused by the fact that two states, Queensland and Western Australia, have changed their arrangements over recent years and no longer have people with the clear title of Surveyor-General. While this is seen as a technical amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, nevertheless we are concerned to be in a position in which, effectively, ex officio appointments to federal redistribution committees can be made. Because of the discretion allowed to state ministers in determining who might hold such equivalent office—I might add that under the act the definition of `equivalent office' is extremely wide—we believe it would be preferable to specify the actual officers in the states of Queensland and Western Australia who should be appointed to federal redistribution committees, for example, the Director-General of Lands and the Chief Executive Officer of the Department of Lands Administration, respectively. Consequently, the opposition will be moving an amendment to that effect. I would also like to take this opportunity to make some general observations in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I think it is appropriate for two reasons. Firstly, I am a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters which is currently reviewing the activities of the last election. In due course we will be reporting to the House. I do not wish to cover the matters which will be contained in that report. However, a number of issues have been brought to my attention as the shadow minister responsible for the electoral act which have caused great concern to representatives of my party and the organisation of the Liberal Party across Australia in relation to the implementation of the act. I refer specifically to the problem of enrolment procedures. Basically, the Liberal Party believes that enrolment procedures should be tightened to protect the integrity of the roll. We do this in the belief that there appears to be a premise, which is certainly applied in the Electoral Commission, that people are inherently honest and, therefore, that presumption outweighs any likelihood of people being able to use the present system for illegal purposes. In other words, they have virtually turned the principle on its head in that those of us who are concerned that in fact this may have taken place are required to prove it. I think logic would have it that those who are responsible for the safeguarding of the law should be primarily responsible for making sure that there are no likely weaknesses in the administration of the law which would permit breaches to take place. Consequently, the Liberal Party does not accept that, while it is mandatory for recipients of social security, for example, to open bank accounts in order to receive payments and taxpayers to have a uniform tax file number and that under the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 all financial institutions are required to verify the identity of each signatory to a new account and each new signatory to an existing account, imposing suitable verification procedures for electoral enrolment should be seen as an outrageous invasion of privacy or administratively impossible. Putting it quite simply, we believe that the maintenance of accurate and honest electoral rolls is at least as worthy an objective as protecting tax revenues or preventing social security fraud. There are few, if any, pieces of legislation in this House of greater long-term significance than the electoral act. It is at the very basis of our democratic system. The fear on our part is that there is a growing perception in the community that there may be opportunities in the present system which could be used, if they are not being used now. The very fact that weaknesses exist would suggest that at some stage in the future an attempt may well be made to use those loopholes, if they are not already being operated on at the present time. In that context, we think it worth noting that under the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 there are a whole range of verifications required to establish identity, but those verifications are generally not required to establish identity for voting purposes under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. For example, under the Cash Transaction Reports Act people are required to demonstrate that they are who they say they are through the use of a passport, citizenship certificate, birth certificate, written references, driver's licence, public service ID, social security card, tertiary education ID, employment ID, letter from employer, rates notice, credit-debit cards and passbooks, and Medicare card. Consideration should be given to establish a similar procedure for enrolment purposes so that we can be certain—in so far as it is possible to be certain—that a person who claims to be a valid resident and a valid voter is able to verify not only their address but also who they say they are. As I said, this is certainly not the situation at the present time. For example, while the card which a new voter is meant to fill out asks them details such as date of naturalisation, there is apparently no system in place which actually requires that information to be verified. In other words, we can put down almost anything we like because the risk of being caught is virtually negligible. That is why, when people raise these issues with us, we believe there is a problem. Cross-checking details of electoral enrolments with state government utilities and other holders of relevant information, such as Australia Post and Telecom, are options which should be given serious consideration. For example, the Electoral Commission conducts habitation reviews. We support that because it is at least an increase in the level of scrutiny of details provided to the commission by new enrollees. Surely we should have a system in place now which enables the Australian Electoral Commission to utilise the additional material which is now available to state and federal authorities and which is relevant in the determination of whether people are eligible to vote. Colleagues have brought to my attention the fact that, when they send out mail across their electorates, in a not insignificant number of cases they receive a reply stating that the person is not known at that address. There have even been cases where people have followed up the alleged address only to find an empty field—nobody lives there; there is no house. At some stage a person has enrolled, obviously illegally, at an address that simply does not exist. The present system has been extremely slow in picking up these things. Certainly, there is no automatic generation of information which would make verification of an elector's identity clearer. A possible answer to this problem—many possible answers have been put forward by many people—is the use of electoral enrolment cards. We may need to adopt the system used in the United Kingdom—I note the difference—which has a voluntary electoral system as distinct from our compulsory electoral system. Prior to an election, the electoral enrolment card is sent out to everybody on the roll. Those cards which are sent back are prima facie evidence that the people are no longer at those addresses. So, to some degree, it has a cleansing effect. People who receive a card have to hand it in when they go to vote and, in return, they will receive their ballot paper. So a one for one relationship can be established at that level. While it is true that there is no perfect system, it has been put forward that that is one of the options worthy of serious consideration. The Liberal Party is also of the view that the time has come for the Electoral Commission to be subject to an efficiency audit. This was referred to in the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters around the time of the 1987 election. It recommended that the Auditor-General should revise his schedule of efficiency audits to cover the AEC. To date that has not occurred. Time is passing and we believe the time has come for the Auditor-General to carry out that efficiency audit. Another matter worthy of consideration which has arisen from the 1993 election—we are pleased to note this—is that the commission has made progress in overcoming some bipartisan concerns regarding polling day queues, which caused difficulties at the 1990 election, and the apparent slowness of vote counting which took place in 1990. In addition to that, there was a failure to undertake the two-party preferred counts at polling booths in 1990 and quality, quantity and timeliness of data available to political parties on election night in 1990 were lacking. Most of those problems were overcome in the March 1993 election, and that is a step in the right direction. The Liberal Party also recommends that section 118 (5) of the Electoral Act should be revised. This prevents a DRO removing a name from the roll between the issue of the writ and the close of polling, even though the DRO has already determined that the name should be removed. In other words, the DRO has established that a person is no longer eligible to vote but, as the act stands at the moment, he or she cannot do anything about it. In South Australia alone I am advised that approximately 17,000 such enrolments at the time of the 1993 federal election, at least on a prima facie basis, were not entitled to vote in the electorates where the people were apparently registered. There are also problems in relation to mobile polling booths. This is a matter of some bipartisan concern to party workers. Difficulties include inadequate notice; some need for management discretion as to access by scrutineers; the potential for undue influence, especially in very small communities where people working at the booth may know virtually everybody who is going to vote; and the protection of the electors' right to maintain the secrecy of their ballot. These are all issues of considerable importance. No doubt we will be looking at them in detail in the context of the next election. Another matter which has continued to be raised is that of subdivisional voting. The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform in 1986 supported the changes to the subdivisional voting arrangements, but there is now a strong view that it would be preferable to go back to the old system where, effectively, we could require people living at a specific address to vote at their nearest subdivision rather than giving them the open sesame arrangements which currently stand. Subdivisional voting assists in limiting the capacity for electoral fraud and, for that reason, it should be reintroduced. The Liberal Party also believes that the issues surrounding citizenship and offers of profit under the Crown need to be much more clearly defined. In addition, current procedures need to be simplified with a view to clearly outlining what candidates may do in order to be properly qualified to stand for parliament. Recently we have had difficulties in regard to people involved in local government who wish to stand for higher office and the status that they may have in that context. Section 326, therefore, should be given very serious consideration in that context. The question of the bribery procedures of the electoral act is also relevant. My party submits that these procedures require review. We have reached an interesting situation now. If we put on a sausage sizzle during an election campaign and invite a bunch of taxi drivers to come and have a free sausage, that can automatically place us in a position where we are acting outside the act and are, therefore, breaching it. These are the sorts of issues which need to be looked at in a practical sense. I would like to refer specifically to a number of other matters. One of the problems we have had since the election has been the question of the Labor Party's involvement in the Centenary House arrangement whereby the Commonwealth Auditor-General was taken on as a tenant. I raised this matter with the Electoral Commission to establish whether or not there could be a breach of the act—in particular, the question of section 287, which defines a gift and disposition of property. The important thing is that the ALP receives contributions from its company, John Curtin House Ltd, and around the time of the last election John Curtin House Ltd gave $225,000 to the ALP. My contention was that John Curtin House has received rental income from the lease of Centenary House to the Australian National Audit Office since at least 23 September 1992. This lease contains an unparalleled nine per cent ratchet clause, providing annual rental increases of nine per cent for 15 years with no downward review of the market. I raised with the Electoral Commission the question of whether or not the income received from the Australian Labor Party from this lease of Centenary House to the Australian National Audit Office could constitute a gift, as defined in section 287 of the act. Under the act, a gift includes any disposition of property made by a person to another person and the term `disposition of property' is defined as including the grant or creation of a lease. I report that this was not agreed to by the Electoral Commissioner, who did not consider that a negotiated lease, such as the one relating to Centenary House, fitted this definition. However, I am pleased to note that the Auditor-General has announced that there will be a major inquiry into the whole background of this matter. A draft of the terms of reference for the inquiry into Centenary House has now been prepared, which reads:","N/A","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

That inquiry, I gather, has been agreed to by the government and will proceed.  Another matter—again in terms of an amendment to the act—which I think is worth looking at and which is locked in, so I am assured by the commissioner, concerns the current requirement by the Electoral Act that anyone who spends more than $200 on advertising in relation to an election during an election period must submit a return. This has had the most comical and stupid results. The AEC claims that it has no discretion to decide whether an election style advertisement is a gimmick and so demands returns from anyone who spends, as I have said, over $200.

It is not offensive to anybody in this House. I sincerely hope that it is not offensive to the honourable member.  We have reached the absurd situation where, if one puts in an advertisement, for example, that states `Election giving you a headache?

Many of the matters that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has raised I would anticipate we will discuss when the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters places its report before the House. Some of the matters that he raises I have no problems with. I certainly do have problems with other matters that he raises.  The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1993 contains a technical amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to remove any doubt surrounding the composition of a federal redistribution committee for a state. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Sciacca) pointed out, the problem has arisen because the bill provides that, where there is no office of surveyor-general in a state, the state minister responsible for land surveying and mapping matters may nominate the person who, in the opinion of that minister, holds the equivalent office or, if that person is unavailable, the person who holds the office equivalent to the office of deputy surveyor-general. If that person is also unavailable, or there is no such person, the Governor-General shall nominate a senior officer of the Australian Public Service from the state concerned. This will ensure that, under any scenario, an appropriate officer from the state concerned will serve on the redistribution committee for that state. The reason for that is that problems do arise in Western Australia and Queensland. Both Queensland and Western Australia have abolished the Office of Surveyor-General, leaving a doubt as to the legal composition of a redistribution committee in those states. I note that the opposition will be moving an amendment which is in different terms to the bill that the government has introduced into the House. It is a bit more than just semantics. I understand that the opposition moved the same amendment in the Senate and it was rejected. I think the concerns are basically that the amendment that the government is placing before the House—and I think it is worth while reading it into the record—relates to section 60 (2) of the principal act. It says:","N/A","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","196","0","Mr MELHAM","4T4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I think that is a much more satisfactory amendment than the one the opposition will place before the parliament today because it really captures everything. If there is a change in name or title in the current states which have the title Surveyor-General, the government's amendment basically picks up that position. It allows the relevant state minister to nominate the person holding the equivalent office. The problem with the opposition's amendment is that it keeps the specific title Surveyor-General for the remaining states and territories, but it then is too specific in nominating for Western Australia the Chief Executive Officer of the Department of Land Administration and, in the case of Queensland, the Director-General of Lands.  I suggest to the opposition that, on a close perusal of the amendment that the government has placed before the parliament, the words the government has used are far superior. What could happen with the opposition's amendment is that it could require further amendments in this parliament if changes in names and titles are made by the respective state parliaments. Redistribution committees really are a product of an earlier report of this parliament. I think we should continue to place on record the tremendous effort of the former member for Prospect, Dr Dick Klugman, who in the mid-1980s devoted himself to electoral reform. Long-standing members of the House and others who have an interest in electoral reform would know that in the old days when redistributions were held, they were basically presented to the parliament and it was actually the parliament that voted on the redistribution maps. They were initially published and then there was an objection phase but it was the parliament that decided on the boundaries for members of this House. It was not till the mid-1980s that it was handed over to the Electoral Commission. The redistribution committee, as it stands under section 60 of the act, has on it the Electoral Commissioner, the Australian Electoral Officer for the state, the Surveyor-General for the state and the Auditor-General of the state. It is independent and the states have a role. That is why they get to nominate in these instances. I suggest to the opposition that its fears in terms of the technicalities are not substantiated on a close reading of what we have put before the parliament. I think the government's amendment will obviate the need for future amendments if there is a change in title. So I ask the honourable member for Bradfield to reconsider the opposition's amendment in the light of what I have had to say. I think it is worth while placing on the record how redistributions are carried out. I do that in light of the fact that, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security has pointed out, redistributions in Queensland, Victoria and the ACT will be necessary if current population trends continue. A redistribution is carried out in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and there are a number of stages, including opportunities for public participation. Step one involves public suggestions. Before the redistribution committee makes its proposal, any interested persons or organisations which wish to make suggestions regarding the redistribution, and in particular possible boundaries or names of divisions, are given 30 days to forward them in writing to the redistribution committee. Step two involves comments on the public suggestions. These suggestions will then be made available for public inspection. Interested persons or organisations may make comments on these suggestions and any comments on the suggestions must be lodged in writing within 14 days. Step three is the initial redistribution proposal. The committee considers the public suggestions and comments before making a proposed redistribution. Maps showing the proposed boundaries and names of divisions will then be published and exhibited at offices of the Australian Electoral Commission. Step four involves objections to the redistribution proposal. Following the publication of the initial proposed redistribution there will be 28 days within which objections to the proposed redistribution may be lodged by members of the public or organisations. Step five involves the augmented electoral commission for each state or the ACT considering objections lodged. The augmented electoral commission for each state or the territory consists of the members of the redistribution committee for that state or territory plus the two members of the Australian Electoral Commission who were not on the redistribution committee—the chairman, the Hon. Trevor Morling QC, and Mr Ian Castles, the Australian Statistician. The augmented electoral commission has 60 days to consider the objections, including initial and any further objections. It must hold a public inquiry into any objection unless it is of the opinion that the objection deals with matters which were covered in an earlier submission or comment or is vexatious or frivolous. Step six involves the revised redistribution proposal and further objections. After concluding its inquiries into initial objections the augmented electoral commission makes public its proposed redistribution for the state or territory. If its proposals differ significantly from the redistribution committee proposals, it will invite further comments and hold an inquiry into any further objections. Step seven involves the final determination. After considering any further objections, the augmented electoral commission makes a final determination by notice published in the Gazette . The notice states the names and boundaries of the electoral divisions into which the state or the ACT is to be distributed. Such a determination must be made as soon as practicable after all objections have been considered using the same determination criteria as were used by the redistribution committee. Parliament has no power to reject or amend the final determination of an augmented electoral commission. So what we are doing here tonight is not changing any of the steps in the redistribution process. This is why we are basically having a semantic argument between the opposition and the government as to the correct words to be used. My objection to the amendment moved by the opposition is that again it particularises specific titles in terms of Western Australia and Queensland. It is my view that the government amendment is more preferable because it talks about the existing position of Surveyor-General so that if the position of Surveyor-General is reconstituted in Queensland or in Western Australia, it is picked up. But we have a fall back position in our amendment, which is not really picked up all that well in the opposition's amendment, that says if there is no office of Surveyor-General for the state, the person nominated by the relevant state minister is the person holding the office equivalent to the office of Surveyor-General for the state. Basically, if the state minister nominates those offices particularised in the opposition's amendment, they will be picked up. In my view, we have one of the best electoral systems in the world. I think it is one that we should be proud of in terms of redistributions at a federal level. I am not talking about Western Australia, because I do not believe that in Western Australia they do have one vote, one value. However, at the Commonwealth level we do. I think credit needs to go to both sides of the parliament. Our Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters works well. This is my second term as a member of parliament and I was on the old committee in the last parliament. There is lot of bipartisan support for amendments to the electoral act and a lot of agreement between members of the government and the opposition. We are about trying to achieve a fair result; we are not about trying to subvert the will of the people—and that has been obvious. The honourable member for Bradfield and I have differences of opinion in some areas but I think those differences are really around the edges. Too often there is the perception in the community that all we do here is fight one another tooth and nail. In recent times a lot of the material that has come before us—and this is really in that category—especially in relation to electoral matters, has had bipartisan support. There is some difference of view in terms of compulsory voting and other matters and we will be arguing about those I am sure when the committee's report is tabled. There is very little else to say, but I repeat my earlier request to the opposition to reconsider its amendment because I do not think that it is superior to what the government is putting before the parliament this evening. For that reason I certainly will not be supporting the opposition amendment.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/para[9]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","205","0","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The primary purpose of this bill is to establish the Australian Space Council.  Background Australia was one of the first countries to take an interest in space. It participated in the British and United States missile development programs and then in the European space program during the 1960s and 1970s using Woomera for rocket launches. During this period Australia became only the third country in the world to build and launch its own satellite from its own soil. However, for various reasons, Australia has not been able to capitalise on the early start. Nevertheless, Australia is a major user of space technology. We are a world leader in radio astronomy and we were a foundation member of Intelsat and Inmarsat. The Australian government commissioned its domestic satellite system, now operated by Optus Communications. We are major users of remote sensing data in agriculture, fisheries, mining and forestry, for environmental monitoring and control, disaster situations and urban planning, as well as for meteorology. Following the Madigan Report in 1985, the government formed the Australian Space Board to manage the national space program. In 1988, the board was asked by the government to review the program content of the national space program. This was conducted in 1991-92 by an expert panel. The expert panel's report, An Integrated National Space Program , was tabled by a former industry minister, former Senator Button. In 1992, the government generally accepted the panel's recommendations. One of the organisational recommendations was to replace the existing Australian Space Board with an Australian Space Council embodied in legislation. This bill gives effect to that recommendation. There has been some delay in bringing this bill before the House because of the intervening election. However, in order to maintain the impetus of the national space program, the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce established the Space Council under administrative arrangements. Functions and Powers The functions and powers of the council are set out in part 2 of the bill. These provide for the minister to refer matters on space related science and technology to the council for inquiry and report. The council is to develop and recommend to the minister a national space program which covers the space activities of both the public and private sectors. The council is also required to review and report to the minister on the outcomes of the national space program. Because the space industry is fragmented between the Commonwealth and states, public and private sectors and industry and academia, it is essential that there be strong coordination and consultation mechanisms established to ensure the national space program reflects all interests. These requirements are explicit functions of the council. In short, the council is to add value to Australia's expenditure in space related activity and extend the opportunities for private investment and wealth creation in international markets and in import replacement. It must advise on policy and its implementation. Importantly, it must create a basis for rational cooperation between agencies responsible for public investment. The national space program has to be truly national, not just a Commonwealth program. The principal source of funding for the national space program comes from the Commonwealth, so it is appropriate that the minister have a power of direction over the council. There is provision for the council to report on any direction given unless this would be prejudicial to Australia's national interest. Five-Year Plan The council is engaged in developing a five-year plan, which will chart the future direction of the national space program. I am pleased to report that the council has been consulting with the states and industry over the past few months while preparing the first five-year plan. I know that good progress has been made and an interim report was provided on 31 May 1993. The production of a rolling five-year strategic plan is an important task placed on the council and is the means by which the national space program is implemented. Membership of Council Part 4 of the bill deals with constitution, meetings and committees of the council. The major user of space in Australia at the moment is the Commonwealth. However, as mentioned, this use is fragmented across many departments and agencies. It is proposed that departments with a significant interest in space be full members of the council. This will provide for a high level of coordination at the government level for the definition of public sector requirements and contrasts with the previous space board where a number of departments had only observer status and, as a consequence, were not seen as full stakeholders in the national space program. Full membership of the council by stakeholder government departments was one of the expert panel's recommendations. Currently, senior officers of the departments of Industry, Technology and Regional Development; Transport and Communications; Defence; Arts and Administrative Services; the Environment, Sport and Territories; Primary Industries and Energy; and the CSIRO are members of the council. Appropriate ministers will be consulted on the government appointments to the council. The bill also provides that, as far as practicable, the minister ensure that the majority of members be drawn from industry and research institutes and that the council should have an independent chair. These measures will ensure that government members do not dominate the council. The mix of membership between government, industry and academia will allow coordination between public and private sector space activities. Funding Currently, the direct cost of the national space program administered by the council is $6.064 million per year. The council is supported by staff provided by the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development in the Australian Space Office, which is the executive arm of the council. In addition, the office is responsible for the management of the Canberra deep space communication complex at Tidbinbilla, which is run on behalf of the United States National Aeronautical Space Administration. The value of the NASA contract is about $15 million per year. The amount provided for the national space program is modest, but the product spin-off from space industry development is significant. The work of the council in developing its five-year strategic plan will, it is hoped, lead to an expansion of the national space program. Review In accordance with the government's policy on evaluation of programs at least every five years, it is intended to establish an independent expert panel to formally review the national space program for consideration by government before March 1998. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

Land, sea and air have been joined by this vast arena of expanding human activity. In the years ahead, there is no doubt whatever that these activities, both public interest and commercial, will continue to expand.  The scale of these activities at present would surprise many who still think of space as an arena for the major powers but not for medium sized nations such as Australia. It is true that the formal government administered Australian space program is relatively modest in size with a current annual expenditure of some $6 million. Beyond that, however, the CSIRO spends some $30 million a year on space related activities. Indeed, some 19 of its 35 divisions are involved in one way or another in space. The NASA contract to operate the Canberra deep space communications complex at Tidbinbilla is, as has been said, worth an additional $15 million a year. The rapidly expanding telecommunications system in this country, relying increasingly as it does on satellite provided services, involves huge investments on the part of Telecom and Optus in space activities. An increasing number of Australian companies have also invested in space related technology. When all of this activity is taken into account, the space and space related sector in Australia may—this is one estimate that I have heard—be worth up to half a billion dollars a year, although this expenditure is obviously rather lumpy expenditure involving some large individual items. But it does indicate that space is a significant arena these days for national activities and one whose policy implications merit wide understanding and careful analysis. There is no single generic technology that is space technology. Instead, space equipment rests on a broad range of leading edge technologies such as electronics, communications, advanced materials, cryogenics and advanced propulsion. The space industry is closely linked to other major sectors, particularly aerospace and electronics. Nor should we think that all the space related activities of Australian industry, science and government occur in space. Much of it actually occurs on the ground in the form of ground stations or terminals connecting with satellites, and the reception and analysis of satellite data. The pattern of Australian activity in space of course has a different shape to that of the space activity of the major powers where huge government expenditures for defence and national prestige have underpinned pioneering efforts. The international space industry has four main areas of operation: the development and manufacture of satellites for use in areas such as telecommunications, earth observation and weather forecasting; the manufacture and launch of vehicles to place these satellites in orbit; the construction of ground stations to communicate with the satellites and to receive information; and the provision of related services such as satellite tracking and control services, telecommunications and remote sensing. The publicly and specifically identified annual budget of the Australian space program is tiny by international standards, though the figure of $6 million is, for the reasons I have stated, misleadingly small. Sweden and Canada spend approximately $A122 million and $A270 million on their respective space programs. It would be a great mistake, however, for Australia to conclude that the scale of its program should somehow or other be based on similar rates of per capita expenditure to those in other countries. The key issue is ensuring that Australia can operate effectively in the domain of space in a way which specifically meets our needs. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said, as a nation Australia needs to develop a long-term vision and strategy for its scientific research and development of technology. There is a striking contrast here between the Leader of the Opposition, who has a real personal interest in this area, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who apparently has none, and the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht), the Prime Minister's numbers man, who in many ways would seem to be a negative quantity. At present, there is no such vision, I regret to say, on the part of the government. The sad fact is that there is a wide sense of disillusionment about the future among many of this country's most outstanding researchers and technologists. The so-called brain drain has become a national disgrace as many of Australia's top minds are forced to pursue their careers in other countries because they cannot find opportunities here and because they do not know what the future holds. Australians are rightly deeply concerned that we seem to be unable to develop many of the innovations produced by Australian research in this country and for this country, that so many are lost to overseas and that so few of the benefits flow to Australia. Australian achievement in space related activities is an area in which there is a need for vision, a longer term strategy which will ensure that there is a proper sense of direction, and an avoidance of undue fragmentation of effort which undermines the best use of the scarce resources which are available. In assessing this and any other legislation which comes before this House which implements policy in this area, it is important to assess it against some fundamental policy principles. I briefly wish to outline what some of these principles are. The key role of government in the development of Australia's space related activities is to ensure that Australia's overall economic welfare is maximised. As was pointed out in the evaluation of Australia's space program by the Bureau of Industry Economics, government expenditure to assist industry is only justified from an economic perspective if the private sector would fail to generate the patterns of activities which would maximise Australia's overall economic welfare and if government can improve outcomes in a cost effective way. There are obvious public good and infrastructure aspects to the activities carried out in space, particularly in Australia's case in relation to mapping, communications, weather and disaster forecasting, search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and public sector research. These public good and infrastructure aspects of the space program in this country have become of great significance to many Australian industries and to the whole community, allowing the more effective planning of the development of both private sector and communities. Conversely, it is important that government activity does not operate to squeeze out or crowd out private sector activity which might otherwise produce significant commercial returns to Australia, which could happen if government entered areas where it competed unfairly with private activities. From an economic point of view, it is vital that the space program be private sector driven and, in the evaluation of the work of the Space Council, it is a responsibility ultimately incumbent on the minister to ensure that this is the case. Again, as the Bureau of Industry Economics also pointed out, government expenditure may also be justified where there:","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","206","0","Dr KEMP","BT4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Australia has developed outstanding technical skills in the CSIRO and elsewhere and there are many who will want to see Australian technology in space in the future, including instruments fully developed and built in Australia. The challenge is to strike the appropriate balance between all these objectives and to ensure that funding arrangements and organisational structures are best suited to allow optimal performance in each area.  In the development of a framework for the future development and planning of the space program, it is essential that the structures established avoid the twin evils of over-centralisation on the one hand and excessive fragmentation of effort on the other. Achieving this balance is a significant challenge which faces the organisation dealt with in the legislation before the House today. It is also important, in a funding sense, to ensure continuity of funding to allow for a degree of certainty in planning for both the public and private sectors. As the Australian Space Board has noted in the past, uncertainty over funding made it difficult to draw up new programs and to pursue existing projects in an atmosphere of stability. The purpose of the bill before the House today is to formally establish the Australian Space Council which has been operating under administrative arrangements since 1993. As the decision to establish the council was made during the caretaker period, the coalition was consulted and agreed to these arrangements. Reporting to the minister responsible for space activities, Senator Schacht, the council will advise on policy concerning Australia's role in space. The council is to develop and recommend to the minister a new integrated national space program which will cover space activities of both the public and private sectors. In addition, the council is to prepare a rolling five-year strategic plan that will include objectives, strategies, costs and benefits of the integrated national space program. The establishment of the council will involve ongoing annual running costs of $2.68 million per annum to cover administrative expenses, salaries and annual operating expenses. Unfortunately, it seems that Senator Schacht does not view this bill as of any great importance. The man who sees scientists as grey-haired men in cardigans and thinks that meeting with them is a bit boring was not even present in the Senate this week when the bill was being debated. I do not know why he was not present in the Senate. Following the release of the Madigan report, a working party of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences, the Australian Space Board was established in 1986 to provide a more structured national space effort and manage, pending a later review, the then year-old national space program. This review was subsequently conducted by an expert panel in 1991-92. The panel was chaired by Mr Jack Curtis, former Managing Director of Telecom and Chairman of Nortel Australia. Its other members were Dr L.W. Davies, former Chief Scientist of AWA, and Professor Roy Gibson, first Director General of the European Space Agency. This bill gives effect to one recommendation made by that expert panel. The panel's report, entitled An integrated national space program , provides a detailed analysis of the performance and direction of the national space program as it then existed. The expert panel found that the development of the national space program and the performance of the Australian Space Board, while not beyond criticism, had been largely successful in developing Australian space industry capability. It found that international markets for space-derived services were expanding rapidly and that `no modern nation' could:","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/para[14]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","206","0","Dr KEMP","BT4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The expert panel did, however, criticise the national space program for `an absence of any clear guidelines' leading to a `degree of duplication and overlap' which `militates against overall efficiency and produces a degree of waste'. It also noted that `efforts to exploit potentially significant opportunities for enhancing national welfare' were likely to be too little too late, due to the `lack of a national strategy and effective coordination'. It concluded also that levels of government funding were `inadequate'.  The report made some 13 recommendations aimed at building on the existing industry base and taking advantage of potential future industry opportunities. Key recommendations, in addition to the creation of the Australian Space Council, included, firstly, the adoption of an integrated national space program to ensure that Australia gain net community benefits from the use of space techniques in all areas of public and private sector endeavours in which space will have an impact; secondly, an increase in funding to $20 million per annum by 1994-95 with funding assured for a period of at least five years; thirdly, a concentration on priority areas such as mobile communications, earth observation and satellite-borne instrumentation and a move away from the earlier industry development objectives which had informed the space program; fourthly, science projects supporting the integrated space program should receive regular funding not below 10 per cent of the total annual budget; and, finally, continued funding support for a limited number of space industry development centres. The expert panel attached great importance to the new integrated national space program which it saw, together with private sector involvement, as providing an appropriate national space capability to convert Australia into an enlightened user of space techniques and services. Although paying some lip service to the strategy outlined in the expert panel's report, it must be pointed out that the government's current commitment falls well short of that recommended in that report, particularly in financial terms. The government clearly has had some ambivalence about the space program and its performance and dimension to date and has so far, I believe, been keener to be seen to be doing something than to make any hard or significant decisions in this area. This becomes clearer when we see the recommendations that were put forward in another report produced by the Bureau of Industry Economics. In parallel with the expert panel report, the Australian Space Board requested that the Bureau of Industry Economics undertake an independent economic evaluation of the national space program, the essence of which was a comparison of the costs incurred by the program with the economic benefits to Australia. A common theme in support of national space programs around the world is that space activity involves a range of leading edge technologies and that countries involved in these technologies will gain long-term advantages in terms of natural competitiveness. It is said that space R&D also enables industry to develop in a general sense by enhancing its technical and scientific capability. The spin-offs generated from such R&D can also be considerable. However, the BIE report found that, overall, no evidence could be found:","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/para[23]","N/A","N/A"

This is an area of particular concern to the coalition and, given that the Bureau of Industry Economics was unable to examine this issue in the depth it wanted to, it is certainly one which deserves further investigation and one which the council, being established by this legislation, will need to monitor.  The Bureau of Industry Economics did find, however, that through advances in science and the application of such advances in the area of remote sensing `significant, though intangible, benefits are derived by the Australian (and to a lesser extent the international) community'. As a result of its evaluation, the BIE recommended that funding for space industry development be subsumed into general industry development programs through `the existing range of industry assistance programs'. Given this recommendation, and the fact that Australia's main space interest is in the area of remote sensing, the BIE also recommended `new coordination arrangements for remote sensing'. In relation to the large number of science projects being pursued by the national space program, the Bureau of Industry Economics found that few science outcomes had been achieved and it recommended that `funding for space science be subsumed into general science funding' and be judged according to the same criteria as other science projects. It also recommended that the Australian Research Council be asked to consider whether space-related science should be designated as a priority subject area.

It is worth noting that neither the expert panel nor the government has wholeheartedly accepted the bureau's conclusions. In fact, in his second reading speech in the other place, Senator Sherry, who represented the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, made no mention of the BIE report. In the coalition's view, the overriding policy objective must be to ensure that Australia gains the maximum possible benefits from the use of space techniques. This is where the role of the council becomes critical.  The Space Council is chaired by Dr Don Watts, head of the Northern Territory Trade Development Zone Authority and former Vice-Chancellor of Bond University. Dr Watts is a person of vision and dynamism and he will doubtless be looking to put his stamp on the new council. Its other members are drawn from the research sector, from industry, and from major government agencies involved in space activities. The principal bureaucratic support for the council is provided by the Space Office in the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. The challenge is, of course, from this position in the department, to draw together and give coherence to activities which span a number of departments and agencies and to motivate each of the members to contribute their joint efforts to a coherent and focused public sector research program and public sector space program, and that it has the capacity to ensure that the private sector is the driving force in the development of commercially oriented value-added space related activities. Prior to the last election the coalition was of the view that there were advantages in passing the primary responsibilities for the national space program to the CSIRO's Office of Space Science and Applications, sometimes referred to as COSSA. This was to have been overseen by an active Space Council, as currently constituted. Since the last election there have been changes to the management and structure of COSSA and the management and nature of the Space Office. The Space Office is under new management and this new management is, I understand, working well with both the CSIRO and the Space Council. This is not to say that the present allocation of responsibilities between the Space Office and COSSA is necessarily appropriate. The CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications has a major responsibility for technological developments and it is important to ensure that there is not unnecessary overlap and duplication between the CSIRO and the programs supported by the Space Office, and that the Space Office has a proper focus for its activities. Equally, it is important that the capacity of the CSIRO to contribute to the development of space policy is fully utilised. The new Space Council may well consider the employment of COSSA on a consultancy basis in the development of its policy perspectives and future strategic plans. This week is, indeed, an important week in the development of the five-year rolling strategic plan by the new Space Council. I understand that the council will be putting its seal to the plan this week, and there will be great interest in the science community, in industry and in this parliament in the vision for the future development of the space program set out in this strategy and in the priorities for the program which the Space Council has decided to set. It is to be hoped that those priorities build on Australia's strengths and that the Space Council is able to use its leverage with its member departments to achieve greater focus in government sector contributions to the Australian space effort. The legislation under which this council is to be constituted provides the council with a level of independence in its capacity to advise the minister, though its structure falls well short of an independent statutory authority. The coalition will be subjecting both the structure of the council itself and the five-year strategic plan which it will propose to very close scrutiny and will measure it against the principles which I set out at the commencement of my speech. We will be assessing the extent to which the five-year plan facilitates the development of private sector value-added activity from our space involvement and the kind of commitment which the departments and agencies which are members of the council are prepared to make to achieve a balanced and integrated space program. I well remember, as I am sure many honourable members do, that momentous day in July 1969 when the Apollo astronaut Neil Armstrong took that first cautious step onto the lunar landscape. I was fortunate enough to be studying in the United States at the time and recall when President Richard Nixon spoke with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin from the White House while they were stationed at Tranquility Base on the moon. The mood was euphoric as the stunning significance of that one small step sank home. Since then space activity has become an every day affair, even though it is still in its early stages. It remains an exciting arena of fabulous opportunity for improving the conditions of mankind, for monitoring changes in the earth's climate, for finding the resources of the planet, for detecting changes—both favourable and adverse—in the biosphere, for improving communications within Australia and between Australians and the rest of humanity, for conducting the research, and for manifold other uses. Australia very much needs a vision of how all can benefit most from our activities in this arena. This legislation provides a framework for the formulation and implementation of a vision. It will be essential to keep it under close review and, at an appropriate time, to evaluate its performance. If it is not effective, then it will need to be changed.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/para[35]","N/A","N/A"

The Australian Space Council has come about because of constant pressure from many people to get our government interested in space. Our space budget is a miserly $6 million. Canada spends $270 million. If we spent that much, I have no doubt that we could launch more satellites—just as we did in the 1960s—and once again take a leading role in space exploration. Space Australia is an excellent book, put out by the Powerhouse Museum, that I believe everyone should read. It contains a history of the Australian space industry. It is a wealth of information for those who are interested in our space history. On 4 October 1957 the USSR launched Sputnik. I can remember watching it from my driveway in Moorabbin when I was 16 years old. From memory, it went from south to north. I remember wondering how anyone could have put this moving star into the sky. That triggered my interest in space and astronomy.

When Sputnik travelled over Australia in 1957, an Australian created a first by rushing out and taking out the world's first insurance policy against damage caused by a satellite.  Australia has a great record in this area. In 1957 we started launching rockets at Woomera. In 1967 Australia's first satellite, Wresat, was launched, and Australia participated in a global satellite television broadcast. In 1970 the Australis-Oscar-5 satellite was launched, also from Woomera. Every day every Australian makes use of satellites and of space. Weather maps, phones, news, crop management, navigation, animal tracking, resource recovery and many other things come from space. We were at the forefront, but we have fallen behind. Excuse the pun, but I hope the Space Council will be the launching pad for our space industry. I would like to go through some of our involvements with space in the past. I feel that this will give us a bit of an idea as to how far Australia was involved and that it will show the leading edge that we had in the 1960s and 1970s.

Most shipowners and people who do a bit of walking or any sort of navigation away from inhabited areas are aware of EPIRB emergency devices. When pressed, they will send a signal via a satellite and a location can be picked up very quickly. The average time taken to locate a distress signal anywhere in Australia and around its coastal waters is around three hours. It is estimated that by 1990 more than 1,000 lives had been saved by this device. This is something that has come about through space exploration.  Back in the 1980s we started a project called Starlab. I was very pleased to be involved with that project. I remember that I lobbied former Senator Button to make certain that money was forthcoming for the Starlab project, and much money was given to it. The project was funded by the government because of the potential that Starlab had to provide space qualifications experience to local industry, which Australia had lost due to the downturn in space activities in the 1970s. The Australian design studies for the project were well under way when the Canadian government decided to switch its space policy from Starlab to Space Station Freedom. However, the experience that we gained on Starlab was invaluable. It was used later in another project called Fuse Lyman. More recently it has been used in relation to the Hubble telescope. A lot of opportunities have been lost to Australia. Australia led the world in the 1960s in rocket guidance and optical tracking technologies. However, as activities at Woomera wound down, so did Australian research in this field. The technology was sold to Sweden to be utilised in European space programs. We had another opportunity in the area of space technology. There was talk in the 1970s of developing a geostationary launch facility near Darwin. However, this opportunity was also lost. I believe it was because of lack of funding and lack of interest by the conservative government of the time. What about our future in space? There are many areas in which we can be involved. With funding and support—hopefully from this reinvigorated Space Council—Australia could take advantage of many opportunities to develop and implement a very vibrant space program. It would utilise its special strengths and capabilities; meet the demands of the nation in the areas of development of communications, remote sensing and space science; and put the country back into the forefront of space activities. In 1992, the Year of Space Science, the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology put together a book called Looking back: the changing face of the Australian continent, 1972-1992 . It includes satellite photographs that are transposed upon each other and show the changes in the countryside all over Australia in that period. It is an extremely interesting book. It has got world acclaim. The CSIRO has done something that no country has done and many countries are now looking closely at it. When I read the introduction of this book, I was quite staggered to see some of the facts that the CSIRO has given.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","210","0","Mrs GALLUS","CU4","(Hindmarsh)","LP","N/A","659","—I enter the debate today on the establishment of the Space Council because of the implications this has for the environment. I want to take a totally different approach from that of the other speakers. Australia, as has been commented, is internationally prominent and innovative as a user of remote-sensing satellites. The Australian Centre for Remote Sensing, ACRS, in Canberra, is the principal organisation responsible for receiving, archiving and distributing remote-sensing satellite data in Australia. Data is received by the ACRS antenna at the data acquisition facility in Alice Springs, and then forwarded daily to the data processing facility in Canberra, where it is catalogued and archived.  Originally, the data came solely from the American Landsat satellite but later the French Spot satellites and the European ERS-1 radar satellite were brought in. These have added to the technology so we can actually have pictures at night and through cloud. The use of this ACRS data is particularly relevant to the environment in a whole range of areas. I will briefly touch on a couple of those areas. Firstly, in land management, the remote-sensing techniques provide an efficient means of assessing and monitoring the conditions of the rangelands. For instance, in Western Australia, images of the areas of severe degradation and erosion are at this moment being derived from the Landsat satellite. As well, in South Australia, a rangeland package to map grazing patterns and fodder availability has been developed, and this information is provided to graziers and pastoralists. Landsat is also used in water conservation. State water commissions use Landsat to supplement investigations into flood plain management, geological and ground water study, and increased alkalinity in soil. Landsat provides a means to monitor, at reasonably frequent intervals, the process of salinity as its spreads or wanes over vast areas of land. The New South Wales resources commission flood damage reduction program requires basic essential data on the inundation of flood plains, and much of this can be obtained inexpensively by remote sensing. Satellite imagery and special digital analysis techniques can be used to obtain the following information: delineation of flooded areas and floodways; the effects of levies, road embankments, irrigation channels and diversion works on flow distribution; and the performance of flood mitigation works. Vegetation such as forest, woodland, grassland and rangeland can be classified and larger areas can be mapped in a cost-effective manner. Aerial photography and data from digital scanning systems give resolutions that enable species composition, tree density and productivity measurements of forests to be made. Landsat imagery has been used to map vegetation types in the Mount Lofty ranges east of Adelaide and its accuracy has been better than 75 per cent. Landsat imagery is an important contribution to remote sensing and land resource analysis in its potential to monitor temporal changes that occur in surface conditions or land cover over extended periods. Forest defoliation caused by disease, insects, land clearing, fires and soil disturbances resulting from mining activity can all be identified on Landsat and monitored using multi-temporal imagery. The gradual deterioration in vegetation cover associated with dry conditions can also be studied using the satellite imagery. Finally, I refer to the uses in the environment for habitat. The remote-sensing data are used to monitor the effects on native vegetation of agricultural activities. They have also been useful in the management of insects or pests such as plague locusts. Landsat imagery has been used to identify and classify remnants of native vegetation in agricultural areas. Using colour infra-red aerial photography at a height of 1,500 metres, university researchers have developed a technique to identity wetland habitats. Because of the large scale detailed analysis of the study area, this is possible and the method complements more general satellite surveys. Using ground test classification techniques, the researchers have established a relationship between habitat types and the distribution of eggs and larvae of the salt marsh mosquito. That brings me to the issue of the environment resources information network, which is within the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. This network enables all the data that is available, or can be brought into the aero-system, to be put on a computer system. An extremely important part of this is the satellite data. ERIN uses the US NOAA satellite data, which it receives every two weeks. The data it receives is an aggregate of the twice daily pass-over that is made by the satellite. ERIN takes in this raw data, which is then processed by the CSIRO Division of Oceanography. The data is used as a baseline in environmental monitoring. NOAA, as compared with Spot and Landsat, gives a one-kilometre ground resolution. Landsat has a 70-metre resolution and Spot has a 30-metre resolution. Consequently, although ERIN uses the NOAA system as its preferred system, when high resolution or local detail is necessary, the information is obtained from Spot and Landsat. ERIN provides a picture of the whole continent and is currently setting up a baseline in which Australia's vegetation can be monitored over time. I think we can see the environmental implications of having such a monitoring system. The baseline will be used as a reference to identify changes in the Australian environment. Our vegetation classification system will be incorporated in ERIN, which will be linked to satellite data. This will allow those using ERIN to get comprehensive information. The operators of ERIN are endeavouring to facilitate availability of information for environmental decision making and planning, although one problem is that information out there is not being made available to the system, partly because the information is commercially sensitive and also because some companies are reluctant to provide their information because they do not want it available on a free information basis when they feel they should be able to sell it. ERIN is endeavouring to facilitate the availability of information for all environmental decision making. Once baseline data is available, it will be linked to climatic data so that climatic changes brought about by floods, fire and any other activity can be documented. Once changes or patterns have been documented, environmental scientists will have the information to ask questions about causes and processes. This has just been a very brief touch on the importance of satellite imagery and satellite sensing for the environment. This technology will very much be the future. The information that we get on the environment from satellite imagery will improve our environmental knowledge and the environmental health of Australia.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It heralds a new direction for the space and scientific industries within this country. For the first time in its history, this bill will embody in legislation a coordinated and strategic approach by Australia to its space interests. It will help to set Australia on the right path to participate effectively in space related industries.  The formation of the Australian Space Council has arisen out of a 1991-92 expert panel report entitled An integrated national space program . In summary, the panel recommended the establishment of an integrated national space program with assured funds over five years; the formation of an Australian space council; support for existing space activities in this country; and, particularly, the earth observation and mobile communications sectors to be made a priority for the local space industry. The government's acceptance of the expert panel's findings opens a new era in the gradual development of Australia's space capability and reputation. It provides a common focus and set of directions for the industry by providing the building blocks for a common effort on a strategic plan for Australia's space activities both inside government and in the wider scientific and business community. This bill will add value to Australia's expenditure in space related activity and extend the opportunities for private investment in international markets and in import replacement. It will assist this by providing a strategic focus and integration of effort, which will create a basis for rational cooperation between agencies responsible for public investment and integration with private investment. The balance of the Australian Space Council's membership will be between government, industry and the academia, including CSIRO, ensuring a mix of representative talent. The Australian Space Council will be this nation's flagship for Australian civil space activities. This will be achieved by the preparation of a five-year strategic plan to chart the future objectives and strategies of the national space program. Progress has already been made, with an interim report being due out in the coming months. This bill is a breakthrough for Australia's space and scientific communities. The Australian Space Council has a charter to produce the five-year plan, which highlights the growing support within this government for developing space industries. It is a testimony to the government's vision for Australia's technologically based industries that we are committed to their development. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) talked about the vision of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in the area of space. I imagine that this refers to the article that I noted recently in one of our national dailies that included an appropriate photograph of the Leader of the Opposition. It is quite fascinating to find that suddenly the Leader of the Opposition has a new interest in this area. I will now quote from the Senate Hansard . We will find out whether this newly found vision has anything to do with opposition policy on this matter.

In comparison with the opposition, in this bill we are demonstrating our continuing commitment to policy development and strategic focus. Let us go back to some history. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) made some comments on the history that my colleague the honourable for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) referred to. It might be useful for the honourable member for Gippsland to know that Australia was an international leader in space activities. I remind him that it is a fact that we were the third nation in the world to build and launch our own satellite. This was a remarkable achievement for a small country. We were a major player in the early days of space activities, participating in British and US missile developments and in the European space program, mainly from the Woomera launch site in South Australia. In fact, it was when the British and Europeans lost interest and we had no infrastructure to maintain this important research that our pioneer status as a space nation came crashing down, presumably like some of the missiles that did not get off the ground. While there may be many views on this matter, it is my position that the complacency of the coalition government of the day was a major factor in the run-down of this and other important science based industries in this country. It has been well documented that former Prime Minister Robert Menzies disapproved of Australia's expansion into information technology and related scientific industries. In fact, Australia was a pioneer in computer technology, with the CSIRO having one of the largest computers in the world by 1947. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Menzies, saw no future in computing and Australia's early advantage was abandoned in the 1950s. It is little wonder that the Woomera era came to a sudden end after the British lost interest. Put simply, if the British were no longer interested, Australia was not interested. This has proved a costly decision for the Australian space science, avionics and related research industries. As one of the largest users of current space technology, covering everything from weather prediction to telecommunication development, Australia has to find $300 million annually to import this technology. Regrettably, the coalition has learnt little from this history. As I said, Senator Macdonald has put all science policy on hold for the duration of this parliament. I suspect that, having failed so miserably with a definitive set of policies in Fightback, the opposition has decided to go to the country on nothing. I suspect the result will be that it will continue to be in opposition for a considerable time, being both policyless and leaderless. In other words, from what Senator Ian Macdonald said, the coalition has put Australia's space industry into the too-hard basket. They are unclear and unsure on this, as on many other matters. It is true that Australia's space industry has not been a major recipient of our government's funding in the last 11 years because we have been in the business of restructuring other sectors of the economy.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/para[13]","N/A","N/A"

A total of just over $70 million has been earmarked for space policy development since 1983. This would seem an insignificant sum when compared with a country like Canada which spends between $300 million and $400 million each year. However, what we are about in this bill is clear policy development with regard to space activities.  Following a recommendation of the Madigan report in 1985, the government formed the Australian Space Board to manage the national space program. In 1988, the board reviewed the content of the national space program and from this review the expert panel was devised. The findings of this panel in 1991-92 have laid down the foundations of this bill. With the advent of the Australian Space Council, the legislative and structural framework for space activities will be set. Due to this policy development, Australia's reputation in space science and industry has made significant progress since 1986. It will be as a result of the continuation of this progress and Australia's highly regarded reputation in the space area, if not its resources, that we can base our future in this industry. I want to refer to some comments made by Professor Adrienne Clarke, Chairman of the CSIRO, in a speech titled `Science and society in Australia's future' delivered on 13 July 1993.

Its history is that in 1982 there was a series of dramatic incidents in which airliners flew into clouds of volcanic ash, suffered fairly significant damage and, in a couple of instances, lost power. While there were no crashes, these incidents were very dangerous and could have led to loss of life.  As a result of these incidents in 1982, which involved various airliners from British Airways and Singapore Airlines, the CSIRO began investigating new methods of detecting volcanic ash in the atmosphere. This interest was further rekindled in 1989 when a KLM 747 flew into a volcanic ash cloud near Anchorage, Alaska, sustaining $100 million worth of damage. The Division of Atmospheric Research has recently patented the instrument. It is pleasing to see that the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development has been involved in funding part of this research. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald dated 26 July 1993 indicated the positive testing that had been carried out in Japan but that the problem was then providing the commercialisation phase.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","214","0","Mr PRICE","QI4","(Chifley)","ALP","N/A","664","—A number of my colleagues, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) in his second reading speech, have pointed out that Australia was one of the first countries to take an interest in space and that it was the third country in the world to build and launch its own satellite from its own soil. I thought I should repeat that because I think many Australians would doubt that Australia had the ability not only to build and launch its own satellite but also to be the third country in the world to do so.  Listening to the contribution of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) for a few seconds, I thought that I would end up agreeing with some of his criticisms but, unfortunately, I cannot agree with them. I would like to speculate as to what might have happened if we had only followed through with that initial research. Might it have been the case that the Aussat satellites, for example, would have been manufactured and built in Australia? Australia may very well have been exporting its own Australian-made satellites. We may have had a fully developed program for launching satellites in Australia. Woomera may have been superseded by the North Queensland space launch facility that has been mooted. I can only reflect on opportunities lost. The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) has suggested that part of the reason may very well be as a result of policy decisions made during the Menzies years. She also referred to the CSIRO's activities in relation to computers. Again we were a world leader in the development of computers, but that initial research breakthrough was never translated to an ongoing commitment, was never refined and developed, and was certainly never commercialised. What a tragedy. A very famous memo, allegedly written by Prime Minister Menzies, said that the transistor was not to be pursued in Australia again because it had little future. I suppose we cannot get all maudlin about lost opportunities, but it is a reminder to members of parliament, policy makers and people at large not to underestimate the capabilities of Australian research. In many cases, we are at the leading edge, notwithstanding the fact that, in overall terms, whilst we have a very strong public research sector, a weaker private research sector and a fairly modest aggregate, we are still able to come up with breakthroughs and innovations. That ought to be a source of pride, but I suppose this is where I differ from the honourable member for Goldstein. It is of precious little value to a country in terms of its living standards. It is of precious little value to the researchers themselves when they see these breakthroughs being made but not being fully embraced in a development process or commercialised. I can understand the honourable member for Goldstein saying that many researchers are dissatisfied. I do not think it is an aspect of science policy that is missing here. I sincerely believe that it is an under-commitment to research and development by Australian based firms. Notwithstanding the government's introduction of a then revolutionary scheme of 150 per cent research and development, the amount of money spent on research and development by Australian firms is very small compared with leading edge companies overseas. I believe this is a major problem. I believe that Australian business is capable of responding to this problem, but we must recognise that it is serious. We will not have a happy science environment until all aspects of the process are fully utilised and fully esteemed, and we cannot make that statement today. We cannot substitute public authority or activity or university research for a lack of private research. At the end of the day, we have to build up that private component. I could not agree with the honourable member for Goldstein on that issue. As the honourable member for Capricornia pointed out, if the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has this vision splendid for science policy and believes it is so important, why is the opposition deferring this area of activity until after the next election? I think he is condemned by his own shadow minister for the statement he has made. A number of members have commented that they have been disappointed by the space program. I have to say that I am one of those members. I have had a very profound admiration and respect, which I think I share with many Australians, for the contribution that former Senator Button made to Australian industry policy at aggregate level to Australia. But I cannot stand here and claim to believe that the space policies that he had, while minister, led to a resounding success. Once we have let opportunities go, it is very difficult to try to recreate them. Instead of looking at the market at large, over the last several years we have talked about what so-called niche opportunities are available for the space industry. I agree with the remarks of my good friend the parliamentary secretary about the space council. He said:","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","214","0","Mr PRICE","QI4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I think we would all agree with this; I certainly do. As my old friend Mr David Large, whom I am happy to say I worked with very closely in another life in communications, would know, when we were trying to look at the opportunities that were available to Australia in deregulating the communications market, we developed as a recommendation from the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Telecommunications Reform to the then minister an industry policy that set some ambitious targets. In fact, our exports were then running at about $230 million a year. We developed a policy and suggested that we ought to aim for $2 billion a year by 1996. I have always been confident in developing that target that, rather than being an ambitious one, it would be one that was overshot. But I think there is value in it. I urge the parliamentary secretary to seek from the council an estimate or a target of what this program can produce in exports.  How should we evaluate the program? I support the parliamentary secretary's remarks in his second reading speech but, unless we can translate research into actual commercial products, we may feel very good about the quality of the research and we may have peer esteem in the scientific community for that research but, at the end of the day, a good proportion of it needs to be able to be translated through a development process and commercialised so that it is either replacing imported products or so that we are exporting and, not regrettably, niche marketing to the world at large. We are currently spending nearly $6 million a year on developing a space program. As the honourable member for Capricornia has pointed out, Canada, with an economy roughly twice the size of Australia, is spending something like $300 million a year on its program. I wonder what the return would be if we were to spend $12 million, $18 million, $24 million, $50 million or $100 million. I know there is a lot of pressure on government expenditure, and both the opposition and the government stand up from time to time and say how determined they are to rein in public expenditure, but what would be the returns to the country if we were to increase our expenditure on this project? An expenditure of $6 million per year is modest, and maybe it is the appropriate amount to spend. I would be very pleased if the National Space Council were to report on the matter. I applaud the government for seeking to adopt a five-year plan. One of the most difficult things for departments and authorities in Australia to do is embark on long-term planning. A feature of our neighbours to the north is that they do indulge in long-term planning. I love quoting Indonesia because it plans 25 years ahead in five-year tranches. Unfortunately, in Australia we have made the word `planning' almost a dirty word, particularly long-term planning. Unfortunately, it is a feature of our business community that their eyes are constantly on, at the very most, 12-month cycles and often quarterly cycles; 18-month planning tends to be seriously long-term planning. I congratulate the minister and the government for having the courage to say in this very important and vital area, `Let us look at a five-year plan, make a long-term commitment and see what we can gather'. I spoke a little earlier about the 150 per cent research and development arrangements available in this country that were a breakthrough. Unfortunately, I have to confess that there was a period when we thought of reducing the figure to 125 per cent. I am pleased that it is 150 per cent, but there is no room for complacency. I am a staunch advocate of this plan; I think it is working very well. Singapore has already introduced a 200 per cent R&D scheme for research and development undertaken by private enterprises. If Australia wants to make a dash for growth, if it sees its future with a highly skilled work force, if it sees itself as a nation capable of innovating, a nation at the leading edge of scientific endeavour, such as in the space field, it should not lag behind in the field of industry, with a poor record of research and development, maintaining a scheme that is now already falling behind other countries equally ambitious to our north, where a 200 per cent research and development scheme is in operation. I also congratulate the government on another aspect that the parliamentary secretary has outlined. In five years time the Space Council will not review itself; there will be an independent review of this area of Australian activity, this area of funding by the national government, this—if I may be so bold to say—interventionist industry policy approach by an independent group. I always think that is very useful because, even with the best of intentions, whether we are talking about a space program, a car plant or telecommunications deregulation, we are never always going to get it right. We want to look at the things we did well but also, equally importantly, at what needs fine tuning, and at what changes we should put in place. Science and technology are advancing at a rapid rate. We used to be able to think in terms of 10- and 18-year time spans but that has been reduced these days. We are lucky if we can survive five years without wishing to change. I welcome that aspect of this legislation. Lest my remarks be misinterpreted, I strongly support the introduction of this bill. I certainly feel the government has taken the right approach in regard to the mix of people it has put onto the Space Council. I am delighted to see serving on that council my old friend in harness, Mr Large. I await with interest the advice the council will give to the government in developing its five-year plan. I certainly hope it will optimise the remaining opportunities Australia now has as compared to the earlier rosier ones. I wonder whether the $6 million is sufficient. Is it hitting it on the head or are there greater returns to be had, more export dollars to be had and an even better cost benefit ratio? Should we increase the allocation to the Australian Space Council for a period? Last but not least, I am sure that the parliamentary secretary, as well as the Australian Space Council, will be impressed by the numbers of members both in this House and the other who are taking a keen interest in their activities and who wish them well.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/para[8]","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","215","0","Mr O'CONNOR","WU5","(Corio)","ALP","N/A","667","—I am very pleased to participate in this debate on the Australian Space Council Bill. I am the first to concede that my knowledge of space and space related industries is not all that extensive. When I decided to participate in this debate I did so for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I share the native interest of most honourable members in space related matters. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology I am very interested in the industry and job creation potential of an expansion of this industry in Australia. I believe I also echo the sentiments of members on both sides of the House when I declare a real interest in the development of space related technologies that serve mankind and advance the human condition.  My own fascination with space began in the 1950s as a young man growing up in the western districts of Victoria. We did not have electronic modes of entertainment in those days, and reading comics was a leisurely pastime for many a youth. The themes in those comics fell into three broad categories: detective stories, westerns, and space comics. The space comics, with their careful chronicling of great space battles and space heroes light years from the earth, evoked the mystery and fascination of a world that was far beyond one's normal human experience. That curiosity and fascination with space was fuelled during the 1960s with the prospect of space flight becoming a reality. The launch of the first Russian satellite was an event that propelled human consciousness into another dimension. With the first manned Russian flight in space it became apparent that mankind could reach beyond the stars. All this culminated at the end of the 1960s with the Americans succeeding in putting a man on the moon. It was not only our fascination with the technical possibility of further space travel that grew with these manned space flights; the popular cultures of the day began to reflect that growing awareness of space and the spin-offs, for us mere mortals on the planet earth, from engaging ourselves in this particular quest. As far as literature was concerned, we saw the rise of this science fiction genre. If I took a poll of the people in this House, I am sure that many of us who read a lot at some stage became very much addicted to the Isaac Asimovs of this world and other great writers of the science fiction genre. But it was also the electronic media that caught onto space and we saw the making of those great cult classics. I will mention one of those because I really have to make an admission here today: I am a Trekkie. I regularly watched Star Trek and rapidly became a fan of that particular program. Who can forget Gene Roddenberry, who wrote and produced this particular series, and—his great exhortation in the introduction to that program: `Space, the final frontier to boldly go where no man has gone before'. I guess there is an analogy here for the current government. We have won five elections on the trot and we look forward to going through the 1990s into the year 2000 to boldly go where no Labor government has, perhaps, gone before. Those events in the 1960s confirmed mankind's technological capacity to project itself beyond the home planet earth. They gave an enormous boost to the technological quest to utilise the knowledge gained through space flight to overcome some of the planet's more pressing problems. I guess it is from this latter perspective that Australia's involvement in space matters ought to be actively encouraged. I welcome the initiatives that are contained in this particular bill. Recently, my own interest in this area has been stimulated by some quite separate but personal events. My son recently took an active interest in that old classic of the 1960s, Star Trek , and has become interested in the stars. He has bought himself a telescope and recently brushed off the tripod and is going to engage himself in a bit of stargazing. After this week, when I get back to the electorate, if time permits, I will join him in that. A more interesting event happened to me recently when I was in Melbourne. I needed to use a toilet with some urgency so I parked the car, ducked into a building and sat down to engage myself in some introspective reflection. My eyes moved to a piece of bold graffiti which was etched on the toilet wall. It said, `Beam us up, Scotty, there's no sign of life down here'. It was at that particular point that I was reminded of my own mortality—and I see the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) smiling. When I come to this particular parliament and I gaze at the opposition front bench from time to time, I am reminded of that particular quote, `Beam us up, Scotty, there's no sign of life down here'. I guess my interest in the industry implications of Australia's involvement in the space program was stimulated by an encounter that I had with a young constituent. Many honourable members know that people come through the door, from time to time, with interesting ideas and some of them at the time seem a little crazy. Some months ago a young man dressed very neatly in a suit, a shirt and a tie came to see me. He wanted to talk about space and space related industries. As it is very important to give access to young people and to hear their ideas—and being relatively ignorant of this particular area—I sat down and talked with him. What he said to me was very interesting. The young man had harboured, since his days at school, a longstanding interest in space and the development in Geelong, in the seat of Corio, of a space industry, if you like, or some firms that could spin off the development of a space program. The young man was particularly interested in small payload rockets and low orbital satellites that would perform various functions in our region. He was very knowledgeable about space and he indicated that the big players in the space game—the United States and, to a lesser extent, the Europeans—were mainly concerned with the building of larger payload rockets. He also indicated that there was a real niche in the market for firms to build low-payload rockets. Of course, he was interested in doing so and he had drawn up particular plans that he was keen to put to potential investors. It is those various elements that have really stimulated an ongoing interest that I have had in Australia's space program. I noted with some degree of interest that the honourable member who preceded me in this debate from this side, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), levied some criticism at the former industry minister the former senator John Button about the handling of the space program until his resignation from the parliament. I suppose it is fair to say that more could have been done in this area, as far as stimulating Australia's involvement in the program, given our historical association with space programs. It has already been noted in the second reading speech that Australia was one of the first countries to take an interest in space. We participated with the British and the United States in their missile development programs and then, as the second reading speech notes, in the European space program during the 1960s and the 1970s when using Woomera for rocket launches. It is fair to say that the seeds of the Australian space industry have been historically sown, but governments and private industry have not, perhaps, watered the plants, so to speak. It is an opportune time as we enter the 1990s—and the various uses have become apparent to which space technology can be put and applied here on planet earth—to take a greater degree of interest. As a nation with a considered technological capacity in many fields ranging from engineering, medical research, environmental research to, indeed, space research itself, we ought to be taking a more active interest in this area and we ought to be pouring more resources into it. In the past, Australia has been a major user of space technologies. The Australian Space Council Bill basically sets up the Australian Space Council, which will have the following functions. It will have the function of advising the minister responsible for space matters on those matters relevant to the national space program and, more broadly, on policy concerning Australia's role in space. If we are going to pursue an active involvement in this particular area, not only on a national scale but on an international scale, that sort of expert advice must come to the minister who has responsibility for it. Another function of that particular council is to formulate and update annually a balanced five-year program of national space activities. It is logical and, indeed, it makes good sense to set up a five-year plan for our involvement in this industry. As the honourable member who preceded me in the debate has noted, the economies to our near north are doing this all the time in various areas of economic activity and in specific areas of their own economies. That is a most important and strategic function for this proposed council to undertake. The third major function of the Space Council will be to coordinate and seek the collaboration of stakeholders in the national space program, including the private sector and the states. The Achilles heel of the space program in the past has been not only the lack of action of governments at the national level to involve themselves in this particular industry but also the failure to coordinate the major stakeholders in an Australian space program that has seen us fall behind other countries in this regard. The fourth and final function of that program will be to oversee the implementation of the overall program and five-year plan. It is a worthwhile objective of the Australian government to involve itself more fully in this area of activity. It is also incumbent upon us to ensure that the job creation potential and the other spin-offs from this space involvement are not squandered because of a lack of resources. I recently attended a reception for a Colonel Blahas from NASA held by the Australian-American Parliamentary Friendship Association. It was my first encounter with a person who had been into space and had viewed human affairs from that unique position off the planet. We had very limited time to spend with the gentleman concerned, and I regret that we did not have more time. Two things came out of the address that he made to parliamentarians who were assembled at that luncheon reception. The first point was that involvement in a national space program has an enormous capacity to inspire the youth in the space area and to encourage an awareness of the sorts of sciences and skills that are involved in a deep understanding of the space program. He spoke very encouragingly of his experience in the United States and the great pleasure that his involvement in the program had brought him because of the inspiration the nation's involvement had given to American youth. The second very interesting point was about the technological spin-offs of a space program. He spoke in most enthusiastic terms about the new areas of knowledge that are opened up when a nation becomes involved in this quest. He spoke of the great advances that had been made in the engineering field and the practical applications back here on planet earth for many enterprises that had come from developing and commercialising the technologies in the engineering fields. He spoke in very warm and encouraging terms about the medical research that was being undertaken in deep space and its application to people here on earth. He spoke of the enormous strides that had been achieved in the development of material technologies and the enormous spin-offs for companies here in Australia and elsewhere throughout the world from that involvement. On an issue dear to our hearts, he spoke of the way in which the progression of technologies has enabled us to monitor the fragile and precious environment that we have here on earth. I think there is great potential, even for smaller countries such as Australia, to have an active involvement in this quest for space and to see the commercial spin-offs that result from it, such as quite significant improvements in job creation and, indeed, industry creation as a result of being involved in a national space program. I conclude my remarks with some comments about what I think this quest means to human beings. I think it is summed up, oddly enough, in the words of Gene Rodenberry, or whoever gave the introduction to the Star Trek program, and that is that space really is the final frontier. When human beings engage in the quest for space and all the related activities that go with it, we see a propelling of the human awareness and spirit into another dimension. At the gathering of Australian parliamentarians only a few days ago, Colonel Blahas spoke about his mission on one of the space shuttles and his re-entry back to earth. He spoke not in any great depth but enough to get one excited about the unique perspective that this experience has given him as a human being. I think the human race is at a particular point in its long—some might say short—history where it needs the stimulus of new challenge, where our great scientists, engineers, environmentalists and medical researchers need a challenge that can only be provided by our involvement in something like the space program. I hope that, over time, with the government taking the bit between the teeth and resourcing this program, we might see an increase in the resources that are provided to Australia's national space program.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SPACE COUNCIL BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In particular, I refer to the constructive contributions made by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). I believe that the standard of their contributions reflects their abiding interest in science and technology and the recognition that Australia must have greater participation in developing our applications from our involvement in space technology. I think that is absolutely fundamental.  In my second reading speech I referred to the Madigan report of 1985, which made a number of recommendations, including the establishment a national space policy appropriate for Australia's situation and that the government should take a leading role in facilitating the development of Australia's capabilities. Those were in addition to a number of other recommendations, including the establishment of a statutory organisation. I omitted to say in my second reading speech that it was the then Minister for Science and Technology, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who in 1984 invited the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences to establish a working party to propose a set of national goals for Australia in space, including an appropriate structure to implement those goals. I pay tribute tonight to the honourable member for Lalor for his initiative in bringing together the working party, under the chairmanship of Sir Russell Madigan, that initiated this legislation now going through the parliament. Australia is indebted to the honourable member for Lalor for the work that he did some 10 years ago in this area. A number of speakers touched on many issues affecting the development and application of space related science and technological matters. I mention that there is a trend towards the use of smaller, specialised, earth orbiting satellites for both remote sensing and communications. An interesting paper prepared by Chris Deacon, the Director of Space Communications at the Australian Space Office, refers to the fact that this new generation of small, low cost, low and medium earth orbit systems hold out the enormous promise of personal communications and services to users, not only in well-developed countries but, more pertinently, in lesser developed countries that lack an adequate basic terrestrial infrastructure and also to business users, for example in Australia, who wish to roam within the country with their hand-held portable communications units or, indeed, internationally. He mentions also that the potential in monetary terms of the application of this technology is enormous.

But, with the tremendous jump in technology, small satellites are now seen as an alternative to the traditional large satellites. A number of small, innovative companies—there is one in south-east Queensland—are looking at this particular situation.  Small satellites with payloads ranging from several kilograms to a hundred kilograms are being considered for many different purposes. These small satellites have a number of applications: navigation, mailbox or electronic mail, store and forward data transfer, remote sensing, earth observation and scientific and engineering testing, apart from tactical communications and so forth. These satellites are relatively cheap compared with the large geostationary satellites, which can cost up to $900 million. These small satellites can vary in cost: for example, launch costs of around $A10 million per launch with very low cost facilities at the launch site—of the order of $20 million compared with a major cost for a geostationary large satellite. Australia must become involved in the development of this technology. Many countries are developing or have developed small satellite programs. A lot of interest is being shown, for example, by Canada and by many European countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy and others. In our own region Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Korea and others are showing a lot of interest in this new technology. Indonesia has been a pioneer in the use of communications satellites. It is continuing this interest by exploring the role of small satellites not only for direct broadcast compressed television and digital audio but also for personal communications. This is an important issue and a number of other issues are driving the interest in lower cost access to space: many national space budgets are being re-examined and as a result low cost, small missions are becoming more significant in national space programs, particularly for the Europeans; there is increasing pressure on the remaining operational launch sites; and there is increasing pressure for more cost effective launches, whether from China, French Guyana, Cape Canaveral, the Russian mainland or wherever that may be. I believe that Australia has significant comparative advantages, both geographical and political. The time has never been more favourable for this country to become involved.

It is a bill which is part of the progression of the development of the space industry in Australia.  As the honourable member for Corio said in reporting his conversations with Colonel Blahas of NASA, the young boys and girls of the United States take a great interest in their nation's space program. They are fascinated by maths and science and its application to the space program. They know—they are told at school—that they cannot be astronauts unless they have a good background in science and maths. They can never become astronauts in a space program. For Australians, ensuring that all young Australians have an awareness of the potential of this country to develop our own indigenous space program at very low cost is an ambition that should be pursued by government. The fact is that commercial operators simply do not have the capital base or other wherewithal to develop quickly an indigenous space program. I would suggest that, whatever their intentions may be, despite all the movement towards establishing a heavy lift space base at Cape York and despite all the talk about locating the space base in Papua New Guinea, all of them will find it very difficult to accomplish that without the involvement of a lot of participants—in particular, governments. Once again, I would like to thank those who have contributed to the debate and urge all Australians to adopt a bipartisan approach to the development of our space industry.

This was a 46 per cent increase for workers in the Jakarta region. The amount of $2.70 is a wage rate that government and opposition, big business, banks and most of the economic editors tell us we have to compete with under the euphemism of `free trade'. The religious doctrine goes like this: free traders are in favour of progress, prosperity and peace. Anyone who questions the dogma is reactionary, isolationist, immoral, promotes monopolies and a lazy unionised worker. In truth, it is the ultimate in political correctness. It ignores the fact that, over the last 20 years since this economic fundamentalism became effective, productive jobs have been exported, a lesser number of non-productive service jobs have been created, real wages have fallen, an underclass has developed, social disintegration has accelerated and corporate crime has soared, as has the disparity between the rich and poor.  Australia now ranks the lowest among Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan and the USA in terms of share of national income for the bottom 20 per cent of the population. We also rank with the United States in having the lowest growth in the years 1970 to 1990 and the lowest percentage of the work force in manufacturing jobs—hence the difficulty in finding anything in the supermarket, department or hardware store which is Australian made. Under the `free trade' doctrine of comparative advantage where countries only produce in areas of natural advantage, there will be a limited choice of occupations for our children. Farming and mining employ few, there will be no timber left to cut and not everyone wants to be a waiter or be part of the huge tax avoidance industry. They cannot all work in the unproductive services and financial sectors. Free trade certainly suits multinationals and obscenely paid executives who can locate manufacturing in the lowest labour cost countries with little industrial or environmental law and externalise their costs for future generations to pay. It assumes endless growth and that consumption in the Third World at the levels of the First World can be sustained. Although mainstream economists have propagandised the myth of free trade for years, two highly respected American economists have recently recanted—and no wonder. America, like Australia, has faced an endlessly rising foreign debt, a relentless rise in unemployment, a shrinking middle class, a happy hunting ground for takeover merchants and a merger mania that has inexorably reduced jobs and competition, increased corporate debt and environmental degradation. It is notable that, in spite of the government and the media trumpeting the recent very good economic indicators, they are muted on unemployment and foreign debt because current policy gives no hope for either. In fact, there is every indication that long-term unemployment will continue at high levels, given the continuing job shedding in the name of restructuring and competitiveness. In addition, to whatever extent the economy improves, imports will accelerate and the trade imbalance will deteriorate. While ever credit is uncontrolled, debt will rise. A small economy like Australia's is an irrelevant pawn as billions of speculative international dollars flash around the world. There has to be some reregulation of the economy. According to Dr Ravi Batra, a noted American economist who in major works predicted the economic collapse of communism and the global recession of the 1990s, we need a policy of competitive protectionism which would increase tax revenues, resurrect the manufacturing base, raise real earnings for 80 per cent of the work force, trim inequality, reduce poverty, enhance the growth of productivity, cripple the abuse of monopoly power by big business and revitalise the economy. Competitive protectionism means raising tariffs but not the crude protectionism of the Menzies era. It involves the splitting of the present many large monopolies into competitive units. No single company should be allowed to dominate the domestic market. Foreign investment should be encouraged for new ventures, not for takeovers or land speculation. Tariffs should be imposed on imports to the extent that industrial and environmental laws of the exporting countries subsidise or undercut the conditions in Australia, subject to the removal of unnecessary impediments by our governments to production. Export trade should be minimised by encouraging technology and capital transfers and minimise the heavily subsidised energy wasteful international transport. By locating manufacturing in resource rich countries, global transport can be reduced by 75 per cent with a negligible effect on global output but with massive economic and environmental gains. These are some of the directions that should replace GATT to create a new world economic order.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Ford Australia put the decision down to reduced tariff levels and declining volumes. From August, imports from Japan will fill the Ford market. We should all be worried about this decision because it not only impacts on the 400 workers—and their families—affected but also undermines our industrial capacity and our ability to be a serious industrial nation.  The policy of tariff reductions is supposed to help Australia. I suspect that these reductions would help if every trading country reduced its tariffs. Ford's decision to phase out its Laser and Capri production needs to be seen in its commercial context. The company intends to focus on its profitable core business in the production of Falcon, Fairmont, Fairlane, LTD and Falcon commercial vehicles. The declining volume of Ford sales, whilst still holding a high market share, is a result of an ageing population. Retirees do not buy many consumer durables like cars, and certainly not of the Laser or Capri variety. Our future as an industrial nation able to be more than a farm and a quarry requires policies that develop our industrial capabilities. I understand that Ford Australia has behaved very well in this difficult situation. The President of Ford Australia, Mr John Ogden, has committed the company to work with the unions and employees to help find other work. Ford will provide retraining programs and an out placement service for its employees. The Ford plant has been given six months notice. This is a very decent and civilised approach to industrial relations. Ford Australia deserves credit for the way that it has handled this most unhappy decision. The House should be aware that the government has a labour adjustment scheme for certain industries, including the automotive industry. Money has been contributed to that scheme: in 1991-92 it had $14.6 million, of which 40 per cent went to the passenger motor vehicle industry and in 1992-93 it had $39.9 million, of which 36 per cent went to the passenger motor vehicle industry. An amount of $31 million has been put into the 1993-94 budget. I am pleased to say that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has announced that the government has offered this to the Ford company by way of assistance so that we have this policy in place. Monitoring has shown that three months after completing the labour adjustment packages, 61.4 per cent of participants are in employment or non-DEET funded education and training. Up to 104 weeks assistance is available and this assistance can be taken in the form of wage subsidies to employers who employ a retrenched worker; training courses including English language, as well as vocational training; and relocation assistance to take up work. This sudden decision is a cruel psychological blow to the economy and a very cruel blow to the 400 workers and their families. I personally feel most upset at this turn of events. Let me share with honourable members some of the profile of this work force. A total of 417 workers will be affected: 38 as salary workers, 44 as tradespeople and 335 as non-tradespeople. Like heavy industry all over Australia, migrants are disproportionately represented at the Ford factory. For the record, the ethnic break down is one-third English speaking people, one-third Chinese and the other third is taken up by a combination of Arabic, Vietnamese and others. These people all tend to live locally so the whole area will be suddenly affected by this closure—in my electorate of Lowe and that of the adjoining electorate of Reid. I would like to assure the workers and the unions involved that I am committed to giving whatever useful assistance they may ask of me. Hopefully, the end of the recession and resumption of serious economic growth will mean that this event does not result in any further serious unemployment amongst these workers at Homebush.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that I had not correctly filled out my forms and had not declared my interests properly. What I had done was declare my interest as a shareholder in various companies. Some of those companies have pastoral interests and interests in land. The Prime Minister was intimating that those people who declare such interests by writing themselves in as a member or a shareholder of a company have not declared that they have interests in land.  The fact of the matter is that a person does not have any interest in land if that person is a shareholder in a company. That person is a member of that company and does not have any interest in land any more than a member or a shareholder of the BHP company has an interest in steel, or any more than somebody who is a shareholder in the Mildara company has an interest in the land that Mildara owns or the grapes that it grows, or any more than the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who I know has a minor interest in a diamond mining exploration—and, as I read the paper every day, an increasingly more minor interest—as I have.

He does not have any interests in diamonds unless he owns them in some other way. Obviously, as the Prime Minister simply refused to answer the question that I asked him, he had to produce some other reason for that escape. It is worth while noting that the Prime Minister has an interest in several companies, one being called Pleuron, another called Phalaris—although I do not think the Prime Minister would know phalaris arundinacea from any other form of phalaris. Nevertheless, he has those interests.  When it came to the real estate section of his declaration of interests, he simply said that the real estate that he had an interest in was in Elizabeth Bay. I am sure that none of the pigs that the Prime Minister is going to run in the area of Scone will be down in Elizabeth Bay because the neighbours will be kicking up the sort of stink that some of the neighbours in Parkville, New South Wales are kicking up. When the Prime Minister wants to divert people by attacking us, he really needs to get on to a better footing than that. Those people who have declared their interests as being shareholders in companies, even if those companies own land—rural land or any other sort of land—have made their declarations perfectly correctly. While we are on the subject of the Prime Minister's interests, whilst he today sought to deny that that interest is doing any damage or will do any damage, the fact is that we do not know that yet. I asked him whether, if it looked as though it might do any damage, he would shift that interest to another site. There are plenty of sites in this country that could absorb very beneficially the sort of effluent that this operation may put out. I draw the attention of honourable members to the Environment Protection Authority's submission to the commissioner as late as October and December last year, which was about two years later than the statement made by Mr Greiner which the Prime Minister quoted in the House.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","226","0","Mr CAMPBELL","CF4","(Kalgoorlie)","ALP","N/A","675","—I rise tonight to do something which I did not think I would ever do, that is, to defend the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). It is my view that as a minister for the environment she has left a lot to be desired. Certainly, while she was not as bad as Senator Richardson, on that area we had a lot of disagreements.  However, what I have to say is germane to the Westminster system. While I think it is a very good system it cannot survive without a good opposition, and this it clearly has not had. It also, to a lesser degree, needs an informed press and it is quite obvious that Canberra does not have that either. I go to the program because it was not an initiative of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories; it was an initiative of the cabinet. What the minister was doing was actually an instruction of the cabinet. If it had been a matter of the minister's largess, I would have got nothing because I do not think that anyone—certainly no-one on the opposition side—has been as critical of the minister as I have. My electorate did very well. It is the safest Labor electorate in Western Australia. What the cabinet was looking for at that time was stimulation of the economy. It wanted to stimulate the areas of highest unemployment. This was a very good way of doing it. The scheme was very much appreciated by all backbenchers who had any regard for their electorates. Many honourable members on the opposite side acted in the interests of their electorate, and did very well out of the scheme. Some of this side, conversely, were slothful and did not take advantage of it. I looked to take advantage of the scheme—and was quite effective. One of the areas in my electorate that benefited was Cundinup. It got money to build a hall. It is an area of my electorate where, in a good year, I get 30 per cent of the vote. Voting in that part of the world is a congenital thing—we have not yet bred it out. I sought to support this area, not because the people in it voted for me—clearly they did not—but because it was an area of great need; and there was no other way they would get this money. Across the border is Ravensthorpe in the very safe Liberal seat of O'Connor. The people at Ravensthorpe wanted a community centre and were told by their member that the case was hopeless and they did not have a chance because of the nature of their electorate. They approached me, as Ravensthorpe used to be part of my electorate. I said, `Send me a submission and I will see what I can do'. On the basis of that submission, they got their money; money they would not otherwise have got. Similarly, in my own electorate, Broome benefited greatly from the scheme—not on my representations but on those of Senator Panizza, who took the proposal to the minister and, apparently, did a very good job. The fact is that the government was seeking to stimulate the economy and this was a very good way of doing it. For people to look for fraud or corruption in this, I think, is quite facile. The scheme had many elements of self-protection. There had to be a large component of self-help in the scheme. There were monitoring systems. I have no doubt that it is possible for someone to rort it. Let us say some fraud was involved. It was very small; far less than the fraud involved in the expenditure of most other government moneys. I warrant that fraud in social security far exceeded any fraud in this scheme. Money from this scheme was put very quickly into areas where it was needed. The recipients benefited greatly. The press and the opposition have a responsibility to find one of those recipients that was not deserving. There were schemes that I did not think were deserving. I would not give a brass razoo to the Hellenic gun club. I do not believe in funding ethnic clubs. But the opposition and this party of which I am a member have a mad policy of multiculturalism. No-one can blame the minister for thinking it was entitled to the money. If we are to have a multicultural society we should remember that there are 10 million registered shooters in southern France and southern Italy alone. Greece is a similar country; very big on hunting and shooting. It was a worthwhile scheme in the eyes of the government. Certainly the minister had every right to make that grant. I have seen the scheme touted and degraded by members of the opposition. I think that is opportunistic, and the sort of thing that brings this parliament into disregard.

Unfortunately, most of that tragedy is not of their making. A lot of it occurred in the first instance because of the very high interest regime that was created over a number of years by those on the other side of the House. Secondly, there is a very large commodity downturn. It is not worth producing many of the commodities on the farm. Finally, my region is experiencing a drought of almost unparalleled extent. It is worse than anything experienced in the region for perhaps the last 50 or 60 years.  The financial situations of many people on farms have reached the stage where about 40 per cent of the rural enterprises in my electorate have had negative incomes for the last two of three financial years. Many of them are bleeding a consistent financial death. In the extreme, many of them have gone to the wall financially and into bankruptcy. With the approval of the constituent concerned and his solicitor, I would like to read into the record a letter I received from a solicitor. It has been sent to the federal Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) as an indication of the sort of situation in which many of these enterprises find themselves.

I am a bit of a cook and the other day when I was preparing a meal my eyes were drawn to the label on a tin of Edgells whole peeled tomatoes. Edgells has a processing plant of some size in Tasmania. I was under the impression that all the produce that went through that plant under the name of Edgells was Tasmanian. I have always thought that when I stop at the local supermarket and buy Edgells I am buying Tasmanian products.

Then it lists the ingredients in the tin, the name of the company—listing a New South Wales address—but the final phrase was the one that grabbed me, and that was `Product of United States of America'. There is no doubt that there is within that label a total misconception of what is in the tin. There is nothing wrong with the products of the United States; I am sure I have indulged in some of them from time to time.  The factory in Tasmania does not import tomatoes. Any tomatoes that are canned in Tasmania—I do not think there are any—should have the words `Product of Tasmania' on the can. This situation goes against the whole emphasis of what we are trying to achieve in the state of Tasmania, and that is recognition of our good products on the food line. International companies such as Edgells wish only to have a brand name which they can sell on the international market. They process food in a uniform way, unidentifiable to a particular country, let alone a particular region. In Tasmania, we must have identification of region to gain the recognition that we need as a state and to gain international recognition for our areas. There is a need for farmers to have alternative supplies for the marketplace and we should be identifying each product from each region. For example, McCains sells chips all over Australia—indeed, all over the world. But they are not identified as Tasmanian. In Tasmania we are very particular about our potatoes. We grow a lot of different types of potatoes. People do not ask for potatoes in Tasmania; they ask for a particular type. The types include bismarks, kennebecs, pink eyes, brownells, tasmans, up to dates, pontiacs, sabagos and several other types. The names of different types of potatoes can be identified by cooking styles. Up to dates make the perfect chip and pink eyes bring out the best of the Tasmanian summer. Here is an opportunity for the world to ask for a potato by name, or at least by state or region. That is one of the aims for Tasmania which we must achieve. Likewise with tomatoes: if we can say that these are tomatoes from Tassie and this information appears on the label, it has got to value-add to Tasmania's reputation for quality. Companies should be encouraged to identify with a region; to feel proud of the produce that we harvest in Australia; and if they have to bring something in from overseas to fill a seasonal gap, then that should be identified as a separate product. We must keep on saying that there is nothing as good as an Australian grown product; we should not be scared to say so. I ask everybody to check the labels in their cupboards because they might be surprised at what they find.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","229","0","Mr NEVILLE","KV5","(Hinkler)","NP","N/A","678","—I rise tonight to record a tribute to one of the great personalities of the cinema and hospitality industries, and who made a contribution not only to his chosen calling overseas but also in northern Australia. I refer to Eric Snelling, who was born in Norwich in 1909 and died in Darwin last December, at the age of 84. His wife Theo predeceased him in Bundaberg in 1977—and a son Peter in 1967.  Eric Snelling entered the hospitality industry, managing the Carlton Cinema at Norwich in the 1930s. It was as a result of his abilities in the mid-1930s that he was asked to open one of the Channel Islands leading entertainment centres, the Regal Cinema on the island of Guernsey. This, of course, was the most inauspicious time to be coming into the industry with the outbreak of World War II looming. Guernsey was not merely subjected to the hardships of war but to the rigours of occupation by German forces. It was a time of positive danger made all the more so by the fact that Eric Snelling, ever one for keeping the spirits of the community up, built an illegal radio which he wired to the disconnected powerlines in his house as aerials. His projectionist—also equally dangerously—actively made up wireless sets for the other residents of Guernsey. With the supply of British and American films drying up, he kept the morale of the islanders up with reviews and repertory in his own and another theatre. He had good reason to encourage his fellow citizens, who were near starvation by the end of the war. He himself lived on boiled seaweed and potato peels. After these rigours he managed the Hotel Le Chene, which is still popularly known to Guernsey tourists. The early 1950s brought him to Queensland, where he took up pineapple farming at Yeppoon. However, the call of the hospitality industry was far too great and he became the assistant manager of the then fledgling Hayman Island. He returned to Rockhampton and managed the Criterion Hotel, one of that city's great landmarks, before joining the Queensland cinema organisation Birch, Carroll and Coyle and taking over that company's Wintergarden and Earls Court cinemas. I was state secretary of the Arts Council of Australia at that time and I frequently used these establishments for the Australian Ballet, J. C. Williamson's and the Elizabethan Trust Opera Company. I can attest to his great management skills and promotional abilities, to say nothing of his personal charm. This period saw a golden age in cinema, with Terry Jackman of Birch, Carroll and Coyle opening a chain of theatres from Lismore to Darwin of capital-city standards and bringing a very high standard of entertainment to provincial cities. Eric Snelling was at the forefront of that movement and adapted very well when Rockhampton's first twin cinema opened. He managed it for some years before moving to Darwin and saw that city's first major cinema open. In fact, he and his wife rode out cyclone Tracy in the Darwin cinema. This building was one of the few not massively damaged by the cyclone and it provided entertainment for the rebuilding workers who had that horrendous task of getting Darwin up and going again. Many times these people were admitted to the cinema without charge. In 1976, he returned to Elliott Heads, near Bundaberg. Following the death of his wife, again the call of the cinema and the hospitality industry became too great and he returned to Darwin and managed cinemas and camera shops until he finally retired at the age of 78. He is survived by his son Brian, four grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and a brother, Cyril. His ashes will be interred in Rockhampton with those of his wife and his son. Eric Snelling was a man of great affability and great charm. He was brought up in that very rigorous school of English cinema and adapted well to the Australian experience. He lived a very full life and to think that he was active in his chosen calling for nearly 60 years says something about him. I pay tribute to him tonight.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[7]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On Monday night he made a casual reference to the demise of Woomera, and it has created considerable consternation in that town. Senator Ray's flippant attitude was an offence to that community, which has already been hard hit by the government's commercial support program.  He commented that he thought the Nurrungar base would not last forever and he doubted whether it would be there at the end of the century. Senator Ray's irresponsible statements have angered and upset the people of Woomera. While Senator Ray may be casual about the Nurrungar base, the people living in Woomera are dependent on it for their livelihood and would prefer that the minister did not discard its future so casually. Senator Ray's predictions stand in stark contrast to advice from US Space Command. According to US Space Command, there is no decision to phase out the facility by the year 2000—or, in fact, by any year. A decision of the US budgetary process two months ago which could have reduced the need for an Australian base was axed. With the benefit of the demise of the Cold War, I understand the existing technology will go so much further. The comment by the Minister for Defence—we could put it in military terms and say `Defence minister deserts Woomera'—follows on from comments by ministers like Senator Schacht, who is very long on rhetoric and short on content, as to the future of Woomera. The people at Woomera are still coming to terms with the commercial support program. Literally hundreds of people have moved out of that community as a result of the loss of jobs for many of the contractors. To have a headline in the Adelaide Advertiser today based on a careless, casual statement by the minister is totally unacceptable. When the minister makes these sorts of comments, I ask him to show far greater respect for smaller communities such as this throughout regional Australia. He dismissed the future of 1,000 people just with the wave of a hand, with a casual comment in the Senate. As I said, these people do not need that sort of pressure, having just come out of a very difficult time with the commercial support program. Woomera seemed to be the flavour of the House today. I note that the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) talked about Woomera. She mentioned that a previous Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, was to blame for Australia not being ahead in computers and also for not being up on the business of space technology because he did not like it. It is nearly 30 years since the man stood in the old Parliament House; today we stand in the replacement House. The honourable member for Capricornia blamed Sir Robert Menzies for the fact that we do not have a space industry today. It was remarkable stuff. Then she said that, because the British were not interested, Sir Robert Menzies was not interested.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[8]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","235","0","Ms WORTH","8V5","(Adelaide)","LP","N/A","680","—I would like to tell this House how government red tape and bureaucracy is touching the lives of seriously troubled youths in my electorate. I urge the ministers responsible for health and community services to take immediate action. It is an issue affecting some of the most marginalised and disadvantaged people in our community.  We all remember the shame and embarrassment we felt when Human Rights Commissioner Brian Burdekin told us in graphic detail how we treated our mentally ill—the squalid living conditions and filthy boarding houses, the lack of support services; that when we tipped these people out of institutions, nobody really cared whether or not many had the backup care needed to cope in the real world. The saddest images were those of our youth, young people who had fallen through the cracks in society, young people struggling to cope with schizophrenia, personality disorders or the consequences of childhood sexual or physical abuse, and young and sometimes violent and antisocial youths with problems like self-mutilation or drug and alcohol addiction—all outward manifestations of internal troubles. Once these children would have ended up in our psychiatric institutions, but now many of them end up on our streets. In my electorate, St Stephens Lutheran Church has run a youth shelter called St Stephens House for the past nine years. For many youths, it is the end of the line. No other government shelter or agency wants them, and they have nowhere else to go. But once they get to St Stephens, whether from a psychiatric institution or off our streets, it offers them medium- to long-term accommodation with up to four other similar young people. Trained staff are on duty 24 hours a day, and counselling and support services are available. Following treatment, 60 per cent of residents will develop independent living skills and go on to play a useful role in society. In less than two weeks, St Stephens will close. Last year, the then state Labor government restructured its supported accommodation assistance program. The places funded for shelters which housed youths displaying challenging behaviours were incorporated into five regional centres around Adelaide. These shelters now deal collectively with youths seeking short-term and long-term accommodation. Sadly, there is no room for St Stephens and the services it offers, despite the ringing endorsement that Brian Burdekin gave the shelter after visiting it last November. He says that there is a real need for shelters like St Stephens for our mentally ill children—and here we are, closing them down. The nearest shelter, other than those offering emergency accommodation, is 30 minutes drive away. As it can no longer be funded under its previous program, St Stephens now seeks funding under national mental health projects grants. This program has around $4 million to distribute over the next few months as part of a federal government commitment to the national mental health strategy. Brian Burdekin is a referee for St Stephens's application. Today, with the 28 February closure deadline looming for St Stephens, my office contacted the Department of Human Services and Health to see how the applications were going. My office was told that everything was up to the minister's office and that a bunch of red tape stopped any quick decisions to save this centre. It will be a further two weeks before St Stephens knows whether it will be funded. That could be too late. By then, St Stephens, now running on the last funds raised by parishioners of the St Stephens Lutheran Church, because government funds have run out, will be closed. St Stephens is costly to run because of the intensive nature of its in-house and outreach services. It needs around $250,000 a year to operate. When one looks at the cost of institutionalising these young people in psychiatric care or, worse, gaols, St Stephens looks very reasonable and cost effective. Not only does it save money in the long term but it also prevents a tragic and unnecessary waste of our young lives. It was the tragic waste that led Brian Burdekin to comment on our treatment of the mentally ill, which he claims breaches international standards. I have presented this House with a petition containing 294 signatures from supporters of St Stephens, urging that the federal government intervene. Prior to the federal election, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) spent large sums of money in my electorate, which was then a marginal Labor seat. Surely now the federal ministers for health and community services can find the money to keep St Stephens open when the lives and rehabilitation of mentally ill and disturbed youths are at stake.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[9]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the commencement of each Parliament 2 Members shall be appointed by the House, one to be Deputy Speaker and the other to be Second Deputy Speaker. The Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker shall be appointed in the following manner: ( a )The Speaker shall ask for nominations and call Members in turn to move, without notice, a motion that a Member be appointed a Deputy Speaker of this House, each motion to be seconded. ( b )When there are no further motions the Speaker shall say that the time for motions has expired. ( c )If there is only one nomination the Speaker shall, without question put, declare the Member named to have been appointed Deputy Speaker. The position of Second Deputy Speaker shall remain vacant until the commencement of the next Parliament, a vacancy occurs in the office of Deputy Speaker necessitating a ballot for the position, or the House agrees to a motion that a ballot be conducted for the position of Second Deputy Speaker, whichever occurs first. ( d )If there are 2 or more nominations, when the time for motions has expired, debate may ensue but it shall be relevant to the election. ( e )No Member may speak for more than 5 minutes. ( f )At any time during the debate, a motion without notice may be moved by a Minister, and whether any Member is addressing the Chair or not, 'That the question be now put', which question shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. Upon the carrying of the question 'That the question be now put', or upon the cessation of the debate otherwise, the appointment of the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker shall be proceeded with as provided in this standing order. ( g )At the conclusion of the debate the bells shall be rung as in a division and the House shall proceed to a ballot. Each Member, other than the Speaker, shall deliver to the Clerk a ballot paper, in writing, containing the name of the nominated Member for whom he or she votes to be appointed the Deputy Speaker. The votes shall be counted by the Clerks at the Table and the Member who has the greatest number of votes shall be the Deputy Speaker and the Member who has the next greatest number of votes shall be the Second Deputy Speaker. ( h )If, after any ballot, other than a ballot which takes place in accordance with paragraph ( i ) of this standing order, in which the names of only 2 Members are submitted, there is an equality of votes, the Speaker shall give a casting vote and the Member for whom the Speaker votes shall be the Deputy Speaker and the other Member shall be the Second Deputy Speaker. ( i )If, after any ballot in which the names of more than 2 Members are submitted, it is impossible by reason of an equality of votes to determine which Member has the greatest number of votes or which Member has the second greatest number of votes— (1)If there is an equality of votes for 2 Members, the Speaker shall give a casting vote for one of those 2 Members who shall then be declared appointed to the office which the equality of votes had made it impossible to determine; and (2)If there is an equality of votes for more than 2 Members, a special ballot shall take place in which only the names of the Members who received an equal number of votes are submitted. If the equality of votes had made it impossible to determine the Member to be appointed as Deputy Speaker, then the ballot shall be conducted in the same manner as provided in paragraph ( g ) and the Member who receives the greatest number of votes shall be the Deputy Speaker and the Member who receives the next greatest number of votes shall be the Second Deputy Speaker. If the equality of votes had made it impossible to determine only the position of the Second Deputy Speaker, then each Member shall write on the ballot paper the name of the Member for whom he or she votes to be appointed Second Deputy Speaker and the Member receiving the greatest number of votes shall be the Second Deputy Speaker. If, by reason of a continued equality of votes, the special ballot is inconclusive, then, unless a name is withdrawn, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes. When the sitting is resumed, the votes shall be taken again unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. ( j )At any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of any subsequent ballot, a Member whose name was submitted in the first ballot may withdraw his or her name and all further proceedings shall take place as if a motion for the appointment of the Member as a Deputy Speaker had not been moved. Duty of Deputy Speaker 13A. The Deputy Speaker shall chair the Main Committee. Duty of Second Deputy Speaker 13B. The Second Deputy Speaker shall assist the Deputy Speaker and, in the absence of the Deputy Speaker, shall act as Deputy Speaker. Absence of Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker Absence of Speaker 14. Whenever the House is informed by the Clerk of the absence of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, or if the Deputy Speaker is also absent the Second Deputy Speaker, shall, subject to any other order of the House, perform the duties of the Speaker, as Acting Speaker, during that absence. Absence of Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker 15. Whenever the House is informed by the Clerk of the absence of the Speaker and both the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker, the Members present, if a quorum, may at once proceed to elect one of their number who shall, subject to any other order of the House, perform the duties of the Speaker during that absence. Otherwise the House stands adjourned to the next sitting day. For the purposes of this standing order, the Clerk shall act as Chair of the House until a Member is elected to perform the duties of the Speaker. Speaker relieved by Deputy Speaker or Second Deputy Speaker 17. The Deputy Speaker or the Second Deputy Speaker shall take the Chair whenever requested to do so by the Speaker during a sitting of the House, without any formal communication to the House. Speaker's panel 18. The Speaker shall nominate at the commencement of every Parliament a panel of not less than 4 Members to assist the Chair pursuant to standing order 19, and may, at any time during the Parliament, nominate additional Members or revoke the nomination of any Member. Duties of Speaker's panel 19. The Speaker or the Deputy Speaker may call on any one of the members of the Speaker's panel to take the Chair as Deputy Speaker. The Deputy Speaker may also call on any one of the members of the Speaker's panel to take the Chair of the Main Committee. (2)After standing order 22 insert the following new standing orders: Vacancies in both offices of Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker 22A. If the offices of Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker become vacant at the same time the House shall appoint 2 Members to be Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker in the same manner as set out in standing order 13. Single vacancy in office of Deputy Speaker or Second Deputy Speaker 22B. When a single vacancy occurs in the office of Deputy Speaker or the office of Second Deputy Speaker the House shall appoint a Member to fill the vacant office in the following manner: ( a )A motion shall be moved, without notice, that a Member be appointed Deputy Speaker or Second Deputy Speaker, as the case may be, of this House, which motion shall be seconded. In the case of appointment to the office of Second Deputy Speaker, only a non-government Member may be named in the motion. ( b )The Speaker shall then ask if there is any further motion, and if there is not, shall say that the time for motions has expired. No Member may then address the House or move any motion for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office, and the Speaker shall, without question put, declare the Member named in the motion, to have been appointed to the vacant office. ( c )If more than one motion for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office is moved and seconded, the Speaker shall, after the second motion, and after each subsequent motion (if any), ask if there is any further motion, and if there is not, shall say that the time for motions has expired. ( d )When the time for motions has expired, debate may ensue, but it shall be relevant to the election. ( e )No Member may speak for more than 5 minutes. ( f )At any time during the debate, a motion without notice may be moved by a Minister rising in his or her place, and whether any Member is addressing the Chair or not, 'That the question be now put', which question shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. Upon the carrying of the question 'That the question be now put', or upon the cessation of the debate otherwise, the appointment of the Member to fill the vacant office shall be proceeded with as provided in this standing order. ( g )Before the House proceeds to a ballot the bells shall be rung as in a division. ( h )When only 2 motions for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office are moved and seconded, each Member, other than the Speaker, shall deliver to the Clerk a ballot paper in writing, containing the name of the Member named in one or other of the motions for whom he or she votes, and the votes shall be counted by the Clerks at the Table; and the Member who has the greater number of votes shall be appointed to the vacant office. ( i )When more than 2 motions for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office are moved and seconded, the votes shall be taken in the same manner, and the Member who has the greatest number of votes shall be appointed to the vacant office, provided he or she has also a majority of the votes of the Members present; but if no Member has such majority, the name of the Member having the smallest number of votes shall be excluded from subsequent ballots, and a fresh ballot shall take place; and this shall be done as often as necessary until one Member has such majority when he or she shall be appointed to the vacant office. ( j )If, after any ballot, other than a ballot which takes place in accordance with paragraph ( k ) of this standing order, in which the names of only 2 Members are submitted, there is an equality of votes, the Speaker shall give a casting vote and the Member for whom he or she votes shall be appointed to the vacant office. ( k )If, after any ballot in which the names of more than 2 Members are submitted, it is impossible by reason of an equality of votes to determine which name shall be excluded from subsequent ballots— (1)If there is an equality of votes for 2 Members, the Speaker shall give a casting vote and the name of the Member for whom he or she does not vote shall be excluded from subsequent ballots; and (2)If there is an equality of votes for more than 2 Members, a special ballot shall take place at which there shall be submitted only the names of those Members who have received equal votes and in which each Member shall write on the ballot paper only the names of the Members he or she wishes to retain. The name of the Member who receives the smallest number of votes shall be excluded from subsequent ballots. If, by reason of a continued equality of votes, the special ballot is inconclusive, then, unless a name is withdrawn, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes. When the sitting is resumed, the votes shall be taken again unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. ( l )At any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of any subsequent ballot, a Member whose name was submitted in the first ballot may withdraw his or her name and all further proceedings shall take place as if a motion for the appointment of the Member had not been moved. ( m )Whenever a withdrawal leaves only one Member in respect of whom a motion for appointment to the vacant office is before the House, that Member shall be declared to have been appointed. (3)Standing order 28B (general purpose standing committees): At the end of paragraph ( c ) add: 'Provided further that, for the purpose of consideration of a bill referred to a committee pursuant to standing order 217A, one or more members of the committee may be replaced by other Members nominated in accordance with the provisions set out in this paragraph. The provisions for the committee to be supplemented by up to 3 members are not affected by this proviso.' (4)New standing order 28BA be inserted: Consideration of bills by House members of joint committees 28BA. The House of Representatives members of a joint committee shall be considered to be a committee for the purpose of considering bills referred by the House under standing order 217A and shall operate under the provisions applying to general purpose standing committees. (5)Standing order 91 be amended to read: Time limits 91. The maximum period for which a Member may speak on any subject indicated in this standing order, and the maximum period for any debate, shall not, unless otherwise ordered, exceed the period specified opposite to that subject in the following schedule: —————————————————————————————————————-","N/A","NOTICES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/proctext/para[16]","N/A","N/A"

(9) Is the Minister able to say whether the Queensland Government has approved the establishment of a repository exclusively for radioactive waste generated in the State; if so, is the Minister further able to say (a) what environmental guidelines and other regulatory requirements apply to the repository, (b) where the site will be located, (c) what is the physical nature of the site and (d) how he has adjusted the Government's strategy for a national repository in response to the proposed Queensland facility. (10) Is a single national facility preferable to a number of discrete facilities; if so, why. (11) Did the Minister's predecessor state in a press release on 7 October 1992 that the Government's strategy would result in the establishment of a single repository. (12) Does the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Act 1992 require the removal of CSIRO waste from the Lucas Heights laboratories by 5 February 1995; if so, (a) how will the requirement be met and (b) which sites are being considered for storing the waste.

"0","1","0","0","0","1","0","3","0","689","0","Mr Beddall","QE4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","(1) A report summarising and responding to public comment on the first phase of the Commonwealth's site selection study for a national repository for Australia's low level and short-lived intermediate level radioactive wastes has been published. The report entitled `National Radioactive Waste Repository Site Section Study Phase 1: A report on Public Comment,' August 1993, is available from my Department. The second phase of the study has commenced which reapplies site selection criteria, taking account of public comment, to identify broad areas of Australia likely to contain suitable repository sites.  (2) Refer to (1) above. In addition to the systematic search for a national nearsurface repository site the Government is inviting expressions of interest from communities interested in hosting a repository. These are regarded as confidential until a firm proposal is elicited from a volunteer community. Firm proposals for volunteered sites would then be considered publicly to assess their technical suitability. (3) Refer to (1) above. (4) The estimated total volume of radioactive wastes stored by the States and Territories is provided in the Commonwealth's discussion paper `A Radioactive Waste Repository for Australia: Methods for Choosing the Right Site' released in October 1992. The Commonwealth is further refining the national inventory of radioactive waste in cooperation with the States and Territories. Details of individual State and Territory inventories may be obtained from the relevant State and Territory government agencies. (5) State and Territory governments are responsible for overseeing the management of radioactive wastes produced within their jurisdictions. Current arrangements are considered to be safe but not ideal. Disposal in a purpose built facility is preferable to current interim storage arrangements at over 50 sites in Australia. (6) Refer to (5) above. The Commonwealth has issued codes of practice prepared by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) which are available for adoption by the States and Territories. States/Territories have developed legislation and regulations covering the management of radioactive wastes generated within their jurisdiction. Details are available from relevant State/Territory government agencies. (7) It is proposed that radioactive wastes generated by the States and Territories which are suitable for near-surface disposal under the Code of Practice for the Near-surface Disposal of Radioactive Waste in Australia (1992) be disposed of at the national repository. (8) The estimated volume and types of radioactive waste stored by the Commonwealth is provided in the Commonwealth's discussion paper `A Radioactive Waste Repository for Australia: Methods for Choosing the Right Site' released in October 1992. (9) I understand the Queensland Government is proposing to establish a facility at Esk for interim storage of radioactive wastes generated by users in Queensland pending disposal in a national radioactive waste repository. Responsibility for siting, construction and operation of this facility rests entirely with the Queensland Government. (10) The small volume of low level and short-lived intermediate level radioactive waste generated in Australia suggests that no more than one or two near-surface disposal facilities are required. (11) The press release issued by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon Simon Crean, MP, stated that the site selection study would identify a suitable site for a national radioactive waste repository. (12) Subsection 4 (3) of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Amendment Act 1992 allows orders made on 5 February 1992 by the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales concerning removal of CSIRO waste from Lucas Heights Research Laboratories to have effect on and after 5 February 1995. (a) and (b) The question of how those orders will be satisfied is under consideration. (13) (a) The national near-surface radioactive waste repository will be managed in accordance with the Code of Practice for the Near-surface Disposal of Radioactive Waste in Australia (1992) (b) Radioactive wastes will be transported to the facility in accordance with the Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances (1990). Application of State/Territory regulations to the repository will be a matter for discussion with the Government of the host State/Territory. (14) Half lives of low-level and short-lived intermediate level radioactive wastes range from several years to thousands of years. The Code of Practice for the Nearsurface Disposal of Radioactive Waste in Australia (1992) sets stringent concentration limits for near-surface disposal of long-lived radionuclides.","N/A","Radioactive Waste Repository Site","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[1]/answer/para[1]","N/A","N/A"
