I understand that the usual custom is to call a member of the Government party and then a member of the Opposition. Perhaps, owing to the way in which the seats of members of various parties are distributed, you, sir, frequently call two Government supporters in succession, but I do not regard that as a proper procedure. In view of the fact that, during the term of the Bruce-Page Government, all supporters of that composite Ministry sat on one side of the House, do you not consider that you would be able to make a fairer allocation of the call if all the members of the Country party sat on the Government side, seeing that a number of seats are empty on that side of the chamber?

The House was then informed of the method of giving the call, which followed precisely that adopted in the last Parliament, and I believe also in other parliaments. The call is given to the right and left of the Chair alternately, but, insofar as there are two parties supporting the Government side, and a number of members of one of those parties sit on the left of the Chair, it becomes necessary to allocate the call as fairly as possible, having regard to the distribution of parties in the House. I have carried out that practice. The present question may be prompted because I recently gave the call to the honorable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), immediately following the honorable member for Hume (Mr. Collins), both of whom belong to the same party but sit on opposite sides of the House. At question time, the Chair does not necessarily give the call in turn to the respective parties, because I think it would be unfair to call one member several times when another member has not been called at all. In the case to which I have referred, the honorable member for Forrest had not risen previously. The honorable member for Flinders (Mr. Fairbairn), who rose at the same time, had previously received the call, and, therefore, I gave it to another member on my right, namely, the honorable member for Forrest. The question as to the seating arrangements was raised privately by the honorable member for Hunter (Mr. James), who wished me to instruct all members of the Country party to sit on my right, but I said that I was not prepared to give such an instruction. Apparently the party to which the honorable member for Hunter belongs has ample room. I suggested to the honorable member for Richmond (Mr. R. Green) that, because of the representations made by the honorable member for Hunter, he might, perhaps, move to another bench, so as to make a whole group of seats available to the Australian Labour Party, New South Wales group. In my opinion, the seating accommodation of that party is ample, and I can see no good reason for crowding the benches on the ministerial side.

An export control board was first appointed in 1926. The present board consists of a member nominated by the Government, a representative of the processing firms, and one elected by the co-operative bodies and canners. Although Tasmania has not received a fair deal from the board which has been in existence during recent years, I have no objection to an exports control board. In 1930 the then Misuser for Markets (Mr. Parker Moloney) had an interview with the chairman of the board concerning an accumulation of canned peaches in Great Britain, and had the existing conditions altered so that Tasmania could market apricots without having to have peaches to sell with them. It was arranged that for every five cases of apricots marketed in Great Britain two cases of peaches should also be disposed of. That arrangement- was detrimental to Tasmanian producers who did not have any peaches to market, and consequently could not dispose of their apricots until the close of the season, when prices had dropped considerably. I hope that in future the Government or the board will see that the produce of certain  States is not disposed of to the detriment of that of other States. I realize that the Assistant Minister (Mr. Hunter) wishes the business of marketing canned fruits to be placed on a more satisfactory basis. In 1931-32 the quantity of canned fruits exported from Australia totalled 35,348,740 lb., valued at £641,527. In 1932-33 shipments totalling 39,152,500 lb., and valued at £722,597, were disposed of, and in 1933 they totalled 59,770,778 lb., and were valued at £949,206. The board has done good work, particularly when we realize that while other primary products have been selling at a loss the price of canned fruits is fairly well stabilized. As this industry is one in which a large number of persons is employed it should be given every assistance. There are vast areas of land in Australia suitable for the production of different varieties of fruit, and I am sure that the products which Australian fruit-growers are placing on the market compare more than favorably with those of other countries. I commend the Government for including fruit salads in this bill. I offer no objection to the appointment of a secretary, but as the fruit-growers have only one representative on the board, the Government appointing one member, and the proprietary firms another, I presume that the secretary will not have a vote.

I know that it is a fetish of private enterprise that there must be no governmental control of any industry, but a number of Australian industries got into so much difficulty that they had to ask the Government for assistance. In 1924 those engaged in the industry were in such a difficulty that they had to ask for legislation to control the marketing of dried fruits in Austrialia and overseas. The Governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia realized that it was essential to enact legislation to regulate the trade in dried fruits, including currants, sultanas, and lexias, produced within their boundaries; but as the State authorities had not the power to determine the quantity of these products to be sold overseas, and could control only the marketing operations within their own borders, the Commonwealth Government was asked to pass legislation to cover interstate trade and to appoint a Dried Fruits Export Control Board. This system was found so successful that about two years ago the State Governments introduced more comprehensive legislation, thus providing a further mea sure of State socialism, in order to assist this important primary industry.

I point out, however, that the original act, which this 'bill is designed to amend, has caused considerable heart-burning. I agree that the dairying industry should be stabilized; but in the attempt to stabilize it, hardship has been caused to large numbers of small dairy-farmers. It is true that the producers of dairy produce, as a whole, accepted the scheme of control; but only those who produced at least 500 lb. of butter a year were entitled to vote in order to decide whether or not the scheme should be put in to operation. In his second-reading speech the Assistant Minister (Mr. Hunter) quoted figures showing a number of producers who voted for the legislation being made operative, and those who were opposed to it. As he pointed out, of the persons, entitled to vote a large proportion favoured a system of control; but those dairy-farmers who produced less than 500 lb. of dairy produce a year, although affected by the decision, had no say in the matter. I realize that this Parliament must take the long view, and deal with Australia as a whole; but, at the same time, it is not right that the small producers should be disregarded. In his address to a recent conference of Commonwealth and State representatives regarding agricultural and marketing matters generally, the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) laid down four important principles, the first, and probably the most important, of which was that means should be adopted to make it possible for Australia to speak with one voice on agricultural and marketing matters. That principle is sound. Nevertheless, I point out that in 1932-33 small dairy-farmers in Tasmania, who individually made less than 500 lb. of butter, sold 2,593,000 lb. of butter, comparedwith 8,470,000 lb. produced in the butter fac to ries of that State. It will readily be seen, from those figures, that the producers of about one-fourth of the butter made in Tasmania that year were denied a share in the control of the industry in which they were engaged. These small producers of butter are placed at a considerable disadvantage, inasmuch as they have to pay the levy imposed by this legislation before they receive any return for the butter they sell. That is wrong in principle, and efforts should be made to remedy the anomaly. They have to buy the wrappers for their butter before they can offer it for sale. That means the outlay of ready money, which many of them can ill afford to pay, particularly when, as is often the case, they find it difficult, if not impossible, to pass the levy on to the consumers. I know of many instances in which small dairy-farmers hare received only 6d. per lb. for their butter, out of which they have to pay 3d. per lb. levy. Efforts should be made to remove this hardship. As I have said, I have no serious objection to the bill, because I agree with the Acting Prime Minister that Australia should speak with one voice on agricultural and marketing matters. Only in that way shall we obtain a fair return for our produce. I think, however, that all producers should have a voice in the management of the industry in which they are engaged. Tasmania produces a fair proportion of the to tal butter made in Australia. Last year, out of an Australian to tal of 452,000,000 lb. it produced 11,500,000 lb. In 1932-33, its proportion of a to tal butter production of 419.000,000 lb. was 11,071,000 lb. In 1931-32, when the production of butter in Australia generally was considerably less, the to tal being 390,000,000 lb., the ratio was practically the same, for of that quantity Tasmania produced 9,462,000 lb. I submit that the small dairy-farmers, who, in Tasmania, make about one-fourth of that State's butter, should have some share in the control of the industry. I hope that the Minister will take these representations in to consideration with a view to removing some of the hardships which the small producers of dairy produce now suffer.

Certain unscrupulous butter dealers and factory proprietors, more particularly in Victoria, are buying dairy butter from small producers of less than 10 lb. a week, and who are, therefore, not called upon to pay the levy, and are blending it with factory butter and selling it at the declared price or slightly less. If these small quantities of dairy butter are being used for blending in bulk, the levy should undoubtedly be paid upon them; otherwise the fund is being deprived of money that should justly flow into it. The fact that the levy is not paid on such butter reduces, to a small extent, the price paid to dairy farmers generally for butter fat. I ask the Minister to take steps to prevent the undesirable and unscrupulous practice to which I am now calling his attention.

It is gratifying to me that such an overwhelming majority of the dairymen of Australia voted in favour of the continuance of this legislation. The figures were : For, 50,747; against, 1,416. A good deal of opposition was offered to the control of the dairying industry when it was first mooted. In 1924, while the Commonwealth Parliament was sitting in Melbourne, a deputation from the Australian Dairy Council waited upon the then Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) and requested that legislation should be introduced for the control of the dairying industry, but the government of the day decided that it was not expedient to accede to the request. The dairymen of Australia, however, became insistent, and improved their organization to such an extent that the time came when the Government could no longer resist their representations. It was proved beyond question some years ago that the dairy-farmers were the hardest worked and most poorly paid section of the primary producers of Australia. In the large closer settlement areas of Queensland, the dairymen are still having a particularly lean time, notwithstanding that the marketing of their products is controlled, both interstate and overseas, in consequence of this legislation and supplementary legislation passed by the parliaments of the three eastern States. It is unfortunate that the export price of butter is so low. The dairying industry has expanded phenomenally in Queensland. The dairymen are to be complimented upon having established such a wonderful organization. Their fight against vested interests has been more or less successful. Those interested in the success of the proprietary factories of Australia did their best to prevent the enactment of this legislation originally, and also to defeat the efforts to obtain an affirmative vote for its continuance; but they failed to achieve their object. What has been done for the dried fruits and dairying industry by controlled methods could also be done with advantage for the wheat industry. The wheat merchants, of course, are determined to fight strenuously against government control of the industry, but I hope that it will not be long before an Australian wheat pool will be established, somewhat on the lines adopted for the marketing of our dried fruits and dairy produce.

The Opposition genuinely welcomes the introduction of this bill, and will do nothing to obstruct its speedy passage through the House. This is, however, an opportune moment to reiterate the resentment we feel at the harsh effect that the sections of the act now to be repealed have had on many worthy citizens of Australia. The enactment of this bill will remove one of the blackest pages from the history of the pensions legislation of the Common wealth. By enforcing these particular sections of the act the Lyons Government has unjustly penalized one of the most thrifty classes of the community. Many persons who had given an honorable example of the best characteristics of good citizenship were called upon to suffer through what had come to be known as the property sections of our pensions law. I believe that the Government was prompted to introduce these objectionable provisions by certain impertinent suggestions made by the Auditor-General who, in my opinion, grossly exceeded the scope of his duties, when he took it upon himself to propose that certain lines of public policy should be followed.

The comments of the Auditor-General, probably, misled the Government into introducing the objectionable provisions of our pensions law which are now to be repealed; but. during the time these have been in operation they have imposed cruel hardship on many pensioners. The Acting Treasurer (Mr. Casey) in his speech in introducing this bill said that the Government had administered these sections of the act with generosity and liberality; but, in my opinion, they could not possibly have been administered in such a way, for they cut right across every cation of generosity and liberality. The Acting Treasurer, in the course of his speech, revealed to us the real true intention of the Government in introducing these provisions, for he said that they were designed to act as a deterrent, to people who,' though technically entitled to an invalid or old-age pension, were not quite in need of either.

Without doubt, the introduction of these sections into our pensions law cruelly intimidated many aged and infirm people to such an extent that they either surrendered their pensions, or did not apply for pensions to which they were justly entitled. The former Attorney-General, Mr. Latham, intimated in the course of one speech that he made on this subject, that 12,000 persons had surrendered their pensions, and that it was estimated that another 13,000, who were eligible for a pension, refrained from applying for it. In that way 25,000 persons were deprived, or deprived themselves, of this social benefit because of the intimidatory and unfair methods adopted by the Government in the application of this law. It worked very unjustly upon two sections - those who for various causes surrendered their pensions, and those who were beneficiaries under the wills of pensioners who died after the passing of the act of 1932.  The Acting Treasurer referred to people who were in a . position to maintain themselves without pensions. But many in the first section were sufferers. There were those who, having surrendered their pensions, were obliged to provide themselves with the ordinary necessities of life by increasing the mortgages upon their property. During the two years in which these property sections were operated, these people, in addition to the hardships they were forced to suffer, have sacrificed over £100 each through the surrender of their pensions. Sons and daughters having contributed towards the acquirement of property for the parents, but having no legal documents by which they could subsequently prove any degree of ownership, many parents, with a view to safeguarding the rights of their children to the property, were prepared to forgo the right to the pension. Members of the Labour party have earnestly entreated invalid and old-age pensioners to refuse to forgo this right. I am glad now that public opinion, and here I pay special tribute to the work of the pensioners' associations, combined with the efforts made by members of this party to have this unjust position rectified, has at last forced the Government to abolish these iniquitous provisions.

Our efforts must have had some effect on the Government.  I have said that the second section of pensioners most seriously affected by this provision are the beneficiaries under the wills of owners of property who died during the currency of this law. The department, no doubt, has made claims on the estates of these people and has had its claims satisfied. But the result has been to deprive of their rights persons who might have been beneficiaries under wills. The effect of amending this measure will be that beneficiaries under the wills of pen- . sioners who died since the 31st December, 1932, will now be placed in a different position from those who, under this measure, will be enabled to share in estates of pensioners who die after this bill becomes law. I contend that this measure should apply retrospectively, and I understand, that an amendment to bring about that result will be proposed in committee. I hope that the Government will be prepared to accept that amendment so that the entire provisions of the measure will be made more equitable. I regret that Ministers have not .Been fit to remove every irritating section of this nature introduced into the act in 1932. Particularly do I draw the. attention of the Acting Treasurer to section 17 fi, which deals with the maintenance of pensioners by their relatives.

Its removal would enable a fairer interpretation to be given to the purpose of this legislation as a whole.  There are many other .anomalies in this legislation arising out of the provisions introduced in 1935. I realize that, under this particular amending bill, a wide review of the pensions law is not proposed. However, I feel that a point raised by the honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan), dealing with the harshness of renews by medical .officers on the claims for invalid pensions, should receive serious consideration; and .on that point I should like the Minister to give the House a satisfactory explanation when discussing this measure. These reviews are not nearly as just or sympathetic as they .might be. It seems to me that in this respect some very vital change has been adopted.; medical officers appear to have the idea that the law must not be applied with sympathy and consideration. Numerous complaints concerning the unfair treatment of applications in medical examinations have been brought under my notice, and I hope that the Government will liberalize the law in that direction and instruct medical officers that they must be .prepared to review cases with due sympathy -and consideration. I genuinely welcome the bill, and I again express regret that, under earlier legislation, this Government imposed such unfair conditions upon invalid and old age pensioners and members of their families /by the enactment of provisions relating to claims upon pensioners' property. The injustice of that legislation was felt .severely in many homes. It is, therefore, gratifying to know that the Government is repealing those sections in the act. It is a pity that it did not go further, and make the provisions of this bill retrospective so that we could entirely remove from the- statute-book the record of legislation which is a hideous memory to so many people in Chis country. The objectionable provisions relating to claims on pensioners' assets had the effect of placing the property of pensioners in pawn, so to speak, and of converting what, under our social legislation was a right, into a loan repayable at the pensioner's death. I am glad that this injustice is being removed from pensioners. I am glad that at last they are to get that justic which has been too long withheld from them.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","140","JENNINGS, John","KK7","Watson","N/A","N/A","287","I congratulate the Government upon bringing down this legislation. The repeal of those provisions in the act relating to claims on. property will give much needed relief to a large number of pensioners, and remove anxiety and unrest that have existed for some time in many homes throughout the Commonwealth. While I admit that the honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) is fully entitled to claim for himself and members of his party, credit for having forced the Government, as he puts it, to introduce this legislation, may I point out that the step the Government has taken is the result, primarily, of strong representations made by many members on this side of the House. Realizing the heartburnings which the property provisions of the law, inserted in the act a few years ago, caused in many homes of pensioners, we placed the facts before the Government. The administration of those provisions led to the disclosure that, unknown to members of their families, many pensioners had claimed and were in receipt of pensions. This caused a certain amount of embarrassment in quite a number of homes.  The Acting Treasurer (Mr. Casey), in his speech on the second reading admitted that the amount received under the children's contributions provisions of the act. was infinitesimal and that the cost of collecting the additional revenue was actually in excess of the sum received. The one fact that emerges from the operation of this legislation covering children's contributions is that, the sons and daughters of Australian citizens have done all that could be expected of them in times of adversity. The manner in which, during lean years, they have loyally helped their aged parents is ari effective answer to oversea critics who are prone to regard the average Australian citizen as a person without sentiment or a sense of filial responsibility. Tn regard to the operation of the property provisions of the law, an unfair burden has been imposed upon a section of our people - with thrift penalized - and it is gratifying to know that they are now being removed from the act. Every one will admit that, in the great, majority of cases, pensioners with property acquired their homes as the result of much sacrifice, and often with the help of their children. Therefore, as I stated in the last Parliament, they should be left in undisturbed enjoyment of them. Moreover, home ownership is by far the best safeguard against the spread of communism in a. community, and it is an asset to the Commonwealth. This is an additional reason why no unfair burden should be placed upon those who, by thrift and sacrifice, have acquired a home. They are not so likely to be led away by ill-advised political propaganda of irresponsible people. Because I hold these views X. welcome the introduction nf this bill. An important point to be considered in connexion with our invalid and old age pensions legislation is that the. passing of this bill will result in a substantial increase in the amount required for the payment of pensions, and so it must be viewed in the interests of both taxpayer and pensioner. It is estimated that, for the present, financial year, the pensions bill will be £12,000,000, and vh tit next year the sum will be larger, lt, is. therefore, obvious that Parliament must face the position. If, as seems; likely, the amount increases to £13,000,000, it. will absorb, not only the whole of the £8,000,000 received from the sales tax, but also nearly one-half of the income tax collection. The possibility of the introduction of a national insurance scheme has been discussed in this Parliament on' other occasions. It would now seem that if future governments are not to escape a certain amount of embarrassment, due to the increasing claims on account of pensions and other social legislation, the position will have to be faced in the future. The consideration of this important aspect should be removed from the atmosphere of party politics in order that some .suitable scheme may be adopted to finance our pensions obligations. My suggestion is that a non-party parliamentary committee be appointed to make a thorough investigation of the problem, and place before the Government its recommendations to finance an approved scheme. In view of the fact that our pensions and other social legislation absorb nearly 20 per cent, of the total Commonwealth revenue, the need for action along the lines indicated must, I think, be obvious to most honorable members. In our own party we have had an invalid and old-age pensions committee to consider and advise the party with respect to difficulties and anomalies arising out of our pensions law, and I suggest that the same functions could be discharged with satisfaction to all parties in this House by a committee constituted in the manner indicated. In the meantime, 1 fully endorse the proposals contained in the bill, and believe that it will have the approval of the majority of the people throughout the Commonwealth.

On that occasion, he said that it was only fair that, upon the death of a pensioner, the Government should recover from the realization of pensioners' property some portion at least of the amount which had been paid. That was his view then. I know, because I was at a meeting of pensioners in Hurstville where they had the honorable member for Barton on the carpet. I have no doubt that the strength of this organization began to dawn upon him, because, shortly afterwards, he and other Government supporters, including the honorable member for Watson (Mr. Jennings), took advantage of every opportunity to snipe at the Government over its administration of the pensions law. Their view of the fairness of the property provisions entirely changed when they understood the strength of the Pensioners Association. I say, therefore, that this bill torepeal those sections in the act is the direct result of an agitation by that body, and if it is now supported by Government members, it is not because of their sympathy with the old-age pensioners, but because they consider that their own miserable political hides are in jeopardy.

The questionnaire sent out to relatives contained all kinds of intimate questions and caused so much hostility that the Government, on the eve of the election, proposed to repeal the section under which it was issued. Under this bill provision is now made to achieve that object. But the Government deserves to be criticized over this matter, because it is again prepared to put up a stalking horse, as it did when it brought down, on the eve of the last election, a bill to validate the suspension of section 5.2.m. During the debate that took place following certain criticism levelled against the Government, the present Minister for Defence (Mr. Parkhill) was running round to see how it could be called off.

I desire now to deal with section 17 fb, which provides that no person shall receive an old-age pension unless his relatives, namely, husband, wife, father, mother, or children, do not, either severally or collectively, adequately maintain him. If consideration is being given to the unfairness of any section of the act, surely that section is unfair! I have dealt with specific cases in the House showing how harshly it operates. The Minister, during his second-reading speech, referred to the fact that liberal allowances were made in the case of relatives who were asked to contribute under section 52m. He said that exemptions were granted in respect of a married couple up to £312 per annum, with an additional £50 for each child, and a further allowance for the education of children. But no such liberality is extended under section 17 fb, as I shall show. A man at Greta has an invalid son 28 years of age. The total income into the home is £5 a week. He has three other children, none of whom were working at the time, apart from the invalid child. This man has been told that the son is adequately maintained, and that a pension cannot be granted.

The purpose of this bill is to provide funds to complete the programme of financial assistance to the wheat industry in respect of the 1934-35 season. The major provision for relief to wheat farmers is contained in the 'Wheat Bounty Act 1934, and the Wheat Growers Relief Act (No. 2) 1934, which were passed in December, 1934, following upon the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry. The royal commission advised that immediate assistance should be given in respect of the 1934-35 harvest, and that an amount of £4,000,000 should be made available for disbursement in the following manner : - A bounty of 3d. a bushel on the marketable wheat delivered for sale. Advances to be made to the States to an amount of £1,926,750 for the purpose of enabling them to make payment of approximately 3s. an acre on wheat. The balance of the £4,000,000 to be made available for the assistance of farmers who suffered special hardship in respect of the 1934-35 harvest. The Wheat Bounty Act 1934, provides for the payment of a bounty of 3d. a bushel on wheat sold or delivered for sale from the 1934-35 harvest. It is anticipated that the expenditure under that act will be £1,500,000. The Wheat Growers Relief Act (No. 2) 1934, provides for the payment of grants to the States of such amounts as are necessary to enable the States to make payments to wheat-growers at the rate of 3s. for each acre sown with wheat for grain during the year 1934. It is anticipated . that the expenditure under that act will be not less than £1,926,750.

The reason why the legislation passed in December did not embrace the full amount was that some doubt then existed as to the proper manner in which the distribution should be made. The royal commission had indicated in its report that the matter would be further investigated with a view to ascertaining the needs of the farmers in the different States, and that a supplementary recommendation would be made at a later date. That recommendation is contained in the special report that I tabled this morning, and the Government is taking this, the first opportunity, to introduce legislation to complete the distribution of the £4,000,000.  The royal commission advises that the most recent data obtained indicates that the amount which will remain for the relief of cases of special adversity out of the total of £4,000,000 to he provided by the Commonwealth Government will be approximately £573,250, and recommends that it be distributed amongst the States as follows : - The reports of the royal commission refer briefly to the nature of the adverse conditions experienced in each State, and advise that the allocation recommended has not been determined by the application of a rigid formula but rather as a result of the careful weighing of the conditions existing in the several States. The commission has expressed the view that the application of a hard and fast rule would not have achieved an equitable distribution between the States, having regard to the numerous causes of special adversity which must be fully recognized and provided for in any scheme of allocation. The Government is very anxious that those farmers who have suffered severely from the adverse conditions referred to by the commission shall be granted special assistance at the earliest possible date, and accordingly has brought down this bill immediately upon receipt of its report. There is no occasion for me to repeat what I said in regard to the condition of the wheat industry when introducing the previous legislation. This bill is to be regarded as one which brings to completion the measures decided upon by the Government for financial assistance to wheat-growers in respect of last season. It prescribes the amounts that are to be granted to the several States in accordance with the recommendation of the commission and specifies that the amount granted to each State shall be applied by it in providing relief to wheat-growers who satisfy the prescribed authority that they have suffered serious loss and hardship by reason of either specially adverse seasonal conditions or extensive damage to their crops arising from the prevalence of pests or disease.

If the Government refuses to grant the relief asked for, it will support the suggestion that, in bringing down the amendments embodied in this bill, it has merely been seeking to catch votes, and has not been actuated by any real desire to afford relief. Unless the Government acts on its own initiative it will be necessary for us to move amendments in the committee stage of the bill to section 17, and also to sections 22 and 23. The Government, should not stand idly by and allow hardships to be inflicted upon the needy. That is a brutal and cowardly attitude to adopt.

Under that se c tion a pension may be refused to a man who has c ommitted some offen c e, and served a term of imprisonment for it. When a man is found guilty in a c ourt and senten c ed to imprisonment, we must assume that the judge or magistrate has imposed upon him a punishment whi c h is adequate to meet his offen c e, so that the Pensions Department has no right to infli c t further punishment upon him. I know of two men who have served terms of imprisonment, and others who, on a c c ount of drunkenness, have had their pensions stopped.  Section 25d of the act states that the property of a married couple is deemed to belong to both. Under that section considerable hardship is sometimes inflicted upon married persons who do not live together. I know one respectable old man who had worked very hard, and had accumulated a considerable amount of property which he had put in his wife's name. Then they quarrelled, and he left the home. When he applied for a pension it. was refused him, because the value of his wife's property was more than £800, and no separation order had been obtained. If both parties sign a form provided for the purpose, the pension may be granted, but though I got the old man to sign it, his wife refused. When I approached her she said, 'Let the old fellow go hang; I will not assist him.' She was living very comfortably, but her husband was living in a tent, and suffering considerable hardship. This section has been in the act a long time, too long in fact, and steps should be taken to amend it. Consideration should also be given by the Government to the manner in which the Pensions Department assesses income.

I think I have made it clear, however, that those same honorable members supported the legislation which inflicted the hardships in the first place. I am proud of the clean fight which has been waged by the pensioners' organization, which even went into the camps of the 'United Australia party, and, by means of circulars, asked its members to explain their actions. The amendments now proposed are due entirely to that organization, and not to any sympathy shown by politicians. Whilst it may be said of the pensioners that many of their comrades died before it was decided that the obnoxious sections should be repealed, those who have carried on this fight must be glad to know that at last the Government has given in, as a result of the representations of their organization. But other amendments of the act are required, and I feel sure that the pensioners will keep their organization intact, in order to carry on the fight.

From the inception of the Premiers plan, my party has opposed, tooth and nail, all legislation that imposed reductions of wages and social services, particularly in regard to invalid and old-age pensions.

Ever since the introduction of the property sections in 1932' the subject of eld-age pensions has been a plaything in the game of party politics. I notice that even to-day there is an earnest desire to say that Codlin, not Short, is the true friend of the pensioners. The scheme regarding the property of pensioners has proved a failure.  It was unfair to the best sections of the workers, it discouraged, thrift, and it never accomplished anything of substantial advantage. I believe that there will be general relief at its abandonment. For my part, I have opposed it ever since its introduction, and I shall have a good deal of satisfaction when it is finally erased from the statute-book. It has been suggested that further amending clauses should be brought down with reference to invalid pensions, and I agree that there might well be. more relaxation, in some instances, of the conditions under which invalid pensions are granted. This could be carried out without further amendment of the law, merely by more sympathetic administration and a general direction to government medical officers, who are really the arbiters in these cases. On their reports, decisions Are reached as to whether or not these pensions shall be granted. From the first, the phrase ' permanent incapacity for work ' has been taken to mean, entire permanent incapacity. I have never considered that interpretation to be quite justified. . The hardships of the pensioners have been unduly accentuated by reason of the conditions imposed during the last few years. There are many borderline cases in which the applicants cannot be regarded as unfit for any work. They might be able to do some light work if such were offering; but, in these times, opportunities for light work are so small that a person who is subject to a substantial incapacity is unable to compete with sounder men in the race for employment. It would he a wholesome thing for the Government to issue a general direction to medical officers to have regard to existing conditions, considering not only whether the applicant would be able to do light work if it were offering, but also whether he had a reasonable chance of earning his living under present circumstances. In many cases, applicants for pensions have no chance of obtaining jobs, and refusal of the pension in these instances causes great hardship. Discretion should be exercised, as to the amount of the pension in such cases. There should not always be merely a choice between the maximum pension and no pension at all. Even half the pension would be of great assistance to many who are in distress. This improvement, I think, could be accomplished by sympathetic administration, and I respectfully suggest to the Government that it should intimate to medical officers that they should have regard to existing conditions, and not be too severe in their interpretation of the words ' permanent incapacity for work '.

I am glad that the Government has at last realized that those sections of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act with which this amending bill deals can no longer be administered successfully. I realize that its action in this respect is due, not to a change of heart or to the Government now being more sympathetic towards the invalid and old age pensioners than it has been previously, but solely to the fact that it is uneconomical to endeavour to collect money from this source. It has decided to discontinue this policy solely because it does not pay. Those provisions which were regarded by the Government as having a deterrent effect upon potential pensioners did not operate as it thought they would. The most extraordinary statement which I have ever heard in this House was that of the Acting Treasurer (Mr. Casey) who said that those sections to which honorable members on this side so strenuously objected were inserted to cover persons who, although technically entitled to a pension, were not actually in need of it. After all, what does that mean? The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act provides in the most specific and definite terms the conditions under which persons are entitled to receive an invalid or old-age pension. These provisions relate more' particularly to the possession of an income or of property whereby persons can live without the assistance of an invalid or old-age pension. Invalids must produce a certificate of a medical practitioner to prove that they are totally incapacitated, and persons claiming an old-age pension must prove that they have reached a certain age and are not in receipt of any income. They have to satisfy the department that they are entitled to a pension. I am surprised that the Acting Treasurer should have referred to persons ' technically entitled ' to a pension.

Humanitarian considerations do not come into the matter at all; it is merely a matter of pounds, shillings and pence. I am proud of the fact that when this subject first arose I voted against the attack which the Government made upon the aged and the sick.  I also direct the attention of the Minister to the anomaly which exists in connexion with the granting of pensions. Under the present system the department has the right to determine the date on which a pension, when granted, shall be payable. If a pensioner lodges an application, say, on the 1st December, and it is granted perhaps a month later, he should receive it from the date on which the application was made. The department should not have discretionary power in the matter.

Sir LITTLETON GROOM (Darling Down) [2.54]. - I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this measure, in which provision is made to delete from the act those sections which relate to the property of pensioners, and the collection of money from the relatives of certain pensioners. When these provisions were embodied in the principal act the financial position was most unsatisfactory, and the Government took the view that it was compelled to adopt measures to conserve the revenue. There was no lack of sympathy with the old-age pensioners, but a sense of public duty, and we must give the Government credit for its intentions in taking action in the public interest. Now that conditions have changed, the Government is to be congratulated upon having introduced amendments which will place the old-age pension system practically where it was when the Lyons Government assumed office. I am glad that we have again established that the pension is the right of those who receive it. J. cannot agree with those who altogether condemn the present system, in their desire for the introduction of an entirely new system.. It is well that we should call to mind the difficulties which had to be overcome before legislation authorizing the payment of pensions was first placed on the statute-book. Those difficulties were so great that at that time a pensions act seemed a long way off, but, fortunately, the Government of the day was able to devise a scheme which made possible the establishment of a general system of pensions throughout the Commonwealth at a date earlier than was thought feasible. At that time it was the only practicable scheme for granting invalid and old-age pensions. That legislation has roved to be a boon and a blessing toundreds of thousands of Australians, including some who were opposed to the system when it was first contemplated. The Government is acting wisely in introducing these amendments, because some of the legislation which they seek to amend has operated harshly. Sections 17 and 22 placed a prohibition upon the grant of pensions to persons who had, within five years preceding the date of their claims transferred property of any kind exceeding £100 in value, other than bona fide for value. Those provisions operated harshly in the case of individuals' who, in good faith, made gifts which, when made, were not thought to affect their pension in any way. That prohibition is now to be repealed. Section 52a also goes out, and the result will be a cessation of tho3* irritating inquiries relating to the real property of pensioners and their relatives. Even if a pensioner acquires property exceeding the value of £400 after having received a pension, he will not, if this legislation is passed, be called upon to repay to the Government the amount of pension paid to him to the extent to which the value of the property exceeds £400. Henceforth pensioners will be able to deal with their own lands without having to notify the registrar, and, in default, being subject to certain penalties. Section 52e also goes out and in future, the Crown will not forward claims and ask for the repayment of pensions from the proceeds of estates of deceased pensioners.

Claims upon the relatives of pensioners, which, to its credit, the Government has not enforced for some time, are also to disappear. When that legislation was introduced I pointed out that it would not be effective, as the experience in Victoria in connexion with similar provisions proved. I objected to it on principle, not because of the amount involved. A pension is a grant to the pensioner, and has nothing to do with the actions of his children. It is the right of every old person that because of the part he has played as a citizen of his country he should be relieved of adversity in his old age. It was wrong to put an applicant for a pension in the position that,, because of his application, his children might have to face a number of actions in the police court to compel them to contribute to his upkeep. That provision has gone for ever, and the pension is now established as the right of the pensioner; there I hope it will remain. An old-age pension is a grant by a grateful community to men and women who, in earlier life, did their part in helping to build up the Australian nation, and who in their declining years have found themselves in adversity.  The figures quoted during th is debate show clearly that on the whole Australians are prepared to do their duty by their parents. That also is the experience of most honorable members who have dealt with applications for old-age pensions'. The Acting Treasurer (Mr. Casey) said that as a result of an inquiry into the property possessed by old-age pensioners, it was found that of 177,000 pensioners, 70 per cent, had no estate at all from which the Commonwealth debt could be recovered. Those persons were clearly entitled to a pension. The inquiry revealed that of the remaining 30 per cent., 11 per cent, owned their own homes, but no other property. That indicates the thrift of many of those who, late in life, were forced to accept ass is tance from the Commonwealth. The average net unencumbered value of their homes is £285. About 5 per cent, of pensioners own other property besides their homes, the average value of such property being ' £62. The balance of 14 per cent, do not own homes, but own other property of an average value of £49. The very interesting analys is to which I have referred does a good deal to remove m is understandings, and to demonstrate that the pension system is really benefiting the people whom it is intended to benefit. Most pensioners have no property at all. Others with property of very limited value should be allowed to transmit it to relatives upon their decease. General sat is faction will be felt throughout the Commonwealth at the action which the Government is now taking. It is credit able to the Government that it should bewilling to amend what may have been in some respect an error of judgment in the introduction of these prov is ions - I am sure that there was no hardness of heart. I congratulate the Government upon the introducon of the bill, and I shall certainly support the measure.

On behalf of the pensionersof my own electorate, and pensioners generally, I offer hearty thanks to the Government for the measure of reform which is being effected, and I attach no tag to my thanks. My attitude on this subject has been consistent. I have always believed that it was economically wrong and inhuman to introduce these provisions. The Government will yet discover that the policy of expanding the spending power of the people, includingour invalid and old-age pensioners, will be the wisest one to adopt to rectify our economic troubles.  I should like, however, to direct the attention of the Acting Treasurer (Mr. Casey) to two pension, anomalies which may appropriately be discussed under this bill, and in respect of which some remedy is desirable. It has been ruled that, according to a strict interpretation of the law, a person who has what iscalled a reversionary interest in an estateis not entitled to a pension, although hemay be eligible in every other respect. In many cases pensioners with these reversionary interests are drawing nothing whatever from the estates concerned, and, because of their age. and the conditionsattached to the winding-up of the estate, it is highly unlikely that they will ever receive any personal benefit. In these circumstances, it is quite unfair that they should be deprived of a pension. The Acting Treasurer has intimated that, with the law as it stands, no other ruling can be given. If this is so, it would be fair and proper to amend the law to allow such persons to obtain the pension. If, subsequently their reversionary interest La the estate concerned yielded them an income, the pension position could he reviewed.

In some cases, because, it may be, of departmental delays, but in other cases because of soma accidental remissness by a police officer or a shire council clerk, it takes anything from three to nine months to secure the restoration of such pensions on the return of the people to Australia. I know a pensioner who went abroad under the circumstances which I have related, who is nearly £100 out of pocket because of delays in the restoration of his pension on his return to Australia.

I trust that something can be done to remedy the injustice under which that pensioner is suffering.  It is highly desirable also that a definite decision shall be made as to the conditions governing the first payment of pensions. At present a person who applies for a pension may not get it for months, though ultimately it may bc granted on the exact grounds of the original application. In such cases the pension is payable only as from the fortnight preceding the date of notification of the granting of it. .That seems to me to be unfair. If a pensioner's application is found to be sound, I submit that the pension should be payable from the date of the application. If that cannot be done, at least there should be some definite provision covering the period during which the application hangs fire. I trust that the day is not far distant when the Government will see its way clear to restore the pension to £1 a week. I know that provisions have now been made to adjust pensions according to fluctuations in the cost of living; but it would be gratifying to everybody if the Government could restore the pension to £1 a week, the figure at which it formerly stood. I do not want to stint my thanks to the Government for having introduced this bill; nor do I suggest that it has been done for purposes of political expediency or any other unworthy motive. The passage of the bill will be a great relief to many pensioners who are now subjected to a good deal of mental worry because of the fear that the home in which they and their families may have lived for 40 or 50 years and which, in their opinion, really belongs to their children, may ultimately pass to other hands. These homes, in many oases, are worth not more than £200 or £300; but a good deal of family sentiment attaches to them, and many old people regard with great distress of spirit the thought that the property may ultimately pass into the hands of strangers. These were the views expressed by many to me when I asked them not to give up their pensions because of the provisions which this bill wipes out. I say, in all seriousness, that, as a result of that legislation, many old people have died a year or two sooner ' than they would otherwise have done. It certainly will be a great relief to the old people of this country to learn that the Government has removed these obnoxious clauses. I congratulate the Government in bringing this measure forward, and I hope the day is not far distant when it will go further and at least restore the invalid and old-age pensions to £1 a week, the rate at which they stood before the cut was made.

I remind honorable members opposite, some of them particularly, that a Liberal government was responsible for the introduction of invalid and old-age pensions in Australia. Pensioners owe all that they have received in this direction to Liberal and Nationalist governments. The system was inaugurated by a Liberal government, the rate of pension then being fixed at 10s. a week. Subsequently, by two alterations, this amount was increased by a Nationalist government to 15s. Then. I think, a Labour government came into power, and, on the eve of a general election, the pension was again increased. The Minister for Health (Mr. Hughes) and Mr. Higgs were responsible for this rise, and they are both now anti-Labour.

The honorable member referred to national insurance. When, the Lyons Government first came into power it took up that matter seriously and appointed a committee to inquire and report whether it was possible to inaugurate a scheme of national insurance, particularly against unemployment. I was a member of that committee. We met on many occasions and, finally, were forced to the conclusion that such, a scheme could not be gone on with at the time in view of the financial depression not only in Australia, but throughout the world. National insurance, we decided, could be proceeded with only after the world financial position had improved. It was considered that one of the biggest difficulties in connexion with such a scheme would be to make reasonable provision for men out of work, since with so many thousands of men unemployed in this country this would involve the expenditure of a very large amount weekly. Under those circumstances it was thought wiser to delay action along those lines. Social services in Australia, including pensions, cost over £23,000,000 annually, or one-third of the Government's total revenue of from £57,000,000 to £60,000,000.

In the dismal atmosphere surrounding this retreat, it was remarkable to hear the humorous suggestion made by the Acting Treasurer (Mr. Casey) that this piece of legislation is a further evidence of the Government's policy of liberalizing pension legislation. As a matter of fact, the Government is only giving back piecemeal something which it took from the pensioners. If the Minister calls that a liberalizing process, he is stretching the King's English a little too far. A second humorous statement made by the Acting Treasurer was to the effect that it had been the intention of the Government to bring down this particular legislation prior to last Christmas, but that owing to pressure of government business at that time, its attempt to amend the Invalid and Old Age Pensions Act along these lines had to be abandoned. I do not think anybody outside a lunatic asylum would take that statement seriously. The real reason why the Government withdrew the measure introduced at the time was that it was presented in such a form as to permit of certain further amendments being moved and the Opposition took advantage of the position and moved for the restoration of the pension to fi a week. This the Government did not desire, and believing discretion the better part of valour, it abandoned the bill and accomplished by regulation, instead of by legislation, what it. now proposes to do. It is interesting to recall statements made in 1932 by the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) and the then Attorney-General (Mr. Latham), when the amendments of the act, which this bill wipes out, were introduced. The Prime Minister pointed on that occasion to the huge burden of pension commitments, and said the Government had found it necessary to discover some way of easing that burden. He claimed that there were a large number of well-to-do people in the community who, regardless of their own responsibilities to their parents, were prepared to allow the latter to draw the pension'. He claimed that that legislation would be of considerable assistance to the Government in meeting the pensions bill. But what do we find? At that time the pensions bill was £10,500,000 a year, and in the two years during which the sections relating to the claims on property were in operation, the assessments made amounted to £6,698, while the actual amount received by the Government was only £2,4SC. I invite honorable members to image the distress tha t was caused to pensioners and their relatives, and the extent to which pensioners and their relatives were harassed, and to consider the enormous cost of sending out circulars requiring pensioners to furnish particulars of the assistance received from relatives, and measure it all against the paltry amount received.  The Minister was rather ill-advised in dealing with the effect of this law upon pensioners owning property, because what lie had to say really exposed the absolute futility of the insertion of those provisions in the act. The Prime Minister said at the time that the Government would be able to recover an enormous sum of money from the estates of deceased pensioners. Let us examine the position and see how much the Government could have obtained even if it had collected the full amount claimed. According to the Acting Treasurer, the particulars relating to 177,000 pensioners showed that 70 per cent, of them had nothing at all in the shape of property against which the Government could make a claim at their death. Pensioners who owned their own homes but no other property constituted 11 per cent, of the total, and the average value of their homes was £285. A single pensioner gets £45 10s. a year, so if his home was of the average value, namely, £285, his pension payments would, within seven years, be equal to the amount of his equity in his property. The pension payable to a man and his wife is £91 a year, and if their home was of the average value, their equity in it would be lost to them within three years. The Government would then own it. If these provisions had been enforced from the date of the passing of the bill in 1932 a single pensioner owning a home of the average value would lose it in 1938 and married pensioners, assuming their home was of the average value, would lose their equity in it in 1935. If this is not confiscation I should like the Acting Treasurer to explain what it is.

But the object of the 1932 legislation was to recover in this way all payments made to a pensioner between December, 1932, and the date of his death.  The Minister also referred to another section of the pensioners, namely, those who owned both a home and other property. The figures revealed that the average value of other property was £62. Assuming that the property provisions of the law had been enforced, a pensioner and his wife owning other property of the average value stated would lose it in nine months. The figures also show that 14 per cent, of the pensioners possess other property but do not own their own homes, and that the average value of this property is £49. In the case of a single pensioner this would go to the Government in twelve months, and in the case of a pensioner and his wife it would be lost to them within six months. In 1932, when we were protesting against the Government's proposals, we urged that if the property provisions were enforced the Government would have to confiscate the homes of all the pensioners, or else it would be obliged to abandon this legislation. We welcome this opportunity to support the bill, because it bears out everything that we had said in opposition to the 1932 measure. It has not had the effect of easing the burden on the budget, but it has caused a great deal of distress to pensioners and their relatives. A considerable number of pensioners, about 12,000, refused to allow the Government to take a mortgage over their property, and temporarily abandoned their claims to a pension. Gradually, however, the pressure of economic circumstances has forced them back to the pension list. This bill is a complete justification of our criticism of the Government's proposals two years ago, and is an ignominous retreat oh the part of the Government from the course which it then pursued. The Acting Treasurer has asserted that there is no evidence that hardship has been inflicted upon any section of pensioners by this legislation which is now to be repealed. We were told at the time that its purpose was to impress upon the relatives of pensioners some sense of their responsibility. As a matter of fact, on every occasion when the Deputy Commissioners in the various States discovered that the sons or daughters of pensioners were assisting to maintain their parents, the Pensions Department reduced the pension payable. Apparently, the Government took the view that the near relatives of pensioners must contribute to their support in order to assist the budget, then when it found that a certain number were doing this, the pensioners themselves were penalized. I repeat that I am pleased that the bill has been introduced, and it will have my whole-hearted support. The only thing I am sorry for is that the legislation which this bill repeals has caused so much distress to the aged people in this country because of the fear of what might happen to their property following their death. It is all very well for the Acting Treasurer to say that no homes have been confiscated by the Government. He cannot get away from the fact that, in the administration of this law, some pensioners were hardly in their graves before government officials were making demands upon relatives to see what could be obtained from the insurance policies in the names of deceased pensioners. While this legislation was in existence not one insurance policy belonging to any person in this country who might by any conceivable set of circumstances become a pensioner was safe from seizure by the Government. I have been able to demonstrate, not only to the Acting Treasurer (Mr. Casey), but also to officers of the department, that the Government has come in for the remains of an insurance policy as miserable and small as £40. Relatives (have been harassed by the Government's desire to get this money, and its efforts have not been confined to demands upon those relatives who are in a position to treat lightly the claims made against them. But the unfortunate circumstance is that thousands of pensioners in the community have been so harassed by this legislation that the amount of distress of mind created amongst the pioneers of this country cannot be measured in words. At least if the Government has made no charge against the estates of these people the removal from the statute-book of this legislation will give pensioners the peace of mind to which all honorable members agree they are rightly entitled.

I take this opportunity to ventilate the matte;r in order that ' the Government may be able to adopt such measures as may be required to correct a very serious anomaly in respect of the procedure adopted by the Arbitration Court. The members of the tramways employees organization in Adelaide, by the decision of an overwhelming majority, sought to secure from the court an order for the rescission of an order made by Judge Beeby covering the rationing of employees in the Adelaide Municipal Tramway Service. But the representatives of the Tramway Trust, I am informed, contended that such action, would mean a reduction of . the number of employees. The members of the organization, which comprises the whole of the employees in the tramway service, by a very substantial majority, determined to ask the court to revise its decision, in order that the men might be employed on full time for full wages. The Municipal Tramway Trust, since the rationing was introduced, has, I understand, granted to the general public travelling concessions to the value of £25,000 per annum. Although this was mentioned before the Arbitration Court, the court Was not prepared to proceed with the hearing or take that fact into consideration, and refused to make any alteration in the order, which continues to operate. If it is correct that the tramway trust is in a position to make concessions to the travelling public, surely it should be prepared to employ its staff on full time. No one wishes to see men deprived of employment, and possibly the granting of this request would not result in a reduction of the staff at present employed. The court should have heard the case, and made its determination on the facts presented. But it definitely and deliberately declined to have placed before it facts that could have been presented to it, and therefore is not functioning in the manner expected of it. The attitude that it has adopted is giving intense dissatisfaction. Without placing any indignity upon the court, or transgressing the rules of etiquette governing the relations of the court and the parliament, the Government could well suggest that it might hear the evidence that can be placed before it in substantiation of the claim for an improvement of the conditions in the tramway service and the removal of a most objectionable feature in the working arrangements - the rationing scheme that has been in operation for some time.  In the consideration of the legislation that has been before the House this afternoon, it has not been permissible for one to appeal to the Government to give early consideration to the restoration of the old-age pension rate to a maximum of at least £1 a week. During this weekI have received from the Blind Workers' Association a request for the consideration by the Government of an improvement of the conditions of pensioners. If there issolid foundation for the claim of the Government that there has been an improvement in the financial position of Australia, it surely ought to be prepared to make an early restoration of the rate to at least £1 a week.
