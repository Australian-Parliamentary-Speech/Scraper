When he introduced the Bill, Mr. Lloyd George explained that it was designed to prevent the obstruction of British industrial development by the abuse of patent rights. The measure compelled foreigners to work their patents in Great Britain, and prevented them from imposing onerous conditions on British manufacturers using their patents. The measure was passed last year. Speaking at Carnarvon yesterday, Mr. Lloyd George said that the Act was already bringing into the country many foreign industries, and it was anticipated that it would soon provide employment for tens of thousands of British workmen. The Daily Mail, dealing with ' the same subject, states that the Beyer Company, which has a capital of£13,000,000, and represents industrial organizations at Berlin, Elberfeld, and elsewhere, has purchased twenty-four acres of land in Cheshire. Its object is to secure a site for the erection of buildings in connexion with the establishment of an aniline factory. Many Australian manufactures are protected by patents, and as there is a likelihood of some of our manufactories suffering by reason of the use of steam power being superseded by other motive power, I should be pleased if the Minister will consider the advisableness of introducing a Bill on the lines of the new British Patents Act?","BRITISH PATENTS ACT","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","42","FISHER, Andrew","F4N","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I am pleased to have this opportunity of bringing a very important matter under the notice of honorable members. Nobody will deny that the payment of old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealthis a question of urgency. It is a question with which every honorable member is familiar, and upon which the electors have repeatedly expressed their views, and we have now arrived at a stage when this House should at least give an-emphatic expression of opinion regarding its policy on the matter. I know very well that there are difficulties in the way of instituting a Federal system of old-age pensions, but these difficulties we shall surmount as soon as the question is tackled in real earnest by the whole of the members who are pledged upon it. In this case, happily, our constitutional powers are not in doubt. The Constitution expresses in clear and definite language that one of the powers delegated to this. Parliament is the power to legislate at its will in regard to. old-age pensions. That being so, it is not our power under the Constitution that is in doubt. It is a subject upon which th is Parliament is perfectly free to legislate at any moment that it thinks fit. Of course, it would be idle for me to deny that ever since its inception there have been difficulties in the way of the Commonwealth Parliament dealing with the question. No honorable member who is sincere will dispute the statement that Governments have been hampered by the financial provisions of the Constitution, and no honorable member will deny that, however able administrators may have been, a barrier has stood in the way of their raising a sufficient sum through the Customs and Excise to meet the expenditure contingent upon the payment of a Federal old-age pension, namely, £1, 500,000. Under the Constitution we should be compelled to raise £6, 000,000 through the Customs House, before we should be able to retain an amount sufficient to cover the cost of a Federal system of old-age pensions. Undoubtedly, that has been a difficulty from the first. But great as that difficulty is, it does not justify us in standing before the people of the country-and especially the old people who have nothing but their votes to give us-and assuring them that this is an urgent question with which . it is incumbent that Parliament should deal, and that we would see that they obtained justice, and not doing so when returned to Parliament. At this stage of our Federal history I think it becomes honorable members to reflect upon our responsibilities, not only to Parliament, but to the people generally, and particularly to the aged people, whom we have promised so faithfully to help. The history of this question, though not at all flattering to us, is, at least, no more flattering to the Premiers of the States. It is only just to say that early in our history the Federal Government appealed to the States Premiers to allow a sum of money, sufficient for the payment of old-age pensions, in their respective States, to be retained by the Commonwealth, for that purpose out of the surplus money the Commonwealth returns to the States, but that they have repeatedly declined to do so. They have declared, in unmistakable language, that, as far as they are concerned, if the Commonwealth Parliament desires to pay old-age pensions, it must pay them out of increased revenue collected from the people of the Commonwealth. That has undoubtedly more or less embarrassed this Parliament in its action. The reason why I take definite action at the present time is, that it would be intolerable if this question were kept in abeyance for an indefinite period-if we do not say now what we have said upon the platform, namely, that it is a matter which ought to be settled without delay.

The honorable member for Illawarra, I feel sure, is as anxious to do justice to the aged poor in the other States, as he is in the case of his own State'; and without the assistance of members like himself in New South Wales and in Victoria, we, who favour Australian old-age (pensions, might as well beat the air. My appeal is to the representatives of States in which there are not old-age pensions, as well as to representatives of States in which such pensions are the law. And this is a fitting opportunity to say why I am particularly anxious that this question should be dealt with now. Reviewing the history of old-age pensions, we note the singular fact that in New Zealand, New South Wales, and Victoria, in the order named, pension systems were established prior to the inauguration of Federation, whereas in the seven years which have elapsed since, none of the other four States of the Commonwealth have made any serious attempt in this direction. These States, in the matter of old-age pensions, have co-ordinate powers with the Commonwealth, but they have done nothing. Why? The only reason I can give is that which I heard advanced in the State Parliament of Queensland prior to (Federation. Just after the Constitution Bill had been passed, but prior to the inauguration of the Commonwealth, the Labour Party in the Queensland Parliament endeavoured to pass a motion in favour of old-age pensions j but they were met with the contention that this was a matter delegated entirely to the Federal Parliament, who could more fitly deal with it. I agree with-that view, and I go so far as to say that, if all the States Parliaments passed up-to-date and desirable old-age pensions Act's, the schemes would yet be incomplete so far as the Federation is concerned.","Old-age Pensions","SUPPLY (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

But' the fact is significant that during the seven years of the union none of the States have seriously attempted to pass old-age pensions Acts, and this shows that they consider the power is delegated to the Federation. That being so, we are in duty bound to exercise our rights, and do justice to those whose only hope is in this Parliament. It is only fair to say that an Old-Age Pensions Bill has been introduced in the Parliament of Queensland, and partly proceeded with, and that some hints have been given of a similar measure in South Australia. But it is clearly recognised that the States cannot meet the demands of the situation, and; therefore, the duty of legislating-devolves upon us.","Old-age Pensions","SUPPLY (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I asked the Opposition whether they would favour such a measure, and how they would provide the necessary funds, but waited in vain for an answer.

In that statement it will be found that the question of old-age pensions has been considered from the first, and our proposals will be shaped with a view to enable the Government to introduce an old-age pensions measure. Then the details which have been brought before the House this afternoon will, one and all, come under review. The portion of the honorable member's speech in which he alleges the urgency of his motion will pass without question, if the practical situation be taken into account. At last the . period is approaching at which the present distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue will require to be taken into review. The Bill which we submitted to the last Parliament would have anticipated that result; but it was lost, as I have pointed out, by a very narrow margin indeed, considering the late hour of the session at which it required to be submitted. But for that it would have passed both Houses, and unfinancial disability by this time would have been removed. But under existing circumstances, there can be no doubt, as the honorable member has properly urged, that every succeeding year adds, and has added, to the urgency of the question. Having regard to the work which the Parliament has been obliged to undertake-having regard to the distribution of parties and to the expression of the will of the people of the country at the various general elections, and all the other factors which have to be taken into accounts-any fair-minded critic of the Commonwealth Parliament must admit that it has been worthy of its responsibilities. It is easy, if we ignore the difficulties, and generalize or theorize as if those difficulties had not existed-although they are well within the knowledge of every honorable member-to say that the system of pensions could have been put into force before now. At each election the electors have declared that the provision of old-age pensions, from a Federal stand-point, is an imperative duty on this Parliament. That opinion, as the honorable member says, has now been three times affirmed, and nothing but the financial restraints of the Constitution and the other factors to which I have alluded have prevented the question from being effectively dealt with before this time.","Old-age Pensions","SUPPLY (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","220","COOK, Joseph","F4S","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","That will incorporate in the motion a statement repeated over and over again by the leader of the Labour Party to-day. He told us very frankly that, although for the last seven years the party has sat behind the Government, it has not once approached Ministers on the subject of the establishment of a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme, nor exerted the slightest pressure to bring it about. I gave the party credit for more real concern in regard to the matter. For seven years they have had power to compel the Government to take what course they desired, and it is as well that the public should know the complete inertia of the party during the whole of that period, so far as the establishment of a Commonwealth old-age pensions system is concerned. The statement of the honorable member is a sorry reflection on the industry, faithfulness, and loyalty of the party to this question, and a strange comment on the perfervid oratory which has been poured out on the public platform. It would have been far better if, instead of talking on th' sentiment of the subject, about which we are all agreed, honorable members had insisted on the Government bringing this matter forward at a time when the finances were in a state enabling it to be dealt with. But now that our resources are becoming more and more straitened, the Labour Party has suddenly awakened to the need for exerting pressure on the Government, and the honorable member has therefore made this appeal to the House-it would seem in the confident hope and belief that we would oppose the motion. Had we done so, the party would have been able to say, ' We did our best. We brought the matter forward, but the members of the Opposition voted against us.'. We are not going to be caught by chaff of that kind. The motion is absolutely idle as it stands. If it is passed, we shall still have to consider the question of ways and means, and a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme can be brought forward only by the Government. Therefore, honorable members would have done better to apply pressure to the Government which they support, and which they hold in the hollow of their hand. The Prime Minister made allusion to the proposals of the Government last Parliament for financing an old-age pensions scheme. He spoke of the effort to impose special duties for the purpose, and of the defeat of the proposal in the other Chamber. I gave that proposal my opposition for what I regarded as sufficient reasons. It had been announced that our surplus revenue for that financial year would be £750,000, but since the announcement was made the surplus expanded to over £1,000,000. Last year £3,000.000 was the amount of the surplus revenues returned to the States. Two of the largest States already have old-age pensions systems in force, and with an arrangement it would not be necessary to raise half the estimated amount of £1,500,000 per annum in order to-give Australia a fully equipped and effective scheme. Since we already have over £800,000 towards the amount required, and the States have £3,000,000 of surplus revenue to dispose of, the financing; of this scheme within the limits of our present resources-without the imposition of additional duties-becomes a ques: ion of statesmanship which ought not to be beyond the resources of this Parliament to solve. That is the position that some of us took up. It is a position that I was able to justify in my electorate, and I believe that it can be justified on any platform. The position, so far as I know, has not altered. What, meantime, has been done by the. Government? They have taken no step with regard to the States that are backward in this respect. I venture to say that if this House at the beginning had taken up a firm attitude, those States would long ago have passed old-age pensions schemes. But to-day they are sheltering themselves behind this Parliament. They will not accept their own responsibility in the matter, because we say that we will take the scheme upon our own shoulders. There is not an honorable member below the gangway who does not know that if each of the States would actualize an old-age pension scheme there would not be the slightest trouble in federalizing those schemes at the least possible cost. That is-the way of least resistance. It is the most effective method. And yet, because we will not say here that it should be done, the States are burking their own responsibilities with regard' to this very serious, pressing, and urgent problem. That is the attitude that the Opposition have taken up, and I have not a word of apology to offer for it, for I believe that we have adopted the correct course. I shall not oppose this motion. The question of ways and means will be a very serious one to discuss; but I hope soon to see it taken up, and to see realized, in some way or other, a Federal old-age pensions scheme under which there' will be the fullest possible reciprocity of qualification and citizenship, and by which all those hindrances and frictional elements, which cause so much soreness, will be completely obliterated.","Old-age Pensions","SUPPLY (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I, like others, consider that up to a a certain point there is likely to be some difficulty in the way of financing such a scheme.

But why should we draw the necessary funds from the one source? I am not here to-day to outline any financial scheme. I prefer to wait until the Government submit full and complete proposals, feeling satisfied that if they do not meet with my approval I shall have an opportunity then to give expression to my own views. But why should the financing of such a scheme be limited to indirect taxation? The time has arrived when we may fairly ask that a liberal proportion of the moneys necessary to finance a Federal system of old-age pensions shall be obtained bv means of direct taxation. That is my personal opinion, and I Tor one should not hesitate to advocate the financing of the scheme by means of land values taxation.

They certainly would not bask in the smiles of the rich : they would incur the bitter and undying hostility of free-trade and protectionist conservatives alike.

It is not long since the Treasurer told the people of England that they were merely living from hand to mouth, and that their future could be assured to them only by the adoption of a system of preferential trade with Australia. That country, I would remind honorable members, raises in taxation about £1 26,000,000 annually, and spends £31,000,000 annually upon its Navy and £27,000,000 upon its Army. In. addition, the annual interest upon its national debt is £28,000,000. We have a big debt, but I think everybody will admit that there is an immense difference between our-indebtedness and that of Great Britain. The debt of the Old Country is chiefly the result of wars, and consequently no revenue is being received to meet the interest bill, whereas we have assets which are returning interest upon the capital that has been expended. I suppose that there are capitalists in the world who would be prepared to take over the railways of the Commonwealth and in return to guarantee the interest upon our national indebtedness. A country occupying that position may reasonably be asked to Sanction a Federal scheme of old-age pensions which will have no taint of charity about it, and which will apply to all British subjects who have lived in the Commonwealth for the prescribed period.","Old-age Pensions","SUPPLY (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

In my opinion, the honorable member for Parramatta has justly spoken of the delay there has been on the part of this House in the past. The probable recipients of old-age pensions are not a political force and influence which can be brought to bear on honorable members who neglect promises; but' the Prime Minister is of a humane nature, and he knows that, if the session is prolonged, there should be no difficulty in dealing with this question. We have already had three months' holiday, and I see no desperate hurry to rush into recess, especially as we have time after time been told that the winter is the proper time for our work.

Approximately £5,000,000 have been returned to the States since Federation, which the Commonwealth could have expended in paying old-age pensions, or for any other Federal purpose. The Government, instead of using that money as the nucleus of a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund, has shown anything but anxiety to give effect to this benevolent idea. Although the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions has been promised in the speeches of the Governor-General, the Government, instead of making provision for it, has taken over the Meteorological Departments of the States, has incurred responsibility for agricultural bounties amounting to thousands per annum, has proposed the granting of an expensive bounty for the production of iron, has embarked on costly defence schemes, has undertaken to appoint a High Commissioner, has engaged to take over the control of the Northern Territory-which will mean an almost certain deficit of £250,000 per annum-and has expressed its willingness to enter upon other large enterprises, all of which are to take precedence of the establishment of an old-age pensions fund.

The honorable member must recognise that he has made a mistake in charging us with inaction, since we . have attempted in this House, by every means at our disposal, to expedite the passing of an Old-age Pensions Act. We have not only endeavoured to press this question forward, but have shown how such a scheme could be financed. The necessary revenue might be obtained,' for instance, by nationalizing the tobacco monopoly. It could also be obtained by nationalizing the liquor monopoly. Could we do better than utilize the vast amount of wealth that goes to create hundreds Of drunkards in the Commonwealth in a scheme to assist the aged poor? Then again, we could raise revenue for this purpose by means of a graduated land tax, in respect of unimproved land values with an exemption of .£5,000. There are many other ways in which the necessary funds could be provided, but the question of finance is not one for the Labour Party to solve. If we attempted to solve it we should usurp the functions of the Ministry. We have no desire to do more than persuade the Ministry, whom we believe to be as anxious as we are to secure a Federal system, to take action without further delay. Unfortunately, however, in this country we have cheques and bank balances, stone walls, bridges, and hurdles, and all sorts of obstacles that have to be surmounted before we can get the real article. The right honorable member for Swan seemed somewhat disposed to object-although he did not completely do so-to the nationalization of an old-age pension scheme on the ground that under it Western Australia would have to pay more than her fair proportion towards its maintenance. That is true. The Royal Commission, of which I was a member, took evidence in Western Australia, and was informed bv the State Statistician that, on the basis of the equity of its requirements, Western Australia would have to pay a little more under a national scheme than she would be called upon to pay under a State system of old-age pensions. That, however, is due to the fact that she is, comparatively speaking, still very young, and has within her borders a smaller proportion of aged population than have the other States. In a few years, however, the proportion of aged people in Western Australia will be as large as it is in other States of the Commonwealth, and it is' not humane for a State to object to such a project as this on the ground that under it she might lose a little. Under the) Constitution Western Australia was granted the right to maintain for five years a special Tariff on a sliding scale. That really was an infringement of the rights of the other States, but neither little Tasmania nor Victoria raised any objection. However we may adjust the system of distribution, some one must suffer. We are all one people, and I am sorry to hear men who call themselves statesmen speaking in this connexion of territorial divisions.

There has been a great . deal of beating the air in regard to the question this afternoon. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie expressed the opinion that fully 99 per cent, of honorable members are in favour of a Federal old-age pensions scheme, but I believe that the whole of them are perfectly in accord with the proposal. This is a policy which commends itself to the humane feelings of every one, so that objections cannot be anticipated. ' All that remains to be considered is the financing of the scheme; and one honorable member contended that a land tax, while it might not provide the whole of the necessary money would, at any rate, provide a considerable proportion. The party to which I have the honour to belong have on every occasion stated their intention, on the first opportunity, to impose a graduated land tax, with, to my mind, a much too high exemption. But if the specific purpose of such a land tax were effected, there would be no revenue from that source. The idea of imposing a land tax is to burst up the large estates held in Victoria and New South Wales, not with a view to raising revenue, but with a view to promoting settlement; so that, as the tax was effective, there would be a diminishing revenue. I voted for the proposal for special taxation for this purpose; and I am sorry that it was defeated in another place; but, at the same time, I must say that, while I so voted, I knew that the proposal would be the means of imposing a tax on people least able to bear it, because it would have resolved itself into duties on kerosene and tea. Therefore, whilst willing to accept that means of providing revenue for a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund, I felt that it would do a certain amount of injury. But I was compelled to its acceptance by facts within my own knowledge with regard to the circumstances of the people. In New South Wales I know a family where the mother and father are both incapacitated from doing anything to help themselves; but, although qualified in other respects, they have not been long enough in that State to make them eligible for an old-age pension. Under a Federal pension scheme, they would be qualified. Those responsible for the keep of these two old people would willingly pay increased duties to obtain the pension.

Members of the Opposition have done what he has; never done; they have supported in Parliament the establishment of an old-age pensions scheme. Not only did I support the measure which, in New South Wales, provided for the payment of old-age pensions by the State, but I also favour the transference of control in this matter to the Commonwealth. I do so for several reasons, one alone of which I think is ample-the gross injustice of the present arrangement. A man who has lived continuously in one State for twenty-five years or more receives a pension on arriving at a certain age, while another man, who may have been much longer, indeed born, in Australia, is prevented from getting a pension because he has migrated from State to State-having perhaps helped more in this way than the stayathpme to develop the country-without living long enough in one State to qualify for a pension. I am, therefore, strongly in favour of the federalization of old-age pensions. I may differ from some honorable members as to the details of such a scheme, but that, after all, is a secondary consideration. I believe that every honorable member of the Opposition favours the federalization of the system.","Old-age Pensions","SUPPLY (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

An endeavour should be made to permanently settle the whole of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, including the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions, provision for the transfer of the States' debts, and for payment for transferred proper-' ties, and an arrangement which, while it would render unnecessary the continuation of the Braddon section of the Constitution, would guarantee that the States would not be left in an unsound financial position.

It is for. that reason that I cannot support the amendment of the honorable member for Dalley. Some honorable members have referred to the desirableness of establishing a universal system of old-age pensions. Personally, that suggestion does not find favour with me, for the reason that if £1,500,000 be required to cover the cost of a system under which pensions will be granted only to those who require them, a very much larger sum would have to be provided to cover the cost of a universal system. In that regard I would point out that those who really require old-age pensions certainly contribute to the revenue out of which those pensions are paid. They contribute directly through the Customs in proportion to the goods which they consume, and they also contribute indirectly to an extent which we cannot fathom, because a large portion, we cannot say how much, of any taxation imposed passes on to the masses of the community. Under a universal system of old-age pensions, these persons would be compelled to contribute towards tha additional amount, probably three or four times as much, required to cover its cost. In other . words, they would be contributing a large additional sum for the payment of pensions to persons who are well-to-do. My opinion is that, while there may be grave doubts as to whether many old persons who are badly off have really earned pensions, there can be no doubt that those who have done well in the country, and who have reaped their reward, .should not be permitted to come upon it for an additional reward in the shape of a pension which they do not require.","Old-age Pensions","SUPPLY (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/continue[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

He has made a declaration which I am sure the deputy leader of the Opposition and some other members of his party would not dare to make. I do not intend, however, to labour this question. I think that a solution of the difficulty is to be found in the direction indicated by the Prime Minister. Under present conditions the only course open to the Government is to submit to the Premiers' Conference a proposal which is calculated to appeal to them. The Premiers of the States should be asked to assist the Government in making a financial adjustment that will permit of a Federal system of old-age pensions. In the absence of such an adjustment we shall have to resort to direct taxation or wait until the Braddon section and the machinery under it can be remodelled towards the close of this or the beginning of the next Parliament. The financial problem lies at the root of this proposal. Hitherto a practical opportunity to do anything in this direction has not presented itself.

Last session the Prime Minister took a most drastic course-which I think was open to a good deal of argument on the score of its wisdom-in invading this part of the Constitution, with the avowed object of hurrying on a settlement of the old-age pensions question. We know what was the fate of that measure; it passed through this House, and was lost in another place.-At any rate, every one will admit that bv that action last session, the Government did all they could to expedite matters. Further, His Excellency's speeches in opening Parliament have reiterated the intention of the Government to see whether means could not be found of dealing with the question.

I did not' mean that the Commonwealth administration would be twice as costly as State administration. I am willing to believe that one would be as economical as the other. But, inasmuch as the population of Western Australia is largely composed of persons in the prime of life, and there are not many aged poor there to whom this Act would apply, the sum necessary to establish an adequate pensions fund for local State purposes would be less than £50,000 a year, whereas a Commonwealth pensions scheme would cost £1,500,000,' to which Western Australia's contribution per capita would be about £100,000. Western Australia would therefore probably contribute to a Commonwealth fund £50,000 more than was needed for her own requirements, and this sum would be spent in relieving the aged and deserving poor in the other States. Of course, we have many deserving old men in our Benevolent Asylum; but they are mostly so decrepit that they cannot look after themselves, .and if would be cruel to induce them to take pensions.

Still, it was thought to be popular to say, ' We are opposed to taxing the food of the poor man,' and that was made another platform cry, which, when analyzed, means that we want to provide for the aged poor, but rather than obtain some of the revenue necessary from a tax on tea, we will let the aged poor suffer and go without their pension, forgetting, also, that sugar is taxed to the extent of £6 a ton-a tax which every one has to pay.

Personally I shall support any proposal to initiate a national scheme of old-age pensions, no matter from what-party it may emanate. It is absolutely common-sense that every indigent and aged or invalid person who has resided in the Commonwealth for a certain period should receive a pension, irrespective of the time that he or . she may have been resident in any particular State. I wish very briefly to indicate-the limitations. which I place upon my support of any Federal scheme, for the payment of old-age pensions. In the first place, the scheme must be a common-sense and equitable one. I shall not support a universal system of pensions. I favour making the conditions under which these pensions are granted as little humiliating as possible, and also insuring that the inquiries instituted in respect of applicants for them shall be conducted as privately as possible. In the second place, it must be conclusively shown that we are able to finance the scheme without overstraining the capacity of the country for taxation. Lastly, the Commonwealth must not trench upon the power of direct taxation which is the only' avenue of taxation left to the States should their share of Customs and Excise revenue prove insufficient, and is the Commonwealth's reserve of taxation in time of national emergency. It seems to me that the proposals of the Labour Party for universal pensions, irrespective of necessity, are unreasonable, and would involve the capacity of the country to bear taxation being unduly strained. The inevitable result would be that when an urgent demand was made for further taxation-as might occur in case of war-our primary industries, and also a great many of the secondary industries dependent upon them, would be absolutely ruined. Within the limits I have indicated, I shall be prepared to support any. scheme for the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions, irrespective of the party from which it may emanate. I am thoroughly satisfied that whatever State politicians may think of the matter, the people of the Commonwealth will be behind us in enacting the necessary legislation to give effect to such a scheme on a national basis.

It seems to me that the Opposition is suffering more from pique than a genuine desire to correct error, and I am surprised that men should exhibit such childish petulence in connexion with a matter of so much importance to the Commonwealth. This may be orthodox Opposition tactics, but it is not statesmanship, and it does not appeal to my commonsense. The proposition in regard to earmarking a portion of the Customs revenue, or the proceeds of a progressive land tax, do not appeal to me, because the revenue from such sources, should the taxation prove effective, must be a diminishing quantity. The poor we have always with us, and we must have a permanent means of assisting them in their old age. In the case of a progressive land tax the object is to break up the big estates, and the Tariff is designed to protect local industries; and, therefore, as I have already said; the resultant revenue must be a diminishing quantity, if the taxation achieves its purpose. It has been suggested that special duties on tea and kerosene should be imposed for the purpose of old-age pensions. The honorable member for Kooyong, and the right honorable member for Swan, declare that these commodities represent legitimate sources of revenue for such a purpose, on the principle that those who receive pensions should furnish the funds. I contend that that is taking a one-sided view of the subject, because the idea underlying the principle of old-age pensions is that a certain section of the community are not getting what they earn-that their contributions to the general wealth are aggregating in the hands of a Few, while they them-selves are afforded a mere living. On that account' we say that when those workers can no longer assist in the creation of wealth-and we know that all wealth is the result, of actual effort-the State shall say to them, ' You have done well in helping to build up the country, and you shall now be compensated in your old age for being unable to save anything from your labours when an able-bodied man.' . It is admitted that the workers are not able to live decently and lay by enough for their old age, but according to some honorable members it-would be a proper course to tax their tea and kerosene by means of which they are enabled to live and work, in order that when they are old and decrepit they may have a pension. To impose such taxation would simply make it harder for the people whom we set out to benefit, and on that ground I regard it as unfair and iniquitous. In my opinion there must be some stable economic source of revenue for such a permanent institution as old-age pensions, and, therefore, I at once turn to a tax on unimproved land values. It will be generally admitted that it is only in land values that the collective wealth of. the country is expressed. If those men and-women have worked all their lives in the country, the result of their labour can be permanently expressed only in the enhanced value of the land, and this, therefore, becomes a legitimate source of revenue for providing for their old age. It has been contended that such a tax would duplicate the functions of the States, but so far as I can gather, provision is made for the utilization of the State machinery in cases where the functions of the States and Commonwealth , Governments dovetail; and therefore there should be no difficulty on that score. With all due deference to the Prime Minister, a proposal that a certain amount of State land revenue shall be handed over to the Federal Government on the latter undertaking to pay old-age pensions, is well worth submitting to the Premiers' Conference. A nominal tax of £d. in the pound on unimproved values would return considerably over .£1,000.000. As I have said, it is only by actual effort that real wealth is created, though, of course, those who control and supervise add to values, and, by their very position, are able to appropriate the greater share;' and it is for those who do not get. anything like the full value of their labour, that provision should be made. Therefore there is nothing of charity in the pension, although the honorable member for Echuca dwelt upon what he was pleased to regard as its charitable aspect. Charity, no doubt, is a very fine virtue, but, seeing that its exercise is possible only by reason of the suffering and want of those to whom the charitable dispense their largesse, it is doubtful whether its necessity is a blessing. As to . whether pensions should be given to all, or. merely to the needy, I cannot go with those of my confreres who advocate a universal pension system. I do not think that such a system is possible under our present social conditions. The inequalities resulting from the unequal distribution of wealth would make a universal pension system ridiculous. But when the Government controls all sources of wealth; in other words, when we have a socialistic State, which will come when the people want it, a universal pensions system will be its natural complement. But the inquiries which are necessary under the more limited pension system with which I think we must for the present be contented, might very well be held in camera, to avoid needless publicity. That, I think, would remove all reasonable objections to it.","Old-age Pensions","SUPPLY (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[23]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Undoubtedly the honorable member for Wide Bay, by his action this afternoon, has enabled us to make a step in advance in this matter; because I think the House will agree to his proposal, and the Prime Minister has promised to make every effort to give effect to it. But I object to the attempt on the part of the honorable member for Dalley to take the wind out of the sails of the Labour Party, and the further attempt of the honorable member for Kennedy to see how far the honorable member for Dalley will go.

The securing of the full results of their . industry to all producers by the collective ownership of monopolies, and the. extension of the industrial and economic functions of the States and municipalities. The fighting platform is as follows-Maintenance of a white Australia. Nationalization of monopolies. Old-age pensions. Tariff referendum. Progressive tax on unimproved land values. Restriction of public borrowing. Navigation laws. Citizen defence force. Arbitration Act amendment. The general platform includes-Maintenance of a white Australia. Nationalization of Monopolies-if necessary, amendment of Constitution to provide for same. Old-age pensions. Referendum of Commonwealth electors on the Tariff question when the report of the Tariff Commission has been completed; the Party to give legislative effect to the decision of the' referendum vote. Progressive tax on unimproved land values. Restriction of public borrowing. Navigation laws, to provide-(a) for the protection of Australian shipping against unfair competition; (b) registration of all vessels engaged in the coastal trade; (c) the efficient manning of vessels; (d) the proper supply of life saving and other equipment; (e) the regulation of hours and conditions of work; (/) proper accommodation for passengers and seamen; proper loading gear, and inspection of same; compulsory insurance of crews by ship owners against accident or death. Citizen defence forces and Australian-owned navy. Amendment of Commonwealth Arbitration Act to provide for preference of unionists and exclusion of the legal profession. Commonwealth bank of deposit and issue, and life and fire insurance department, the management of each to be free from political influence.-11. Uniform industrial legislation; amendment of Constitution to provide for same. Civil equality of men and women. It will be seen, therefore, that in respect of the taxation of land values, our platform contains no reference whatever to a £5,000 exemption. In the face of this evidence, the honorable member for Parramatta might well have accepted my assurance.

He does not need to withdraw it, because it is not in the possession of the House until Mr. Speaker puts it from the Chair, but once that step has been taken no honorable member can take the question out of the consideration of the House without the consent of the House itself.
