Protests have been made from time to time by certain bodies in Malaya because some Malayan nationals, wartime evacuees to this country, have been asked, and obliged in a few instances, to return to their own country. If there is to be any criticism of the Government's action it will be quite easy for the Australian Government to prove that in Malaya itself laws have been passed forbidding the entry into Malaya of Indians and Chinese; and in the case, of Burma, a law came into operation on the 1st July of last year forbidding the entry of any more Indians into that country. So the Malayan people themselves have exercised a right which we claim to exercise, that is, to say who shall come and live among us permanently. The other matters raised by the honorable member concerning Mr. McNamara's activities abroad are properly the- subject of inquiry by the External ' Affairs Department I will confer with the Minister acting for the .Minister for External Affairs, and he, no doubt, will give a reply to the honorable gentleman in due course.","MALAYAN SEAMEN","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, the governors of the International Monetary Fund were not very happy about the method adopted to effect the devaluation, namely, the institution of what might be termed the ' double franc ', whereby half the proceeds of France's external sales were given to the French National Bank and half left in a free market for the purpose of purchasing dollars, gold and Portuguese currency. I take the view, which is, I think, shared by most people who have interested themselves in the matter, that that will not be a good arrangement unless strict exchange control is exercised by the French Government. The United Kingdom and, I think, the International Monetary Fund, entertain grave doubts as to the wisdom 'f introducing the double franc.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","79","CHAMBERS, Cyril","JWR","Adelaide","ALP","Minister for the Army","294",". - by leave - In September, 1944, Cabinet introduced National Security (Disposal of Commonwealth Property) Regulations No. 87, which set up the Commonwealth Disposals Commission for the purpose of disposing of all property, equipment, stores and supplies acquired or used in connexion with the defence of the Commonwealth and which were no longer required. I shall show that in this connexion, the Department of the Army has played a very prominent part.  Although this statement mainly covers disposals on the mainland, I should like to state that Army's activities also covered the disposal of stores and equipment, located in the following areas, where the Australian Military Forces had functioned- New Guinea and Papua, Borneo, Balikpapan, and Morotai. Disposals in these areas netted many thousands of pounds for the Commonwealth through the sale of equipment, which, owing to the lack of shipping for its return to the mainland, may have been a considerable loss to Australia. In addition, its release helped considerably with the re-establishment of production and industry in the islands and the release of army man-power for return to the mainland for rehabilitation. As was inevitable at the conclusion of a national crisis, there were large quantities of stores of all kinds in hired buildings, as well as in drill halls, and other buildings, which had, in war, no activities of the kind for which they had been built, namely the assembly, training and administration of Citizen Force units. To-day, not only have all hired premises been returned to civilian owners, but also the disposal of surplus goods has enabled complete installations to be cleared and sold. Other installations have been reduced in capacity, and the space cleared by disposal utilized for transfer of stores for post-war retention, with particular emphasis on armaments, technical stores, and motor transport vehicles, for which at the conclusion of hostilities there was open storage only. Although I have not included amounts in the figures which relate solely to Australian Military Forces disposals, I should like to mention that the Department of the Army was charged with the processing for disposal of a large number of United States of America camps, hospitals and installations, chiefly in Queensland and New South Wales. Further, when the United States forces ceased activities in Australia, appreciable quantities of stores were handled on their behalf by the Australian Army salvage organization, and it is of interest to note that in Brisbane alone, some 35,000 tons were taken over from the United States Navy. During the period under review many thousands of individual declarations of stores, equipment, &c, for disposal by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission have been made. In addition, stores to the value of many millions of pounds have been assigned to other dominions and service departments, necessitating much unpacking, checking, accountancy, re-packing and disposal by Army personnel who, ever since the cessation of hostilities, have been constantly decreasing in numbers, the loss of technically trained personnel being foremost. During this period the army depots have had to carry on with the maintenance supply of the forces, including the forces in Japan, and it is estimated that a gross dead weight tonnage of 140,091 tons has been handled, packed and shipped by the Army. Throughout the Army's declaration, special attention has been given to items in urgent civil demand, particularly those which it is considered will be readily procurable when the present civil demand has abated. The following will give an indication of the large volumes of stores, &c, involved, and the approximate initial cost of the various categories of stores declared to the commission : - (a)Declared to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission : - (6)Released to other dominions, government departments and/or trading firms and companies - The disposal of such a great quantity of stores has assisted towards the regeneration of industry and commerce on a post-war basis, as will be. seen by the following':- (a)103,432 vehicles, &a, have been disposed of; and (6)main general engineer and building items, and mechanical equipment released over the period under review - The Department of the Army, knowing the shortage of motor vehicle spare parts in the civil market, gave an undertaking to -assist in the conservation of dollars by perusing the major automotive companies overseas orders and supplying what motor vehicle parts were available from Army stocks. From this, it will be deduced that from an early stage the Army action has resulted in savings in the dollar exchange and this has been increased since the sale of 103,347 vehicles, together with the value shown above of spare parts to the extent of £3,285,000.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS COMMISSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","81","CHAMBERS, Cyril","JWR","N/A","N/A","N/A","296","- There are still minor declarations in motor transport vehicles, but in the matter of motor transport spares and accessories it is estimated that approximately an additional 8,500 tons are being declared to the commission as a result of the lowering of the Army's motor transport holding from 25,000 to 10,000. This figure, added to approximately 9,000 tons which are already in the hands of the commission, shows that it is possible to make considerable additional dollar savings in the future. It is anticipated that all bulk declarations except for certain lines at Bandiana in motor transport stores will be in the hands of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission prior to the 31st March, 1948. When these declaration? are completed, there will remain only surpluses arising from changes in policy and in war material to be further dealt with. The storehouse accommodation has been contracted to the same degree with the sale of goods declared, and it will bo appreciated that once all the declared stores have been sold, the Army storehouses and vehicle depots will contain only those items required for the postwar Army.  I emphasize that the forces of to-day are much more in need of technical equipment than even in 1941 when Japan entered the recent war, and that the Citizen Forces, which will still form the larger component of the Australian Military Forces, must have the latest equipment in sufficient quantities to make the training interesting and the Army effective. Motor transport vehicles are included here as .technical equipment for two main reasons: First, it will be impossible to buy W.D. type vehicles for some years to come; and, secondly, the Army is more and more dependent on mechanical means of transport with good cross-country performance; and it is axiomatic that sufficient motor transport must be available for the training of drivers and the haulage of the modern equipment with which a modern army must be supplied. In conclusion, I invite attention to the co-operation of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission with the Department of the Army, with advantage to both. With the wide range of commodities and stores, many of no apparent civilian use, it is easily understood that there was difficulty in placing lines unattractive to the general community. During the last twelve months, however, there has been considerable movement and such items are now being cleared.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS COMMISSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Honorable members have mainly centred their arguments on trade agreements, and the matter of employment has not arisen to any degree. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) paid unwitting compliments to the Ministers whose reports are being debated by refraining from going into the merits of the cases presented in them. The Leader of the Opposition confined himself to the question of which were the better - bi-lateral or multi-lateral agreements? The Leader of the Australian Country party confined himself to production in Australia. His speech consisted of what may be regarded as good propaganda for the Opposition to put before the people. I refer first to what both right honorable gentlemen described as the drift from primary production to secondary production in the metropolitan areas. The Leader of the Australian Country party charged the Government with having concentrated its attention on the distribution of products and neglected the production side. One would think from what the right honorable gentlemen said that the drift from the country to the cities in Australia is unique, but I propose to cite a few figures to prove otherwise. Honorable gentlemen opposite would have the people believe that that drift has been accentuated by the policy of the Australian Labour Government, but the figures that I shall cite, which are supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician, give the lie to that contention. In 1921 37.35 per cent, of Australia's population lived in rural areas. In 1933 the percentage was 35.91, and in 1947 it was 31.06.  Statistics for the United States of America show a similar decline of its rural population. I am not able to cite exactly comparable years, but the periods are sufficiently comparable to prove my point. In 1920 48.8 per cent, of the population of the United States lived in rural areas. By 1930 the rural population had dropped to 43.8 per cent, of the total population. So, in ten. years, from 1920 to 1930, the rural population of the United States of America fell from 48.8 per cent, to 43.8 per cent., a drop of 5 per cent., whereas, in twelve years in Australia,, from 1921 to. 1933, the drop was from 37.35 per cent, to 35.91 per cent., a drop of 1.44 per cent. The figures disclosed by the next Australian Census of 1947 show that the rural population dropped from 35.91 per cent, in 1933, to 31.06 percent, in 1947. The latest figures available in the United States of America are those for 1940, when the rural population was 43.5 per cent, of the total. So, from 1921 to 1947, a period of 26 years, Australia's rural population dropped from 37.35 per cent, to 31.06 per cent., a drop of 6.29 per cent., whereas in twenty years from 1920 to 1940 the rural population of the United States of America dropped from 48.8 per cent, to 43.5 per cent., a drop of 5.3 per cent. That shows that the implication that a socialistic or Labour government in Australia is responsible for the drift to the cities is entirely unfair and erroneous, because, in the United States of America, where there never has been a Labour government, and where the government has always been of the same brand or has had the same ideas as the Opposition parties in this Parliament, whether it has been Republic or Democrat-","N/A","INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I now turn to figures relating to employment in rural industries. Usually, the percentage of people engaged in rural industries in relation to population is fairly constant from one country to another. In 1921 in Australia, 25.75 per cent, of the people employed in industry were employed in rural industry. By 1947, only 18.96 per cent, of the total number of employees in industry were employed in rural industries - a drop in 26 years of 5.4 per cent. I propose to compare those figures with figures for Canada, another British Dominion, in which it will not be contended that a Labour or socialistic government has held office. From 1921 to 1941, the percentage of employees engaged in rural industry declined from 38.2 to 31.7, a drop of 6.5 per cent, in twenty years. Those figures may not be related to the tariff policy, but they are an answer to arguments advanced by the Leader of the Australian Country party. In England, in 1911, 1,007 of every 10,000 persons employed in industry were engaged in rural industry. In 1921, the ratio had dropped to 877 to every 10,000, and, in 1931, the latest year for which figures are available, it was only 757 to every 10,000. Those figures demonstrate that when members of the Opposition acc use the Government of being responsible for the decline of primary production they are ignorant of the general world trend. The number of persons working in rural industries is governed largely by the alteration of methods of production. For example, a farmer, instead of using an 8-horse team and ploughing five or six acres a day, use s a tractor and covers three times the area in the same number of hours. A comparison of production under methods in use 25 years ago with production under present conditions is unfair.  At the Geneva conference, excellent work was done. In the statement which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) made to the House on tariffs and trade, reference was made to Empire preference. The principle argument which members of the Opposition have used in this debate is that the Government has surrendered some of the Empire preferences which were so beneficial to Australia. I desire to make .a few observations about that contention. The leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) stated that Australia should have retained the bilateral system of trade agreements. I remind the right honorable gentleman that the bulk of Australia's bilateral agreements have been made with Great Britain. In deciding whether these bilateral agreements should be retained, Australia would not have the sole voice. The British Government, as the other interested party, could not be disregarded. The Leader of the Opposition implied that if Australia had adopted a firm attitude against any alteration of Empire preferences, they could have been retained. The fallacy of that contention should be exposed. Empire preference and the Ottawa Agreement went into the melting pot when international trade was disrupted by 'World War II. At the Geneva conference, Great Britain was in a different position from that which it occupied when the Ottawa Agreement was made. After the deadlock had occurred at the Geneva conference regarding the proposal of the United States of America to increase the duty on its importations of Australian wool, the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman) and Dr. Coombs, Australia's leading economic advisor at the conference, returned- to Australia for the purpose of explaining the position to the Government. At the time, many people who are deeply interested in Empire preferences and international trade generally, feared for the fate of Empire preference. For my part, I felt an anxiety that if Australia stood firmly for the retention of Empire preference, Great Britain would be forced to announce that it must be abolished. Despite those events at Geneva, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) have informed the Parliament and the people that the Government was weak, and had not acted in the best interests of Australia. In my opinion, the contentions of both right honorable gentlemen were extremely weak, and will not bear a close examination. Their condemnation of the Government for the adoption of multilateral as against bilateral agreements was not worthy of them. Most people in Australia, and, indeed, throughout the world, had reached the definite conclusion that conditions of trade should be freed from the germs of war. In the past, wars have been caused because of restrictions placed upon the freedom of. trade. Indeed, one of the greatest causes of international disruption has been the inability of some countries to trade with others. That position was created principally by bilateral agreements between countries. When we in Australia speak of an agreement regarding tariffs and trade, we must realize that many of the countries represented at the Geneva conference were not so much concerned about tariff barriers affecting foodstuffs and primary produce generally as they were about manufactured goods. America is not concerned with the export of foodstuffs to this country. Our imports of foodstuffs from America are very small indeed compared with the quantity of other commodities that we receive from that country. America's great concern is with the export of manufactured goods. Twenty years ago, protracted debates took place in this House on the question of giving protection to Australian secondary industries. A country imposes high tariffs for one of two reasons: either it is seeking revenue, or it wishes to protect its own industries. It is inevitable that in any discussion of international trade by representatives of 18 nations the thought uppermost in the mind of each will be the welfare of his own country, and it is only natural that in this debate the viewpoint of the Australian people should be expressed most forcibly. Consideration must be given to the question of how these proposals will affect this country. The main argument against them is that they will necessitate the abandonment of the Ottawa Agreemen and Empire preferences generally. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman), in his statement in this House, said -","N/A","INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Just as we view with mistrust the collaboration of other countries to exchange trade preference, so other nations of the world mistrust Empire collaboration for the same purpose. Members of the Australian delegation to the trade conferences believed that whilst it was essential to protect so far as possible what we had achieved in the past, it was also necessary to discuss the future with the representatives of other countries in a spirit of reasonableness. I make it clear that I still believe firmly in a proper measure of. protection for Australian industries. I still believe also that we should make the best possible arrangements with other countries which produce goods that we require, and which want goods that we produce. I should not like anybody to think that I am advocating free trade. I realize that such a policy could only be to our detriment. It is clear that we cannot jettison entirely the tariffs 'that we have imposed in the past; but we must not lose sight of the fact that with world trade turned topsy-turvy by the war, and with the allied countries insisting upon depriving our former enemies of their right to regain their former industrial greatness, tariff equilibrium has been upset. Honorable members opposite who, in this debate, have sought to cast doubt upon the integrity of the Government and of the Minister who represented this country at the international discussions, are rendering a great disservice not only to themselves but also to Australia. It is gratifying indeed that our delegation approached this difficult problem with a much wider outlook than that exhibited by some members of the Opposition in the past few days. In the attitude of our representatives there was no evidence of the old desire to get all they could for themselves whilst ignoring the rights of other nations. It is all very well to insist upon having the best end of the :stick .all the time, but it is clear that if *e are to have improved economic conditions throughout the world we must approach this question of tariffs in the spirit in which it has been approached by our representatives at Geneva.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/para[6]","N/A","N/A"

When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) spoke yesterday, he said that the tariff agreements which have been discussed in this debate cannot be regarded as having been concluded until the results of the Havana trade conference have been announced. We are therefore compelled to debate the matter somewhat in the dark. The document placed before us is certainly a large one, and it is of the utmost import ance because it will determine, to a considerable extent, the part which this country is to play in the trade of the world. I should like the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman), who has recently returned from Havana, to have spoken on the matter before I made my contribution to this debate. How can we appreciate the implications of this document until we know more of what transpired at Havana? I understand that so far as the proceedings at that conference affect the decisions reached at the previous conference at Geneva all is not well. It seems that the hopes entertained earlier for the full and free development of world trade on the lines of Geneva may not be realized because of the reactions of some of the nations which were represented at Havana. Many of them believe that the general agreement reached *at Geneva is not, practicable. The Minister may be hMo to clarify some of the matters on which we are at present in doubt, but he has not yet made his speech. In an effort to inform my mind I have examined this extremely lengthy document, which contains innumerable provisions and ' escape ' provisions. It impresses me as a queer mixture of ideology, practical aims and utter nonsense, and that is the only way in which I can regard it.  The history of world diplomacy from World War I. until now indicates the existence of a tendency on the part of victorious nations to endeavour to remove the causes of war by eliminating trade barriers, which are a constant source of international -friction. That tendency is evident in the document now before us, but I do not think that those who drafted this document conducted a proper research into the nature and history of the problems confronting the world. After World War I. the situation which emerged was in many respects similar to that which is developing now. The United States of America, which had previously been a debtor country, emerged from that war as a. large creditor nation, whereas Great Britain declined from its position as one of the principal creditor nations to that of a country with only limited credit balances. To any one who interested himself in world economy at that time it was obvious that the United States of America could only continue to maintain its position as a large creditor nation by making substantial loans to nations in financial difficulties, and by reducing its tariff barriers so as to encourage the entry of goods produced in other parts of the world. Certainly some attempt was made to implement those policies, but it was only a half-hearted one. In the years preceding 'World 'War II. the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Cordell Hull, was empowered to lower America's tariff barriers to a limited extent, but the exigencies of the times demanded the adoption of a much more liberal policy. Earlier the American Government had been incapable of combatting the long series of difficulties which developed, culminating in the world economic crisis. It was that situation which resulted to a great extent in the emergence of Europe's dictators. Any one who is familiar with recent European history knows that Hitler's rise to power was almost entirely on the votes of Germany's unemployed. The actions of Hitler and Mussolini resulted in further barriers being erected to obstruct the free flow of world trade. x Germany under Hitler was simultaneously applying a trading policy and an economic policy which were intended to make it self-sufficient when war came, and Italy was doing likewise. This situation developed largely because the United States had failed to play its proper part in the reconstruction of the world's economy after 'World 'War I., and because of the attempts of some countries to develop their trade at the expense of other nations. The aftermath of World War II. has witnessed a number of idealist attempts to evolve a new world order, the principal object of which is to eliminate the causes of war. Some people think that by bringing all the nations together international trade may be made to flow more freely; but their efforts are handicapped by the failure to realize the reasons why trade is not flowing freely to-day. The document before us reveals the presence of this hopeful ideology in the minds of its authors. Certainly, it does give expression to some ideas, but those ideas seem to be mainly the advantage of one nation. The United States of America emerged from World War II. as a tremendously powerful nation, economically and diplomatically. Whilst it did not suffer the ravages of war, it certainly profited handsomely from the needs of the Allies for material for operations in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the war resulted in most of the world's gold being concentrated in the United States of America. Before the United States of America entered the war, it was necessary for the British Empire to deliver vast quantities of gold and securities to the United States in order to obtain the wherewithal to finance its armament programme. Today the United States of America is in a superlative position and has become, in some respects, the virtual dictator of the world. Towards the end of the war I think that those in authority in the United States foresaw that the economic decline of the British Empire in the postwar world required that America should assert itself, if it were to maintain the pre-eminent position to which it had attained. I do not make these remarks about American policy in any unfriendly spirit; indeed, I welcome the fullest cooperation with America. At the same time, however, I suspect that that country has always been jealous of the trade of the British ' Empire, and when its leaders determined to consolidate the position of pre-eminence which their country had won during the war, I believe that they did so without realizing the role which the United States would be called upon to discharge. The policy which they should have adopted is identical with the one which should have been adopted after World War I.; but Americans do not seem to have realized that. They thought that if America could continue to export on the same scale as during and immediately after the war even higher standards of living would be created for their people. We know that that is a fallacy and that trade cannot flow freely in only one direction.. I think the aim of the United States of America in these negotiations was to make permanent its superiority in regard to its role in world affairs and the standard of Hying -of its .people without due consideration to international re-actions. In the main, this .document contains little sense. In order to bring together the .representatives of 3i0 or 40 nations with different aims .and sentiments and in varying .stages of development, and to expect them to prepare a document containing non-discriminatory clauses applicable to all of them, it is necessary to asume that a new world has been created, containing new people and fresh physical and economic features. I cannot visualize .an organization such as is proposed ever becoming a reality or of permanent benefit to the world.. Undoubtedly when the representative of the nations met together they desired ,to establish certain basic principles for the freeing of the channels of trade and the creation of a better standard of Jiving for the peoples of the world. Having come to conclusions on general principles, they were then faced with the practical difficulty of drafting provisions to meet the differing requirements of the various nations, and as ,a result there are in this document reservations and ' escape ' provisions, some of which are so vague and worked in such an extraordinary manner that I defy any honorable member to say what they mean. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) is trained to interpret intricate documents, but lie admits without hesitation that he finds it almost impossible to decide what this document means. One gentleman, representing a large, trade organization in Australia, has said that he handed the document to a barrister friend in Sydney and asked him to interpret certain provisions of it, whereupon the barrister looked at it. turned it upside down, thought of a number, added another number, subtracted the number of which he first thought, and at last said that all he could think it meant was that bottled beer could not be sold in Sydney after 6 p.m. I defy any one to say that he fully understands some of these provisions, yet some international organization will need to interpret the document as it affects all the nations that signed it. So far as I can see, the intention is that some international organization - some new bureaucratic growth - shall tell this country exactly what its policy is .to be, without having any real knowledge of its state of development, .and its difficulties. I foresee nothing but failure if that is to be done. Something to the advantage ,as well as to the disadvantage of Australia has emerged from these discussions. There has been a reduction of the rate of duty imposed by the United States of America on imports of Australian wool. That reduction was of more assistance to the United States than the maintenance of the duty at the previous high level. It is well known that the additional cost to the American people caused by the previous high rate of duty imposed on Australian wool amounted to more than the total value of the American wool clip. I do not accept the proposition that the new duty on wool could not have been arranged by means of a bilateral agreement. Other proposals constitute a grave danger to certain Australian industries. Some of the non-discriminatory proposals menace our sugar and cotton industries as well as certain allied industries. Any instruction given by this proposed organization in respect of the sugar, cotton or tobacco industries of the world could result in the collapse of those industries in Australia. Though capable of expansion in present conditions, their exposure to direct competition from Japan or other Eastern countries could well sound their deathknell. Whilst there is something of value in this agreement, there is also much that is dangerous to many of Australia's primary industries and to the secondary industries depending upon them. I have come to the conclusion that the set-up envisaged is impracticable. If the agreement is impracticable because it cannot meet the individual needs of a particular nation, it must fail. If it fails, all that has been done is to create a barrier to world trade at a time when it is vitally important that world trade should recover. The leader of the Opposition made a good point, when he said that what was needed was not a scheme for distribution but a scheme for increased production. The right honorable gentleman pointed out thai; Australia was importing and exporting less, on a tonnage basis, than in 1939. The figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician show that since 1939 the number of persons employed in factories and rural industries has increased by 50 per cent, and 1 per cent, respectively. There has been a drift from one set of industries to another. In one case the increase is small and in the other case it is large, but we are exporting and importing less. What the world is searching for to-day is a solution of the problem of securing increased production. If production is increased, many of the problems connected with distribution may disappear, or, if they do not, a more practical approach may be made to them in the light of experience. I am told that there is a danger of the Latin-American countries withdrawing from the Havana conference. I am also informed that there is great concern at the agreements made by Great Britain. That country has, I understand, made some sixteen or eighteen bilaterial agreements since these proposals were first put forward. That proves that the nations of the world are unwilling to abide by the genera] principles of the Geneva agreement. That is due to the fact that in the extremes nations have to do something to save their own economies. Thus, Britain has approached Denmark, Russia and other countries, and made trade agreements with them. The nations have found immediate action necessary in order to keep trade moving and to feed their people. Russia is not a party to this trade agreement, and yet the Russian land mass is rapidly becoming one of the greatest empires of all time. Within the last day or two, we have seen the Communist deluge engulf Czechoslovakia, which was quickly becoming an important factor in world trade. Now it will he pauperized, as every country has been that has come under Communist control. The effect may not be immediately apparent, but, eventually we shall note the gradual pauperization of the people of Czechoslavakia and the elimination of Czechoslovakia as a world trading nation. Wherever individual initiative, urge and drive, with the consequent stimulus of profit-making, are removed, production must decline, and living standards fall. Russia is closing to international trade a huge area of the earth's surface, including some of the most productive parts of Europe. ' If the Latin-American countries are to withdraw from the trade agreement, if Russia is to stand out, and if many of the countries that originally signed the agreement are to make other agreements among themselves, I cannot see how the agreement that we are now considering will have any real value. If it is proposed to put the agreement into effect, a great new bureaucracy will have to be created to control it. It has been stated that 5,000 persons will be employed at the head-quarters alone. World trade is suffering to-day, not so much from tariff restrictions, as from the bureaucratic control which manifests itself in such form as import quotas, export licences and currency restrictions. Apart from the difficulties arising out of the relation between hard currencies and soft currencies, world trade has to contend with the pettifogging interference of a host of officials in every country before goods can be moved at all. The channels of world trade are clogged with bureaucrats. Now it is proposed to set up a super-bureaucracy, which will impose its regulations upon the lesser bureaucrats operating in the various countries. Is there any prospect that this agreement will get the world out of its economic difficulties? I do not believe that there is. This attempt will fail, and the nations will revert to the more practical method of entering into bilateral and trilateral agreements. When nations know what they have to sell, and where the best markets are for their goods, they can readily enter into agreements to their mutual advantage. It seems strange that, while we have sent Ministers to Geneva and Havana at great expense, no attempt has been made to bring representatives of the Empire countries together to talk over trade matters and discover how they can best help Britain and the Empire generally, as was done at the last Ottawa conference. I content myself with mentioning one phase of the Ottawa Agreement which affected tens of thousands of people in Australia, and had a marked effect on our economy. Before the agreement was reached, a fat lamb of reasonable size was sold in Australia for about 9s.; immediately afterwards the price jumped to 15s. We all are familiar with the effect of the agreement on Australia's meat industry, and let us never forget that Australia's main crop is not wheat but grass. The Ottawa Agreement brought about an increase of prices and raised living standards in Britain, Canada and Australia, and thus contributed to the recovery from the depression of those countries, and the world generally. I cite one instance. Our principal imports from the United States of America were petrol and motor cars. In the depth of the depression we imported only 4,000 motor cars in the year, a great number of which came from the United States of America. Then, because of the improvement of our living standards, mainly as the result of the Ottawa Agreement, we imported in a few years time about our normal quota of 60,000 to 70,000 cars. Our imports of other commodities increased correspondingly. That is an example of how action taken to improve the economy of Empire countries results in improving the economy of other countries as well. When two countries enter a trade agreement, which benefits them, the benefit extends to other nations. I am sure' that the making of bilateral or trilateral agreements will be found to be the surest and safest way of restoring world trade. In the meantime, we are wasting time and money by sending Ministers overseas, and by producing trade documents so complicated as to baffle the keenest legal minds; yet no attempt is made to bring representatives of the Empire countries together in an attempt to reach an understanding that will benefit the Empire and the world generally. It is clear from the agreement before us that Empire- preference is to be, in part at any rate, eliminated. Trade leaders in the. United States of America have never made any secret of the fact that that is their objective. I do not believe that the elimination of Empire preference will benefit the world, and it will certainly be to the disadvantage of Australia, because the United Kingdom is still our principal market. I cannot envisage Great Britain ever recovering the economic status which it possessed before the war. Great Britain's wealth was made largely during the industrial revolution, when it manufactured goods and sold them to the rest of the world. In this way, its established credits were invested all over the world, and the standard of living of the people of Britain depended upon the income from those investments. I cannot see Britain ever reestablishing overseas investments of that kind. Great Britain has never been physically a very rich nation. It is rich in coal certainly, but the miners will not work properly. The country is rich in ideas and business initiative, but those qualities are being repressed by a socialist government. I cannot see that post-war Britain will ever regain its prewar greatness. Many of its securities have been sold. Its dollar securities in Argentina were sold only a few days ago. It can no longer feed' its people. But all of this does not mean that the Empire has lost its glamour and glory. A new and reconstructed Empire will evolve with power and wealth more evenly distri but ed between the Old Country and the Dominions. If there be one bright spot in Empire relations it is the change that has taken place since pre-war days in the overseas investment of British capital. Before the war there was quite a flow of British capital to the Continent; now, British capital is flowing to the dominions. Is it not time, then, for us to begin thinking about this newly reconstructed Empire? If we are able rapidly to reconstruct and develop Empire trade, we shall find that it will be of - benefit not only to us, but also, to the peoples of the world. We have already had the lesson of Ottawa. That lesson must be repeated. Anything that weakens Empire ties and any nebulous movement of trade relations between the countries of the world must fail ultimately because of the practical realities of the situation. We shall ascertain in a few months whether the Havana conference has been successful. If, as I am led to believe, some countries are already planning to withdraw from these agreements, and if, as has been said, the United States is insisting on multilateral agreements with non-discriminatory clauses, any attempt to make a worth-while world trade agreement must fail. I shall leave any further remarks along these lines to a. later date and until we shall have had the benefit of listening to the speech of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman) on this subject.
