The honorable member for Swan last night dealt pretty fully with the question of the Northern Territory; and I think that he and all other honorable members will agree that a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, right through the centre of Australia, is absolutely necessary to the development of the country. There could be feeding lines established, principally into Western Australia, through some of the best unpeopled country on the face of the earth. The retarding of progress in this portion of the continent is a blot on our history; and a railway of the kind would be of immense advantage, and should be proceeded with at once. South Australia held the Northern Territory for many years, and I am pleased to hear honorable members give credit to that State for what it did in this connexion. There were many nations who would have been very pleased to own the Northern Territory; but the handful of people in South Australia retained it within their grasp, and handed it over to the Commonwealth, with a view to its proper development. It is idle to suggest that the Territory is not good country. We are in possession of reliable reports that land in the Macdonnell  Ranges and Barklay Tablelands would carry 20,000,000 sheep, and that there are 80,000,000 acres of the best wheatgrowing country in the world, with a rainfall of 16 inches. All that is required is a railway to properly open up these tracts of land to the proper stamp of settlers. I am confident that the sons of our grand old pioneers would be pleased to take over and stock country of the kind ; but, of course, there must be proper means of communication. I suggest that all the information available in regard to this portion of Australia, from a settlement point of view, should be published in a small book for the information of honorable members and others who are interested. You, Mr. Chairman, have a motion on the noticepaper to establish a Government horsebreeding station in Australia, and I can only say that no better country than that in the Northern Territory could he found for such a purpose. Iu the time of peace, which we hope will soon be here, a great military station might be established in the Northern Territory, with provision for horsebreeding and the training of men, which, of. course, will have to continue. In the Northern Territory we have a great country with a congenial climate and a splendid rainfall, and yet we hear honorable members and others speaking as though it was the poorest and most miserable land on the face of the earth. Poor country can be found anywhere, but we must remember that country of inferior class in Canada has been satisfactorily developed by means of railways. We cannot expect people to invest their money in a country which is described as the Northern Territory sometimes is; and I am afraid that that part of Australia is prejudiced by the utterances of men who cannot have even read the reports regarding it. There have been many reports, and the last was that given by Mr. David Lindsay. The request made to Mr. Lindsay was a unique one in the history of Parliaments. He was asked to address the honorable members of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament in the House itself on the subject of the Northern Territory, and he received the thanks of both for the information he then supplied. The Northern Territory can only he properly developed by continuity of policy. The exMinister of External Affairs took a great interest in the subject; and I must not be understood as here implying that the present Minister is not doing his level best for the country. In my opinion, the policy adopted by the exMinister was on the right track, but, as I say, it is impossible for any proper development to take place without continuity of policy. There ought to be a Board of Advice of, say, three men who are perfectly familiar with the country and its requirements, to advise the Minister and the Department. I do not say that Professor Gilruth is not a very good man for his position, but he is not conversant with Central Australia, and never has been. The right honorable member for Swan carried out his explorations in a proper way, and his reports are well worth reading. Professor Gilruths opinion concerning the Northern Territory, to my mind, is worth very little. The Northern Territory is a great country, and we should do our best to develop it. It is a magnificent country for the raising of horses and cattle, while millions of sheep may also be depastured there. I should like the Minister of External Affairs to carefully consider what he should do to develop the Territory. I know that he has ideas of his own concerning the matter, but one suggestion that I would make to him is that he should enter upon a vigorous policy of railway construction. As Sir George Reid once pointed out, development rapidly follows the pushing out of our railway systems. I had the honour of meeting Lord Kitchener when I was in the Old Country a little while ago, and he expressed to me his delight that the Commonwealth Parliament proposed to construct a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. This is by no means a party question. I was sorry to hear the right honorable member for Swan last night refer to the honorable member for Grey as being  oneeyed  in regard to the northsouth railway. The honorable member for Grey has always been a broadminded man, and has from the first supported the construction of the eastwest railway. Neither he nor I desires any political movement for our own personal benefit, and we have never advocated anything of the kind. A Federal Bureau of Agriculture would assist materially in the development of the Northern Territory, since it would be able to give settlers much valuable information regarding the class of crops that can be most profitably raised on different areas. Many years ago a ship from South Africa was lost on the south coast of South Australia, and a quantity of seeds on board were washed ashore. These were ultimately scattered on the sand hummocks, with the result that a luxuriant growth of grass sprang up,, and bound the sand together. This grass has since proved of great benefit to the people. The Northern Territory can be made a magnificent national asset if we develop it along the right lines. It is a beautiful country, needing only the attention of pioneers. We want to settle there a body of men like the grand old pioneers who did so much to develop Australia. Let them take up the land and stock it. That is a work which can be better done by our own young men than by the people of any other race. All that they need is the assistance of a few thousand people from outside. If they be given a chance they will quickly show that they have the pioneering blood of their forefathers, and, granted proper facilities in the way of railway communication, they will rapidly develop this magnificent Territory.","Department of External Affairs","ESTIMATES, 191415","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There are some sixteen or seventeen hotels in the Territory, and the Minister has decided that the Commonwealth shall take charge of ten of them. The reason given for this action is that the men up there have been served with frightfully bad grog, which lias been described as   chain lightning. The Minister is so convinced of the devastating results of this bad grog that he is going to take over ten of the hotels, leaving the remaining six or seven to continue to sell liquor of this particular character. The honorable gentleman maj be carrying out a rather cherished principle of his own, but I am satisfied that it will not be conducive to the results he is anxious to obtain. I am entirely with him in his desire to curtail the operations of hotels in the Northern Territory, and particularly to prevent them from supplying the men with an adulterated and destroying article. But it is not a very enticing prospect that the Commonwealth coat of arms may now be painted over the doors of liquor saloons. This great democratic nation of the southern seas has decided that one of the grand things it can do to develop the Northern Territory, and to fill up its empty spaces, is to enter upon the sale of grog. I suppose that a short time hence we may be edified by hearing of the Hotel Fisher in the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister, being himself a teetotaller, will hardly consider it an honour to have his name associated even with the Government sale of grog. We shall probably hear also of  Pearces Pub., although the Minister of Defence is likewise a total abstainer. Then we may have such hotels as Archibalds Inn;  Spences Saloon: Only members of Australian Workers Union supplied. And the walls of these hotels, may probably be decorated with such advertisements as  Mahons Pure Beer; Gardiners Gin: Guaranteed Good; Russells Rum: Absolutely Reliable. There are ten Ministers, and I presume that the ten hotels will be called after them, as an indication of what a progressive Government may do for the future welfare of the people and their use of grog. The Ministers action to me is most reprehensible.

There is more slygrog selling in Melbourne than in any prohibition town. As a matter of fact, where licences exist, slygrog selling is encouraged. The liquor trade is the most lawbreaking and vicious in the country. It violates the law at every opportunity, and breaks it at every turn; it defies the law and laughs at law makers has nothing but contempt for them.

This system of State hotels in Western Australia has not reduced drunkenness nor affected the increased drinking of the people of the State, whose consumption per head of the population is nearly double that of any other State. Not only is this a fact, but the State hotels in Western Australia, just as is the case with State hotels in any other country, are centres of drinking of a very insidious character, more so than in the case of other hotels. I was in Great Britain some years ago when the municipalization idea was strongly in evidence, when Earl Grey commenced his agitation in regard to the public house trust system, by which profits from hotels were to be devoted to the encouragement of temperance societies and the provision of bowling greens and libraries, and the managers of the hotels were not to be given any interest in the sales of liquor, their sole profits outside their salaries being derived from the sale of temperance beverages, and where at all times, night or day, temperance beverages were to be obtainable by those requiring them. On paper it would seem that this system was to be a very fine thing. The churches blessed it. Ministers of the gospel consecrated hotels in some cases. Yet, as a matter of fact, we know that these hotels, by reason of their respectability, are a more insidious temptation to the public.

The Northern Territory seems to be cropping up as a hardy annual in our debates, but I was on the tiptoe of expectation when the honorable member for Brisbane rose that he was about to settle the whole question, because he took to task categorically all Ministers who have ever had this problem in hand, passed them all out as of no consequence, referred to some as probable triers, and then left the present Minister to justify himself. The honorable member said that he had a policy for the Northern Territory, but he devoted the whole of his remarks to the liquor question. Any sane man who has the welfare of the Northern Territory at heart, knows that the manner of regulating the liquor traffic is not going to settle the great problem of developing the Territory, and I shall not delay further on that subject beyond saying that it is a surprise to see a member of the Labour party trying to show that the general policy of his party, namely, the nationalization of the liquor traffic, is a false one. However, it is for the honorable member to justify that attitude to his party. The development of the Northern Territory proved a proposition too big for South Australia, although that State pluckily, and by the expenditure of a considerable amount of money, endeavoured to do its best for the immense area that was committed to its charge. The Commonwealth took over the Territory, which today provides evidence of the fact that, while Australia may be regarded as one of the most prosperous colonies of the British Empire, we have signally failed to effectively handle the question of that countrys colonization. I think the Minister is entitled to the respect of this House for the candour with which he faced the question. Unlike previous Ministers, who thought they had a policy which would determine the matter, he said that, although he had given the matter careful consideration, he was unable, after an experience of a few months, to say where the people to settle the Territory were coming from.

It is not yet proven to the satisfaction of Australia that the white child will prosper in the Northern Territory as well as in other parts of Australia. The home life is a consideration which will be found to influence very largely the policy of getting bond fide permanent settlers for the Northern Territory. The Minister very properly has said that the class of transitory settlers who go to the Territory with the idea of making money quickly, and departing again, is not going to lead to bond fide settlement. Bond fide settlement requires that the white man shall be willing to bring his white partner with him, and be assured of the possibility of rearing his children.

A big expenditure in improving the conditions will be necessary. There are a few outstanding features that have proved themselves in connexion with land settlement in other parts of Australia, and they must have an important bearing on any policy of settlement in the Northern Territory. First of all, it is essential that there shall be rapid and effective trans port. The question of whether the means of access shall be by way of the northsouth railway, as suggested by the honorable member for Grey, or along the route suggested by the right honorable member for Swan, is a matter that will have to be determined. For the present my mind is open on the question ; what » ever route will best suit the Territory, and most quickly develop it, and at the same time not put this Parliament in the position of abrogating any bargain that has been made, I will support. But if any policy means that an honorable bargain made at the time of Federation is to be repudiated* I will not be a party to it. It has struck me that in order to make the Territory something of a success the lines that have been followed in the past are not those to be pursued in the future. I rather favour the appointment of a permanent Commission to accomplish what the honorable member for Barker indicated as necessary, namely, a continuous policy. Changes of Ministries bring, about changes in ideas as to the policy of land settlement. We have had the attempt at the cabbage garden method of developing the Territory, and that has proved to be a failure. Today the Territory is saddled with a debt of £6,000,000, which is a pretty big handicap foi any Ministry or any permanent Commission to face, and at the same time make a success of the Territory. One essential to the success of any territory is that it shall proceed along the lines, of selfsupport. I would suggest that .the present debt of the Northern Territory, other than the debt on the railway system, be funded, and the Territory relieved of it; that a permanent Commission be appointed with power to borrow money from abroad or internally for the development of the Territory; that the money so borrowed be earmarked for the Territory alone; and that, as far as possible, the burden of developing the Territory be removed from the ordinary taxpayer. In every distract in the Commonwealth there are good propositions available to every young Australian. I do not know of one district in the whole of Australia that may be said to be adequately and fully developed. While we have these propositions around the coast of Australia, good land, good opportunities, and other attractions, we will not get people to take the risk of going to the Territory unless, first of all, they are convinced that in the north is undoubtedly a proposition not available in the other parts of Australia. Why I suggest that the development of the Territory should not be a burden on the ordinary taxpayers is this: Within my own constituency there are districts which have been settled for fifty years, and are still without a railway. Am I to ask the taxpayers in that district to find money for building railways in the Northern Territory when they are unable to get money from the Government to build railways, establish water schemes, and other works which would increase the productivity of their own land ? Today Australia has far too small a population for the development of those areas which already have been long settled. Therefore, I would make the development of the Territory a separate policy and a separate State under a permanent Commission. That Commission should be composed of hardheaded men, who have seen something of the developmental life of this country, and dealt with similar country in, say, Queensland and Western Australia, men of proven capacity and financial ability and experience; I would exclude politicians. I would give the Commissioners power to roam the world, in order to find population to settle in the Territory. No Minister of the Crown will be able, alone, to decide altogether what is good for the development of the Territory, and how population may be got there. Whatever policy we adopt must be continuous. How can we in the National Parliament, 1,500 miles from the Territory, know the conditions that will best suit the development of that country ? Irrigation may be possible in certain directions. My opinion is that it will be found that most of the land in that Territory is already waterlogged.  An Honorable Member. Not all of it. They have 6 inches of rainfall in certain places, and it is away in a few hours. I have it from those who have been up there, who have seen, that some parts of the country are waterlogged.","Department of External Affairs","ESTIMATES, 191415","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Where would the settlement of Victoria, or, indeed, the settlement of Australia, have been had it not been for the early discoveries of mineral wealth ?

I think that Australia is likely to benefit considerably by the high prices of beef and mutton in the rest of the world. The Minister knows as well as anybody else that Australias progress must depend upon the value of her export trade, and it is the export of primary production, chiefly wool, beef and mutton, that will best help us to adjust our balances on the other side of the world, which is being rapidly transformed into workshops. I regret that there has been a steady depletion of the herds and flocks in this country during the past dry year. Probably no honorable member of this House can conceive what the internal loss to the Commonwealth has been. I take no notice of the fact that in odd places there may have been increased prosperity. That kind of prosperity is not calculated to increase the national wealth. The misfortune of the man in the north may increase the prosperity of the man in the south, whose fodder has gone up to £12 a ton, but I personally say that I regret to have to sit in any Parliament of this country and watch the stock die by a process of exhaustion., while other people enrich themselves by charging as much as £12 a ton for fodder. I saw an example the other day of a man in my own district, a sharefarmer who contracts on the road during the rest of the year. He told me this tale. It had been his third trip into the town to obtain fodder. Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead. He was the father of a family of eleven. He said: This is my third trip to get fodder today; the price is £12 5s. If I go back without fodder this time I go back with a doublebarrelled gun to shoot my eight horses.

Of all the great questions brought before this Parliament, the settlement and development of the Northern Territory is the greatest. We should have much sympathy with the Minister who is charged with the administration of the affairs of the Territory. As a Labour member, I feel that this question should not be merely one of Ministerial policy, but that it should be one of national policy, to be preached from one end of Australia to the other, to gain the cooperation of the people as a whole in bringing it into effect. At this particular juncture the eyes of .the people are raised to a wider horizon than ever before. It was asked by a member some time ago whether he could be expected to advise the people of his district, who needed water conservation works and the making of railways for the development of their land, to vote money to build a national railway which would not directly affect them. These people, however, show no hesitation at the present time in mortgaging the resources of the country to provide means with which to fight a foe that is recognised to be the foe of Australia as well as of the countries of Europe to which it is in opposition. We recognise that the security of the Empire depends on the action that we may take in this crisis. It has been preached by the broadestminded men in Australia, however, that unless we successfully solve the Northern Territory question, this great continent will eventually he lost to the white race, no matter what development may take place in its more favoured States. We are debating, not a provincial matter, but a question relating to the welfare of every person in the Commonwealth, and affecting the security of the British Dominions as a whole. I have no wish to take sides on the question whether the railway should be built east or west, but I have been so impressed by my study of the subject, although I have no personal acquaintance with the Territory, that I am convinced that no sacrifice will be too great for the people of Australia to make which would bring about the realization of our duties in this matter. The support of the people was given to the Labour party so lavishly at the last election that we should endeavour to give effect in a broad way to the initial stages of a policy which aims at realizing the greater destinies of this continent. I could point to scores of good agricultural districts in New South Wales which need railways, but, nevertheless, I say, let us be taxed to build a national railway from the north to the south of the continent. The construction of such a line is the first step that must be taken towards the solution of the problem which confronts us, and it will secure, not merely the Imperial interest, but also the local interests of the States. But to construct a railway without at the same time putting into effect a progressive land policy, based on the ideals of the Labour party, and not on the failures of the past, would be useless. Our land policy must be entirely different from that which has operated so unhappily in the States. Perhaps I come into this debate not too well equipped, but I have had experience as a worker on the land extending over twentyfive or twentysix years, and know the hardships which the man on the lane! has to face, and I have also been engaged for eight or nine years in assisting in the administration of State laws, and, therefore, I know something of the defects of our laws, and have sympathy with the difficulties of our settlers. I shall endeavour to lay down briefly a few of the principles at which I have arrived as the result of an honest endeavour to understand the question on which I am speaking. Without the institution of a wise system of land settlement, we shall have to tell, in regard to the Northern Territory, only a tale of slow progress, and the success of our efforts at development will seem hopeless. A number of honorable members here are opposed to what they term Socialism, but I say that if we wait until men with capital, large or small, go to the Northern Territory, we shall wait in vain for its development. One honorable member has recommended the offering of grants of land, and the Leader of the Opposition, in his policy speech, recommended the adoption of the freehold principle. He would allow a reasonable living area, not exceeding 2,560 acres, to be granted in freehold. He has stated that he regards that as necessary for the development of the Territory. Before stating the principles at which I have arrived, I wish to show what the freehold system has done for the settled States, and particularly for New South Wales, with whose conditions I am most conversant. No doubt, Sir John Robertson, when framing his Free Selection Act, considered that sufficient safeguards had been provided. Free selection was the first step towards the acquirement of freehold, and is so still in most of the States. There have been countless amendments of the land laws of New South Wales; men of varying degrees of intelligence and honesty having thus endeavoured to safeguard the interests of future settlers by preventing land monopoly, and to establish a prosperous peasantry on the soil. Yet, in 1887, it was possible for the late Sir William Lyne, by a question addressed to a Minister in the Legislative Assembly, to elicit the information that, although 230,000 selections had been taken up in the State to date, only 28,000 of the original selectors remained on their blocks, so fast was the aggregation of large estates proceeding. Our party has proposed an expedient which it considers the true corrective of this evil. Although I support it, I regard it only as an expedient, which will ultimately be supplanted by a higher and truer system, under which the principles of broad justice, which have been outraged under the State systems, will receive recognition. Notwithstanding the direct opposition of the Liberal party of New South Wales to the leasehold policy of the Labour party embodied in the Act of 1912, an Act which the Liberals passed in 1908 contains so many safeguards against the. evils arising from freehold, that one of the most distinguished supporters of the Liberal Government Dr. McLaurin, a member of the Upper House said that it gave only an illegitimate kind of freehold. The Act of 1908 provides that, even after a selector has paid the whole of the capital value of his land, and a deed of grant has been issued to him, he may transfer only with the sanction of the Minister, and a transfer to a person holding in the district more than a living area, counting the area applied for, cannot be sanctioned. Thus the real essence of freehold is eliminated, and, except for differences which I shall define, the tenure under the Act of 1908 is similar to the perpetual leasehold system provided for in the Act of 1912. If the Labour party were willing to drop the condition of perpetual residence and periodical reappraisement, its tenure would be almost the same as that given by the Liberal party in the Act of 1908. I hope that the system of freehold will not be perpetuated by the Commonwealth, and that we shall profit by the mistakes of the States. I shall show how the Act of 1908, which provides for a tenure from which the essence of freehold is removed, has failed in the object which its framers had in view the prevention of land monopoly. As a practical man, who has had large experience, and has listened for weeks at a stretch to evidence with regard to what is a living area, I say that the meaning of  living area  must constantly change. If a man is within a decent rainfall, and the land is good, doubtless, before railway facilities come, it is necessary to have a sufficient area to make a living by grazing. And even when a railway does come, agriculture in the beginning is carried on by slipshod methods, and we are in a great measure now suffering from the careless, improvident system adopted in the past. However, all this is being gradually altered. The development of inventive genius, of agricultural chemistry, and so forth, not to speak of new markets, is tending to make one mans labour more effective than it was in the past; and we have the phenomenon that land, which, twentyfive years ago, was scarcely able to keep its owner out of debt, can now keep, perhaps, four or five families in a state of wellbeing and prosperity. I admit that the leasehold system is subject to similar disabilities; and the leasehold system I re gard as merely an instalment or step towards a better one. In the case of leaseholds, however, it is recognised that the land belongs to the State, and there is a clumsy method of reappraisement in order that there may be returned some of the enhanced value brought about, in a great measure, by the advantages afforded by the State. It is possible that the freehold areas of 2,560 acres spoken of may in the future be the sites of cities with teeming population.

A careless and improvident man may start a distributing or manufacturing business at one corner of the street, and later be met with the competition of an uptodate man in a similar business at the other corner, with the inevitable result of the ruin of the business of the careless or weaker competitor. But that does not. apply in the case of land. A man may own 1,000 acres, and use it merely for raising a few illbred sheep, and for the careless and perfunctory cultivation of 100 or 200 acres, making as a result, perhaps, £200 or £300 a year, and managing to pay the interest on the mortgage. Another piece of land of exactly the same quality and area in the neighbourhood may be purchased by a capable, uptodate agriculturist, and put to its utmost uses, as I have seen done in New South Wales by settlers from Victoria and South Australia. Better stock is introduced along with modern methods, and an income, not of £200 or £300, but possibly of £1,200 or £1,500, is secured as a return. But does this capable competition ruin the incapable and careless neighbour? Not at all, for the effect has been merely to demonstrate that the land of the incapable man is worth not, say, £2 an acre, but £6 or £7 an acre; and he is enabled to sell out at the higher figure and become what he could not have hoped to become by his own exertions a prosperous man. Every person in the community is paying something into a deposit on which the cheques of only some particular persons will be honoured later on. I regard land taxation as only an expedient begotten of the necessity to deal with most unjust and monstrous conditions. Census returns in New South Wales show that ten districts in the rain zone, and well calculated to support large numbers of people, have lost population during the last ten years; and this means that our cities are becoming more swollen than ever with what may be described as an artificial population. We have at this time, in the case of the Northern Territory, the finest opportunity to show the world that the principles of0 justice and equity can be firmly established and maintained, when, as it were, we are relieved from the trammels of the older systems under which monopoly was fostered, perhaps unwittingly, by men to whom we handed the care of the community.

Doubtless it would suit people who have aggregated large estates, to keep the bulk of the productive energy of the country cap in hand under some system of tenancy or of share farming, of which I am an opponent, but which I am compelled myself to use. As a practical man I warn the Commonwealth of the danger of allowing the thin edge of the wedge that is, allowing freehold tenure side by side with leasehold in the Northern Territory. Human beings, of course, always tend along the line of least resistance, and make for the highest profits.

I wish to bring before the Committee a matter relating to the meat works that are being erected in the Northern Territory by Messrs. Vestey Brothers. The honorable member for Wannon complained bitterly this morning of cattle being driven back to the more sparsely settled portions of Australia. We admit that they are being rapidly driven back, but Australian consumers of meat are not likely to benefit much by the cattle we have there at present. I was very anxious that the Federal Government should retain large areas in the Northern Territory for the breeding of cattle in sufficient numbers to supply the people of Australia with meat. We have been warned against the Australian Beef Trust, which is buying meat from every available meat works in the Commonwealth. We also have Vestey Brothers carrying on operations here. That firm is an extensive one, with its headquarters in London, and we cannot say whether or not it is associated with the American Beef Trust. It is financially very strong, and is building extensive works in the Northern Territory. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will take over those works in the near future if it has the power to do so. Messrs. Vestey Brothers have purchased four of the best stations in the Northern Territory, together with about 240,000 head of cattle. We know that these people are practically going to control the whole of the output of meat and cattle from the Northern Territory. Australia at present, with the exception of the State of Queensland, is not raising sufficient cattle to feed her own people. As a matter of fact, the beef now being raised in Queensland is of very little use to the people of Australia. Many of us are of opinion that action should be taken to control these large concerns. The Constitution is very weak in many respects, but we are sufficiently powerful to bring forward legislation that will effectively control the Meat Trust as we know it in Australia. Mr. Justice Street, who was appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the operations of the Beef Trust, reported that it is operating, in Australia as well as in America and in England : that Swift and Company, Armour and Company, and Morris and Company were acting in combination in the United States of America and England, with the object of fixing the prices of livestock, and that they were also operating in conjunction in the retail markets of those countries. I put certain questions in the House this morning with the object of showing honorable members what these firms exercise in other parts of the world, and what they will exercise in Australia if the opportunity is afforded them. The Commonwealth Government would be acting in the best interests of the people if it imposed an export duty on all meat over and above a certain quantity slaughtered at any works. In that way alone can we hope to control the operations of these people.  The Government, I understand, are prepared to give reasonable consideration to this question, recognising that the price of stock is very high, and will be much higher in the near future. The retail price of meat is steadily rising all over the Commonwealth, and more particularly in the State in which the largest number of beasts is slaughtered. In the northern parts of Queensland meat is probably dearer than in any other part of Australia. Nothing has been done, and, pending an amendment of the Constitution, probably nothing can be done, save in the direction I have mentioned, to prevent a still further increase in prices. Until quite recently the Northern Territory supplied the Queensland market with many head of cattle, but that source of supply has now ceased. Stock raised in the Territory is being sent to the new works. With the arrival of the Beef Trust in Australia, cattle were slaughtered on a most extensive scale, and the price of cattle increased to such an extent that, prior to the outbreak of the war, many of the meat works were fast approaching a point at which they would have been Forced to suspend operations. During the last six or eight months, the meat works in Queensland have been slaughtering on a scale more extensive than was ever known before.","Department of External Affairs","ESTIMATES, 191415","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was also stated that they had been purchasing the whole of the output of Mr. Rosewarnes works at Brisbane, John Cooke and Company, Baynes Brothers, the Queensland Meat Export Companys works at Brisbane, at Ross River, and at Lakes Creek.

Mr. Justice Street found that these firms were practically controlling the whole of the meat trade in Australia, and it is reasonable, therefore, to ask the Government to take whatever action is open to them, in order to cope with the difficulty. Messrs. Morris and Company have, so far, not done very much business in Australia, but they intend in the very near future to operate upon an extensive scale. They have purchased land on the Brisbane River, and are about to enter upon the erection of works.

179,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SHARPE, James","KR8","N/A","N/A","N/A",2619,"Tracing these transactions is a very difficult matter ; but I hold the opinion that those who originated the idea were the people who have lately come to Australia. On page 31 of the report of the Commissioner, we have the evidence of Mr. Sims, whose association with Swift and Company sufficiently convinces me that Swift and Company and Sims and Cooper, of Geelong, are financially connected in some way. The rapid growth of the business of Sims and Cooper during the last couple of years, and the fact that they could not have made such a profit out of their business as would enable them to extend their works as they have done, give additional proof. The Royal Commissioner says  The fact that, as Mr. Sims says, a great proportion of the output of his firm has gone to Swift and Company may have led to a misconstruction of the business relations between the two firms, and may have led to an inference being drawn of a closer relationship than in fact exists. Sims and Cooper are selling their output to these people. Some influence must be behind them, assisting them in some way, and enabling them to compete in the market to a greater extent than can older established big financial firms in Victoria. They will soon get control of the trade here by paying a price for stock no other meat works in Victoria can pay, and thus drive other people out. They are large buyers of stock in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria; and when we know that they are able to operate so successfully, and that their London office is merely a branch office, we can only conclude that their works are influenced in some way I do not say exactly controlled by Swift and Company. At any rate the influence of Swift and Company over Sims and Cooper ia sufficient to prove that they are associated with the business of the firm in every way. A paragraph on page 32 of the Commissioners report dealing with the advantage of control over Australian supplies says : The suppression of competition and the control over supplies is not only a matter of serious concern to Australia, but it is also a matter of Imperial concern. It is improbable that the American companies have any intention of engaging in the distributing trade in Australia. Their object in coming here is to obtain supplies for their trade in the United Kingdom, and in the United States, and, assuming the existence of a desire to exercise a determining influence on prices in the markets of the United Kingdom, the advantage of a control over Australian supplies is obvious. Then further on, on the next page, the Commissioner says: If facilities and opportunities for effective combination exist it is not improbable that they may be made use of. In his recent report Mr. Cherry says that in the United States it is fairly evident that the representatives of Armour and Company, Swift and Company, and Morris and Company, have at least a mutual understanding as to prices. Mr. Cabburn is of opinion that the American companies already fix the price of meat in all the markets of the United Kingdom. When we know that, and when in . his summary the Royal Commissioner, after collecting evidence in four States of the Commonwealth, shows that he is absolutely satisfied that Armour and Company, Swift and Company, and Morris and Company constitute the American Beef Trust, and are operating in America both in live stock and dead meat as regards prices, and are in a position to arrange and fix prices on the London market, we must have some fear that the same thing will occur in Australia in the very near future. This morning I was not permitted to conclude a paragraph on which I wished to base a question to the Minister of Trade and Customs. I take this opportunity of doing so for the information of honorable members who are not prepared to believe that! the American Beef Trust is in our midst at the present time.

In the last Parliament, the honorable member was continually hammering into the then Government his contention that if something were not done to check the operations of the Beef Trust in Australia the whole meat trade would be ruined. Now the honorable member has a Government from his own party in power, and the best thing he can do is to convince them of his view when they are sitting in caucus upstairs. The honorable member has an opportunity of ramming this peril into the ears of the Government in the party room, and giving us a little peace in this chamber. Let him and the Government devise some scheme to save the meat trade of Australia. My principal remarks today will relate to the development of the Northern Territory. I regard this as a matter which should be dealt with by the House as a whole, and not by any one party. The Minister of External Affairs, in replying to the remarks of honorable members, practically told the House that he was new to his position, and was in such a fog that he did not know how to develop the Territory. Let me put this point to the Committee. The present Government have been in power for a considerable time, with the exception of a slight interval when the Cook Government held office, and if it is not possible for them to devise a scheme for the development of the Northern Territory, tl.e best thing we can do is to get rid of it altogether. That is the only sensible course to be followed. If it is to happen that one Minister of External Affairs is to experiment with his pet scheme for the opening up of the Territory, and, when a change of Government happens, the next Minister is to try to upset everything done by his predecessor, we shall make no real progress. It is absolutely necessary that this matter shall be put under the control of some person who will have a permanent policy for the opening up of the Territory on the lines which the people of Australia expect to see adopted. I quite agree that it will be impossible for a new Minister, on coming into power, to shut down works that have already been started, and say that the schemes introduced by his predecessor were to cease. We cannot decide whether such schemes are good or not until they have had a proper trial. Any private business man knows that if he starts an enterprise, and finds after it has been in operation for twelve months, that there has been a little failure, he does not abandon the enterprise. On the contrary, he says, I will give the scheme an opportunity, and see if it is going to do any good. I do not think that schemes like the Batchelor farm and the dairy farm are going to develop the Territory at all, but I quite agree with the present Minister of External Affairs and his predecessor that those schemes are on trial, and that we must wait to see what development results. It would be only foolishness if, after one Minister had started a dairy farm, his successor immediately decided not to allow the experiment to continue. If such a policy as that is to be adopted we might as well throw straight into the fire the money which the first Minister has expended. The main fact we have to look at is that until we get the Northern Territory really developed we have to devise means of getting the produce to market. That is the experience in the development of other parts of Australia. If a country, or a portion of a State, is without railway facilities, it is useless to go there to grow sheep if it is going to cost more to get the wool to market than to grow it; it is of no use growing pigs if it is going to cost more to get the pigs to walk through the mud to the markets than it costs to raise them. Until railway facilities are provided, the pioneer must grow something that will walk out of the country. We have the illustration of experimental woolgrowing in the Territory. Something like 1,000 ewes have been purchased for this experiment, which will be all right if the books are properly kept, so as to show whether, in the event of the price of wool going back to normal, there will be any profit from the enterprise. The honorable member for Grey referred to the Avon Downs station, from which those sheep were purchased. They are very good sheep, and that is about the only sheep station in the Territory. All sorts of propositions have been put before people who have money to invest in the development of Australia. I have seen splendid propositions put forward; any one would think that they are most wonderful undertakings to put money into; the leasehold is to be bought at a cheap price, the sheep gave fine percentages of wool, and in some cases the percentage of lambs was very good. The whole thing looks like a scheme for picking up money. But we have to remember that as soon as the price of wool gets back to normal, although there is a profit today, it is going to cost the whole value of the wool to get it to market ; the proposition becomes no longer payable. Take the case of Avon Downs station. To get the wool down to the river, and thence to the seaboard, costs something like £10 per ton. I do not know what the distance is, but I know that that was the contract price in connexion with that little steamship enterprise which the Commonwealth Government undertook, and which proved a failure. But, having got the wool to the seaboard, the owners had then to bring it to one of the big cities of Australia or ship it to London, and all that carriage was only profitable while wool was bringing the price which it is worth today.

Where the grower has to pay enormous freights to get his produce to market, a policy for the development of the Northern Territory by sheep farming and that sort of thing is not likely to be a success. Many mistakes may be made in the development of any country. Mistakes were made in the development of Australia generally. They were made in Queensland, and we may expect them in the Northern Territory, and we may expect that the people who go there first, like the people who went into central Queensland, will lose money through not understanding the country. We know what happened in Queensland. First of all they tried the ordinary dam system which had been used in the development of other portions of Australia. That was found to be absolutely useless. Then there was the experiment of making an overshot dam, where there was a hole in a creek. When the overshot was running over there was plenty of water in the dam, and this was looked upon as a means of combating drought. But the result was that with the tremendous silt which takes place in that portion of Australia, when a 60ft. dam. was full it contained 20 feet of water and 40 feet of silt. That, like the ordinary dam, was a failure. Then there was the circular dam built up on the banks of a creek. This was supposed to be the best scheme possible, and it was a good scheme up to the point that it would carry on over two years without rain, but the seven years drought came, and at the end of the second year there was not a drop of water left in this dam. These are three schemes for the supply of water that absolutely failed in central Queensland.","Department of External Affairs","ESTIMATES, 191415","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Queensland has had to do away with wooden fencing on account of fires and white ants. I am informed that in the Northern Territory there is very little timber to be got, and people going in for fencing to any extent find that the carriage of wire is a tremendous cost. Then again, I would ask if sheep in the Northern Territory are going to produce anything like a reasonable percentage. Are they going to do better than in central Queensland ? On paper, sheepbreeding sometimes looks a very good proposition, but in central Queensland, with two lambings a year, the average amongst merino sheep is not much more than 45 per cent., putting the rams in twice. Are we going to have the same experience in the Northern Territory? If so, it will be a great drawback to sheepbreeding. I cannot understand this low percentage in Queensland in regard to sheep. Experts will tell you how this kind of thing ought to be improved, but the practical man doing everything that it .is possible for him to do has that experience. In the southern portions of Victoria it is found that merino sheep will remain together in the flock. If they were put into a paddock they would remain there, but in central Queensland they are apt to roam all over the place. People who have properties up there say the only explanation is that the rams cannot find the ewes. If that is the case, the ewes will have to be put into smaller paddocks. That is a workable arrangement in good seasons, but sheep cannot be kept in small paddocks when there is no rainfall. That experiment has been tried, and proved to be a failure also. I want to draw the attention of the Committee to the only way in which I consider it is possible to develop the Northern Territory. I am not going to take any notice of the little dispute which crops up every time this question is mentioned between the members for South Australia and Western Australia. Referring to the railway connexion, the members for South Australia say that the only possible way of developing the Northern Territory is by a railway system running from north to south. The honorable member for Grey states that if we run the railway up along the route of the telegraph line from South Australia we are going to have a backbone to start with. My view is that it would be a backbone without any ribs, and such a railway will not do much by way of development. Western Australia, we are told, only came into the Federation to secure the building of the eastwest railway, while South Australia informs us that it only handed over the Northern Territory conditionally upon the northsouth railway being built. Dealing with the Western Australian railway, the right honorable member for Swan I do not know that any agreement was actually entered into has always told us that it was the price paid for Western Australia coming into Federation. In my opinion and I have always stated it if either of these big railways is to be built, then that to the Northern Territory should be started first. The line from Western Australia should wait, because the Northern Territory is the most serious problem the Commonwealth has to deal with.

That should be the first, but honorable members from South Australia realize that, while an immense expenditure is going on on the eastwest railway at present, they have not much chance of their Northern Territory railway. The Minister of External Affairs informed us that the reason why the northern railway cannot be proceeded with is that the plant is not available, and I gathered from his remarks that as soon as the eastwest railway is finished that plant will be released and can go on to the northern line. I think, therefore, that the only possible way to deal with the Northern Territory at the present time is to connect it with our railway system through Queensland.

We propose to similarly amend our law. This Bill gives the Commonwealth Government the right to take over certain factories, or the goods manufactured in them, for the use of the Defence Department. Before the war broke out, we had had happily no experience in matters of this kind, and our original Act was largely a copy of an Imperial measure. Experience has shown the English legislation to be inadequate, and our experience has been similar. Things for which there was no statutory authority have had to be done by the Government by the exercise of its inherent power to deal with circumstances as they arise in times of war. The Bill concerns chiefly matters of detail, and is intended to fill up gaps which have been found to exist under the operation of the original Act. It makes it clear that offences against the regulations are punishable on summary conviction. It also gives to the Government power to take over any mill or warehouse, or anything contained in them, in order that all necessary equipment may be provided for the carrying of the war to a successful issue. The powers given to the Government by this legislation are very great, but it is absolutely necessary that the Government should have them. We have already practically commandeered the output of every woollen mill of importance in Australia. In justice to the proprietors of these establishments, I wish to say that they have met us in a most honorable and gentlemanly manner, and have not placed any obstacles in the way of our doing the right thing in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth.

But I do not wish to discuss that matter now. If at any other time we are attacked on the subject, we shall know how to meet the attack. I desire to say at once that the manufacturers of Australasia have met the Defence Department in a truly patriotic spirit, and that, I suppose, is because the Government have not taken up any strong attitude in regard to prices, but have given practically those that were asked for. The manufacturers admit that they have been satisfactorily treated by the Department, and that, at the prices paid, they are able to sell us the goods at a certain profit. It was an admirable idea on the part of the Minister of Defence to hold a conference representing the whole of the manufacturers of Australia, and thus to approach and deal with the question in a manner worthy of the occasion. At present the Government have no power to take such steps for the acquisition of supplies, and the object of this Bill is to give them the necessary legal authority. Honorable members may be surprised to learn that we have gone to certain warehouses I am not talking of woollen mills in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and elsewhere, and have practically taken possession of the underwear and other woollen goods off the shelves for the use of our men. Our justification is the necessity occasioned by the war, and I have much pleasure in informing the House that many of the merchants have disposed of those goods to us at the invoiced price, although there is no doubt that, if they had insisted, they could practically have got the prices , ruling in retail establishments. It is my duty, as Assistant Minister, to gratefully acknowledge such patriotic conduct on the part of our merchants, and I do so gladly. It has been stated that even at present the Government have sufficient power to take possession of goods in the way I have described, but it is our desire to make the position absolutely sure by means of this Bill. It is also provided in the measure that civilians who are charged under the War Precautions Act shall have the right to trial in a civil Court a right now nonexistent. It is only some six days ago that we received from the Imperial authorities an intimation that a similar provision had been incorporated in their War Precautions Act, and the AttorneyGeneral, together with the Minister of Defence, then decided to follow the British example.

Suppose, for the sake of argument, that a portion of the German fleet were to get away from the North Sea and attack Australia. Under such conditions the military authorities would need these powers to protect the people of this country. But, as my colleague has stated, they will only be used in very exceptional circumstances. I do not think that I need say much more. The Bill has been introduced for two or three specific purposes.

261,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"COOK, Joseph","F4S","Parramatta","N/A","N/A",2627,". I do not propose to debate this question at any length. This is largely a technical Bill, and, as I understand the general purpose of it to be ameliorative in character, and to provide further opportunities for civilians, who have committed, shall I say, semimilitary offences, to be tried in a civil Court, it appears to me to be a step in the right direction. The wonderful thing of all and it only indicates how completely obsessed with the war were the great minds in the House of Commons was that, with the great ability of the Imperial Government, and the unquestionable literary and legal ability of the Parliament, statesmen allowed these tremendous powers to be placed on the statutebook of Great Britain. Following them here, of course, we did the same thing; even I, with all my legal lore, did not see how tremendous the powers were. However, there is only one point to which I wish to direct the attention of my honorable friends opposite. Every one recognises that war supersedes ordinary rules relating to the trial of individuals, and the relations of civilians in their business, and otherwise. The whole community is completely upset, and requires a readjustment to war conditions. Everything must be made to bend in war time to the supreme purpose of making the State safe. Therefore,  whatever is involved in that has necessarily to be performed by the Parliament, which is charged with a supreme and overmastering duty. As I understand that a whole crop of these  measures is already ripe, and during next week will probably be brought before us, I only want to say that the Government, knowing their own intentions concerning the measures, must take full responsibility for them. Everything will depend upon the administration of the Acts, and for that administration the Government, and only the Government, can take full responsibility. We simply say to them,  Take your Bill; use it wisely, as no doubt you will ; use it, anyhow, in the interests of the country, and for the purpose of securing the safety and the welfare of its people. Extraordinary powers are taken here. For instance, there is a compulsory socialization, for the time being, of all sorts of businesses, and while the Constitution does not give us power to socialize in ordinary circumstances, either we are playing ducks and drakes with the Constitution, or there is in the Constitution some latent and inherent power, as I should imagine, which requires it to be capable of meeting the supreme crises of the nation.

I only want to make one point. In this amending Bill, there is nothing which appears to limit these extraordinary powers and functions to the duration of the war. I know that such a provision is contained in the principal Act, but this amending measure is introducing into the Act so many new provisions which, perhaps, are not relevant in some respects to it, that perhaps, it would be well to state in this measure that the new provisions are to operate only for the duration of the war.

The pain he suffered was excru mating. At last he said, Doctor, I do not understand this foot of mine. It is getting worse, and not better. Will you kindly examine it ? The doctor examined it, and said,  I am sorry, my poor man, to have to tell you that your ankle is broken. This man was treated for a sprained ankle for eight days. If that can happen to men placed as this man was, God help the poor men who are wounded at the front. When Christmas Day came along, and we were eating our turkey and plum pudding, this man was given curried fat for his dinner. He is prepared to make that statement. We read that some of the men had poultry and other good things for their Christmas (inner, but if they had they contributed the money themselves for the purpose, and the men in the hospital could not do that. I can quote the case of the son of a policeman here, who, in a letter, complained of the food he was getting while in the hospital. If this Bill were passed, and I mentioned these facts outside this House, there would be nothing to prevent the military people coming down upon me and arresting me for telling the truth. I hope that the Government will assist me to secure the appointment of a Board for the investigation of these matters, quite apart from the military people. A soldier is supposed to be an exceptionally good man, and I cannot see why he should not have the same right to justice as a man who is not a soldier. My generation of our family is the first for seven generations that has not been represented in the British Army. My father brought us out to Australia so that we should not join the British Army, because of what he and those with whom he associated were subjected to in the Army. I am appealing to the people of Australia to remedy the old order of things. Honorable members have read of the mutinies that have taken place in the British Navy and Army, and we know that they were brought about by the practice followed of treating men as things, and not as human beings at all. Here we are being asked to pass provisions which will enable the military to treat us as people are treated by the military in Prussia. If a man going down a street in Berlin bumps against a soldier and does not immediately crawl upon his stomach in apology to him, the soldier my run his bayonet into him. If a man is sitting at a table in a restaurant, and soldiers come in, and there is no room at the table for them, he has to get up, and let them sit down. We do not want that kind of thing here, but we shall tend to bring it about if we place these extraordinary powers in the hands of the military, authorities.

With the spirit of his remarks I quite agree. It is intolerable and odious in a Democracy that there should be distinctions of class, sex, or status; but military discipline and trial by court martial are inevitable consequences of the militarism imposed upon us by inexorable circumstances. It is notorious that the ideal and basis on which Democracy rests are incompatible with militarism, and where they coexist militarism is a menace to Democracy. But these questions are not now before us. We are discussing now a question relating to the war and the conduct of the war alone. We are not proposing to impose upon any soldiers or sailors or any persons in the Defence Department greater disabilities than those from which they now suffer, whatever these are. Such a proposal as the honorable member has outlined the establishment of a Board capable of trying military and civil causes cannot be introduced in this Bill. The Bill, so far as it touches the matters referred to by the honorable member, deals with two classes of persons traitors, whether of alien or British descent, and persons guilty of such careless or criminal negligence as to imperil the safety of the Commonwealth. Under the Bill all offenders are liable to the same punishment, whether they be civilians, soldiers, or sailors. The only distinction lies in the tribunal which tries them. And this distinction is, I submit, not only justifiable, but necessary. I am not going to say anything in support of courts martial, but shall refer the honorable member to some observations I made when introducing the principal Act, and will ask him to listen carefully to what I say, so that he may know exactly the position in which the soldier, sailor, and civilian in this country, under this law, will stand, and the attitude of the Government on the matter.

That assurance, I submit, is an adequate and full answer to the honorable members objections. It is a positive assurance that all law in this country proceeds from, and is dependent upon, the will of the people as expressed through their representatives and the Government.

356,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","West Sydney","ALP","AttorneyGeneral",2633,"Subsection 6 provides for civil trial in the ordinary way. In regard to that, I wish to repeat, first of all, the positive assurance I gave in introducing the original measure, that this power is only intended to be used in those cases where the position of the Commonwealth stands literally trembling in the balance. It does not refer to an emergency which arises out of any circumstances mentioned by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, but to rank and wholesale treachery, or such an attack on the very vitals of the nation as would render anything less than the sharp sword of martial law impotent to deal with it.  This new subsection 8 affords no more power to the Government than it already has. Every Government has, and must have, power, in a case of extreme urgency, the right to suspend the civil law and substitute martial law. All that this amendment docs is to express this in statutory form. This measure is not, as the honorable member seems to think, aimed at soldiers and sailors, because they, of all people, are the least likely to be guilty of treachery or any act calculated to imperil the safety of the Commonwealth, but is aimed at men who, under cover of British nationality or naturalization, are plotting and contriving to the detriment of the Commonwealth. The powers asked for under this Bill are great, but the circumstances of the nation demand them. As to the manner in which these unusual powers may be used, the experience of the past few months is, I venture to say, a sufficient guide. The War Precautions Act, which was passed some six months ago, gave the Government tremendous power, and let honorable members point to one of those powers which has been abused by us. Let honorable members point to one case in which the Government have abused their great powers under the War Precautions Act. This Bill is necessary, and it is wanted without a days delay. Speaking from my experience of the administration of one part of the emergency laws the Trading with the Enemy Act, which dovetails with the War Precautions Act I say that we have found the powers conferred on us inadequate in many particulars; and we are now brought to a standstill in some most important matters because we lack the power to deal with circumstances that have arisen.","Second Reading","WAR PRECAUTIONS BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

As bitter a wrong can be done a man in respect of the least offence as in respect of the greatest. Under this Bill the Government will use its great powers without regard to persons; the guilty will be punished, but justice will be done to every man. As for the monstrous supposition that because a man happens to be an officer he is thereby removed from all risk of punishment, such a thing merely requires stating to carry its own refutation with it.

This measure was put into the hands of honorable members a short time ago, and we have not had an opportunity to peruse it. The Government are expecting too much in asking the House to swallow a Bill of this character without an opportunity to discuss it. Looking hurriedly through the Bill, I find, on page 2, the words  to prevent the spread of false reports, and the Bill continues to the effect that any man writing in a newspaper what the military authorities consider to be a false report, will be liable to trial by court martial. The House should not allow any Government to get a Bill like this passed in a hurry. Honorable members have a right to go on the public platforms of the country in order to voice their grievances in regard to any action of the naval or military officers, and this may interfere with that right. As the measure now stands, if my honorable friend for Melbourne Ports drew attention from the public platform to the matter referred to yesterday, he would find himself in the hands of the military authorities at once. I am afraid that the Government are in a funk over this matter. One would think that the country was .nil of enemies, when really there are no enemies here. In the Old Country, trading with the enemy is met with a fine of from 5s. to 20s., but here, although we are 12,000 miles away, the Government are trying to get very heavy penalties. I am not prepared to put the liberties of the people in the hands of the military authorities. Now that the Prime Minister has returned to the chamber, I ask him, does he think it fair to try to force this Bill through with less than an hour for discussion? I, for one, if it goes into Committee, will do my best to prevent it from passing until members have had an opportunity of discussing it. Surely the matter is not so urgent as to prevent the Government from allowing it to stand over till Wednesday next. There are several members of the House who want to speak on it.

I wish to ask the Prime Minister when we may expect a report with regard to matters brought before the House yesterday by the honorable member for Bourke. A painful shock was caused to the whole community by the publication of that speech, and the public mind should be relieved as early as possible. Besides the general public, those who are more intimately concerned the members of the Forces themselves desire that the imputations which have been cast upon Australia as a whole should be removed as early as possible.

The public of Australia know that they can trust the honorable gentleman. We refuse to believe that any officer who has committed a theft will not be punished equally with a man of the rank and file. If, in the Australian Citizen Forces, we can eliminate this kind of thing, we shall be advancing civilization in a greater measure than any other nation. It might be that our men have not come under the influence of discipline to the same extent as their fellows in the Mother Country; but I want an authoritative statement from the Leader of the Bouse that whenever crime is proved against an officer he shall not escape while men of the rank and file are punished for a similar offence.","Order of Business War Precautions Bill Rabaul Court Martial","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In answer to the request made by the honorable member for Grampians, and the statement by the honorable member for Melbourne, I desire to say that, immediately the charges were made, I took steps to ascertain the facts. I go further than the honorable member for Melbourne, and say that an officer who offends in the way that has been alleged has committed a crime far . greater, in my opinion, than would have those who serve under him had they been equally guilty. I am not here to give judgment on the matter at present. I am not here to say whether the allegations are true or otherwise, but I do say that the evidence in . the possession of the Department is sufficient to demand that a thorough investigation of the whole proceedings shall he entered upon speedily and determined quickly. This is the position of the Government; and neither eminence in the Public Service of the Commonwealth nor any other influence will deter the Government from sifting this matter to the bottom.
