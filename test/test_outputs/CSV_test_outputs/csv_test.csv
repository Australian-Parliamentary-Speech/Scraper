At the commencement of each Parliament 2 Members shall be appointed by the House, one to be Deputy Speaker and the other to be Second Deputy Speaker. The Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker shall be appointed in the following manner: The Speaker shall ask for nominations and call Members in turn to move, without notice, a motion that a Member be appointed a Deputy Speaker of this House, each motion to be seconded. When there are no further motions the Speaker shall say that the time for motions has expired. If there is only one nomination the Speaker shall, without question put, declare the Member named to have been appointed Deputy Speaker. The position of Second Deputy Speaker shall remain vacant until the commencement of the next Parliament, a vacancy occurs in the office of Deputy Speaker necessitating a ballot for the position, or the House agrees to a motion that a ballot be conducted for the position of Second Deputy Speaker, whichever occurs first. If there are 2 or more nominations, when the time for motions has expired, debate may ensue but it shall be relevant to the election. No Member may speak for more than 5 minutes. At any time during the debate, a motion without notice may be moved by a Minister, and whether any Member is addressing the Chair or not, 'That the question be now put', which question shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. Upon the carrying of the question 'That the question be now put', or upon the cessation of the debate otherwise, the appointment of the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker shall be proceeded with as provided in this standing order. At the conclusion of the debate the bells shall be rung as in a division and the House shall proceed to a ballot. Each Member, other than the Speaker, shall deliver to the Clerk a ballot paper, in writing, containing the name of the nominated Member for whom he or she votes to be appointed the Deputy Speaker. The votes shall be counted by the Clerks at the Table and the Member who has the greatest number of votes shall be the Deputy Speaker and the Member who has the next greatest number of votes shall be the Second Deputy Speaker. If, after any ballot, other than a ballot which takes place in accordance with paragraph ( i ) of this standing order, in which the names of only 2 Members are submitted, there is an equality of votes, the Speaker shall give a casting vote and the Member for whom the Speaker votes shall be the Deputy Speaker and the other Member shall be the Second Deputy Speaker. If, after any ballot in which the names of more than 2 Members are submitted, it is impossible by reason of an equality of votes to determine which Member has the greatest number of votes or which Member has the second greatest number of votes— If there is an equality of votes for 2 Members, the Speaker shall give a casting vote for one of those 2 Members who shall then be declared appointed to the office which the equality of votes had made it impossible to determine; and If there is an equality of votes for more than 2 Members, a special ballot shall take place in which only the names of the Members who received an equal number of votes are submitted. If the equality of votes had made it impossible to determine the Member to be appointed as Deputy Speaker, then the ballot shall be conducted in the same manner as provided in paragraph ( g ) and the Member who receives the greatest number of votes shall be the Deputy Speaker and the Member who receives the next greatest number of votes shall be the Second Deputy Speaker. If the equality of votes had made it impossible to determine only the position of the Second Deputy Speaker, then each Member shall write on the ballot paper the name of the Member for whom he or she votes to be appointed Second Deputy Speaker and the Member receiving the greatest number of votes shall be the Second Deputy Speaker. If, by reason of a continued equality of votes, the special ballot is inconclusive, then, unless a name is withdrawn, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes. When the sitting is resumed, the votes shall be taken again unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. At any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of any subsequent ballot, a Member whose name was submitted in the first ballot may withdraw his or her name and all further proceedings shall take place as if a motion for the appointment of the Member as a Deputy Speaker had not been moved. Duty of Deputy Speaker 13A. The Deputy Speaker shall chair the Main Committee. Duty of Second Deputy Speaker 13B. The Second Deputy Speaker shall assist the Deputy Speaker and, in the absence of the Deputy Speaker, shall act as Deputy Speaker. Absence of Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker Absence of Speaker 14. Whenever the House is informed by the Clerk of the absence of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, or if the Deputy Speaker is also absent the Second Deputy Speaker, shall, subject to any other order of the House, perform the duties of the Speaker, as Acting Speaker, during that absence. Absence of Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker 15. Whenever the House is informed by the Clerk of the absence of the Speaker and both the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker, the Members present, if a quorum, may at once proceed to elect one of their number who shall, subject to any other order of the House, perform the duties of the Speaker during that absence. Otherwise the House stands adjourned to the next sitting day. For the purposes of this standing order, the Clerk shall act as Chair of the House until a Member is elected to perform the duties of the Speaker. Speaker relieved by Deputy Speaker or Second Deputy Speaker 17. The Deputy Speaker or the Second Deputy Speaker shall take the Chair whenever requested to do so by the Speaker during a sitting of the House, without any formal communication to the House. Speaker's panel 18. The Speaker shall nominate at the commencement of every Parliament a panel of not less than 4 Members to assist the Chair pursuant to standing order 19, and may, at any time during the Parliament, nominate additional Members or revoke the nomination of any Member. Duties of Speaker's panel 19. The Speaker or the Deputy Speaker may call on any one of the members of the Speaker's panel to take the Chair as Deputy Speaker. The Deputy Speaker may also call on any one of the members of the Speaker's panel to take the Chair of the Main Committee. After standing order 22 insert the following new standing orders: Vacancies in both offices of Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker 22A. If the offices of Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker become vacant at the same time the House shall appoint 2 Members to be Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker in the same manner as set out in standing order 13. Single vacancy in office of Deputy Speaker or Second Deputy Speaker 22B. When a single vacancy occurs in the office of Deputy Speaker or the office of Second Deputy Speaker the House shall appoint a Member to fill the vacant office in the following manner: A motion shall be moved, without notice, that a Member be appointed Deputy Speaker or Second Deputy Speaker, as the case may be, of this House, which motion shall be seconded. In the case of appointment to the office of Second Deputy Speaker, only a non-government Member may be named in the motion. The Speaker shall then ask if there is any further motion, and if there is not, shall say that the time for motions has expired. No Member may then address the House or move any motion for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office, and the Speaker shall, without question put, declare the Member named in the motion, to have been appointed to the vacant office. If more than one motion for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office is moved and seconded, the Speaker shall, after the second motion, and after each subsequent motion (if any), ask if there is any further motion, and if there is not, shall say that the time for motions has expired. When the time for motions has expired, debate may ensue, but it shall be relevant to the election. No Member may speak for more than 5 minutes. At any time during the debate, a motion without notice may be moved by a Minister rising in his or her place, and whether any Member is addressing the Chair or not, 'That the question be now put', which question shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. Upon the carrying of the question 'That the question be now put', or upon the cessation of the debate otherwise, the appointment of the Member to fill the vacant office shall be proceeded with as provided in this standing order. Before the House proceeds to a ballot the bells shall be rung as in a division. When only 2 motions for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office are moved and seconded, each Member, other than the Speaker, shall deliver to the Clerk a ballot paper in writing, containing the name of the Member named in one or other of the motions for whom he or she votes, and the votes shall be counted by the Clerks at the Table; and the Member who has the greater number of votes shall be appointed to the vacant office. When more than 2 motions for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office are moved and seconded, the votes shall be taken in the same manner, and the Member who has the greatest number of votes shall be appointed to the vacant office, provided he or she has also a majority of the votes of the Members present; but if no Member has such majority, the name of the Member having the smallest number of votes shall be excluded from subsequent ballots, and a fresh ballot shall take place; and this shall be done as often as necessary until one Member has such majority when he or she shall be appointed to the vacant office. If, after any ballot, other than a ballot which takes place in accordance with paragraph ( k ) of this standing order, in which the names of only 2 Members are submitted, there is an equality of votes, the Speaker shall give a casting vote and the Member for whom he or she votes shall be appointed to the vacant office. If, after any ballot in which the names of more than 2 Members are submitted, it is impossible by reason of an equality of votes to determine which name shall be excluded from subsequent ballots— If there is an equality of votes for 2 Members, the Speaker shall give a casting vote and the name of the Member for whom he or she does not vote shall be excluded from subsequent ballots; and If there is an equality of votes for more than 2 Members, a special ballot shall take place at which there shall be submitted only the names of those Members who have received equal votes and in which each Member shall write on the ballot paper only the names of the Members he or she wishes to retain. The name of the Member who receives the smallest number of votes shall be excluded from subsequent ballots. If, by reason of a continued equality of votes, the special ballot is inconclusive, then, unless a name is withdrawn, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes. When the sitting is resumed, the votes shall be taken again unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. At any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of any subsequent ballot, a Member whose name was submitted in the first ballot may withdraw his or her name and all further proceedings shall take place as if a motion for the appointment of the Member had not been moved. Whenever a withdrawal leaves only one Member in respect of whom a motion for appointment to the vacant office is before the House, that Member shall be declared to have been appointed. Standing order 28B (general purpose standing committees): At the end of paragraph ( c ) add: 'Provided further that, for the purpose of consideration of a bill referred to a committee pursuant to standing order 217A, one or more members of the committee may be replaced by other Members nominated in accordance with the provisions set out in this paragraph. The provisions for the committee to be supplemented by up to 3 members are not affected by this proviso.'
