I am glad that the Government is going to develop that territory. In going there, I made provision against my probable non-return, but the country exceeded the expectations of all of us. We were delighted with its possibilities. My only regret is that the British Government, in its shortsightedness, allowed Germany and Holland to share the island with us. It is pleasing to contrast the administration of Papua by Australia with that of the New Hebrides under the condominium of Great Britain and France. In Papua the natives are fairly dealt with, but in the New  Hebrides they can be tortured, robbed, and murdered practically without redress.

Bill as presented. I may say ' that, as a new member, I have been absolutely disgusted with the way in which honorable members have deliberately wasted the time of Parliament since we started our sittings. According to the Governor-General's Speech we were sent here to deal with matters of great moment to the country, yet we now find ourselves, after a fortnight, just where we started. A censure motion, submitted by the Opposition, occupied us for a week. We then started to try to get something done; but the Country party, in their desire to carry on the affairs of the country, have decided to hold up Supply still longer. It is absolutely necessary that the Government should get the Supply Bill passed. We do not want to go over past history, and criticise what the Government did during the last Parliament. Opposition members surely gave enough of that during the election campaign. I certainly heard enough; I. had to answer for the sins of Governments for the last ten years. If honorable members would bring forward something new for the Government to deal with, we ' might get ahead with the business. We are told that one of the reasons for the Country party's proposal for the reduction of Supply is that it insists upon the Government exercising due economy. We have in this House a combination of the. Opposition and the Country party in an effort to browbeat the Government. The honorable member for Macquarie (Mr. Nicholls), in his speech last week, gave an illustration of what he desired for the economical working of the country. He insisted that the Government were spending too much money; but, at the same time, asked that 200 employees who have been discharged from the Lithgow Small Arms Factory should be continued in their employment, although we do not now want the rifles produced. To-day the honorable member for . Dalley (Mr. Mahony) criticised severely the persons who were sent to America by the Commonwealth Government to supervise the construction of wooden ships. The honorable member evidently forgot that it was urgently necessary, when the contracts were made, that we should have more ships, regardless of whether or not they were in a proper condition.. It was more important that Australia should have ships in some condition, in order to get her produce away, than that the launching of them should be delayed at the shipbuilding yards on technical grounds. I could not help smiling when the honorable member said that those supervisors were receiving Â£500 per annum practically for doing nothing: I started to mentally compare them with some of the politicians, to the great disadvantage of the latter. In regard to the criticism by General Lassetter, the remark made concerning an honorable member in this Chamber might be applied to him, viz., that he is looking at Australian conditions to-day with the eyes of 1914. General Lassetter might be put in the same position, and be absolutely unable to answer' for the opinions of the wheat and wool-grower? at the present time. A remark was also made that the British Parliament was not treated during the war period as this Parliament was. I was in England in 1915, and the squeals from the British Parliamentarians were almost as loud as those we have heard from members of the Opposition to-night. The British Government found it necessary to carry on the work of the country and 'to practically suspend the rest of the Parliament. If we could do the same in Australia, allowing a few strong men to carry on the affairs of the country, instead of having a lot of members talking and wasting time, the country might be the better for it. Exception was taken by the honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) to the remarks of the Prime Minister that this Parliament was elected to work, and not to talk. I -could hardly understand the honorable members objection to that remark. Prom the way he was speaking, I judged that he thought that honorable members were returned to talk, and not to work.

During the many years that I have been a member of this House I have seen much legislation of a beneficial nature enacted as a result of motions tabled by private members. I remember the time .when the honorable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) would speak for an hour or an hour and a half on the subject of land taxation, and when other members at considerable length advocated the claims of the fruit-growing industry. This motion is an attempt to further curtail the privileges of private members, which have already been greatly curtailed under the Standing Orders. During recent years our Standing Orders have been butchered. This is- a new Parliament, containing a number of new members, some of whom might have helpful views on important matters which they desire to place before the House, views which, if considered, might assist . in the progress and development of this country. We should give them the opportunity to state those views. Apparently, the Government is anxious to prevent honorable members from bringing forward any matters which may lead to useful legislation. Had I known that this motion would be introduced, I might have prepared a list showing the useful legislation which has been ' placed upon the statute-book as a result of the motions of private members. I am certain that had I done so the list would have been illuminating. Actions of the kind contemplated by the Government are to be deplored. Instead of causing people to respect our parliamentary institutions such actions cause them to be held in contempt. I understand that this matter was brought before the members of the Nationalist party yesterday at their caucus meeting. We hear from time to time that these meetings are somewhat lively. It is probable that when this proposal was mentioned some honorable members objected to it; but whether that be so or not, I know that the electors expect their representatives in this House to attend to the business of the country, and not be so anxious to get into recess. If this motion is carried, what opportunity will Opposition members have to criticize the proposals of the Government? Opportunity should be given to the members of His Majesty's Opposition to express their views on any matter affecting the welfare of the country. This motion will reveal to the public the desire of the Government to evade its parliamentary responsibilities, and to prevent useful legislation from being enacted. On Friday mornings honorable members on this side of the House usually cast a few pearls of wisdom before honorable members opposite, and, naturally, we do not view with favour any proposal to curtail our privileges in that respect. While at all times observing proper decorum, honorable members are justified in taking action to preserve their rights and privileges. I do not desire to shirk my responsibility as a member of this House; on the contrary, I have an overwhelming desire to serve my country to the best of my ability, and I resent the attempt to filch from me the opportunity to do so. If the motion is carried, and Parliament goes into recess, or adjourns for a lengthy period, the responsibility will not rest on me; the Government will be to blame. In his anxiety to get to the other side of the world and see Pall Mall, Leicester-square, and other places where I roamed as a boy, the Prime Minister is neglecting his duty to Australia. If my honoured leader (Mr. Charlton) were Prime Minister he would on all occasions put Australia first. The statesmen of Great Britain are already confronted with problems sufficiently great without their being worried by the Prime Minister. They should be left unhampered to deal with those problems. If I could prevent the Prime Minister from visiting Great Britain I should be happy to do so, as he will only be a stumbling-block in the way of men who already have their hands full in dealing with unemployment and its consequent misery. When I think of the suffering which thousands of those in the land of my birth are undergoing I can scarcely sleep at night. While this Parliament cannot dictate to the statesmen of Great Britain, we may be able to make some suggestion which would help in settling the difficulties with which they' are confronted. Some of our new members may have a scheme for the alleviation of the distress in Great Britain and other countries, and they should be given the opportunity to bring it forward in this House. Rather than take a prolonged holiday, honorable members should endeavour to find a solution of some of the problems which confront the world to-day. They would find ample scope for their powers if they were to tackle the housing problem. Was this matter referred to in the Governor-General's Speech only to deceive the people? Nothing so affects the health and prosperity of a people as the conditions under which they live. The housing problem should be tackled by the Government?

One thing impressed upon my mind by the debate is the disadvan tage suffered by some honorable members by reason of having served in State legislatures before entering this Parliament, because two or three of them have had the misfortune to hear the State Hansards, which have been disinterred from the dusty vaults, quoted in evidence against them. I am impressed also by the extraordinary nature of the opposition to this Bill. As a rule, one finds that Government supporters vote for the Government, and the Opposition members against the Government, and a clear line of demarcation between the parties is assured. Honorable members opposite have played their traditional role, but, as a novice in politics, I have been astounded to see some honorable members on this side accepting the assistance of members of the Opposition to score points against a Government measure. I have noticed Opposition members bringing to honorable members on this side marked copies of Hansard, and other documents, as ammunition to be used against the Government, and, in the lobbies, where one always sees interesting things, are to be found so-called Government supporters whispering and colloguing in corners with members of the Opposition. What is one to infer from such unorthodox alliances? I am learning that there are more ways of defeating a Government than by the votes of the direct Opposition.

There was no sudden rush to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force when the Government's intention to introduce this bill was announced, nor is there any reason to expect a decline of the number of applications in the near future. Figures indicate that enlistments in, and transfers to, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force have maintained- a steady flow, with occasional fluctuations, from several months prior to this Government taking office up to the present time. Therefore, there is little doubt that this process will continue and that many militiamen who, for their own reasons, have not yet transferred to the Australian Imperial Force will do so in their own good time. The present monthly rate of transfers appears likely to continue, resulting in a steady increase of the percentage of our medically fit personnel volunteering for service in the Australian Imperial Force. I have already pointed out that the number of members of .the Citizen Military Forces who have volunteered for service in the Australian Imperial Force is equal to the entire strength of the Citizen Military Forces on full-time duty when this Government took office. A large proportion of those who have not yet transferred are men who have been called up in recent months and have family responsibilities to clear up before they can consider transferring to the Australian Imperial Force. In addition, a considerable proportion of those who have not yet volunteered consists of boys under twenty years of age whom many honorable members have been rightly anxious to keep out of the front line in New Guinea, but whom Opposition members, who formerly were so solicitous for their welfare, now appear to be anxious to send into the front line outside Australian territories, and outside the South-western Pacific Zone. I wish to make it perfectly clear that present members of the Citizen Military Forces are volunteering for the Australian Imperial Force as freely as did their predecessors and that there is a steady stream of transfers. It is important that Australia and the world at large should realize that more than 70 per cent, of the members of Australia's fighting forces who are medically fit have volunteered already for service anywhere in the world, and that more are volunteering every week. Can any other country claim such a record of voluntary enlistments? These figures show how baseless is the charge that our soldiers cannot be sent to Malaya to rescue Australian prisoners of war there. Not only have the majority of them volunteered for world-wide service, but also it is almost certain that during this war most of them will be required to serve beyond the area defined in this measure should the strategic considerations require such action. They are available for service wherever considered necessary by the Government on the recommendation of its military advisers. I have no doubt that with the steady flow of transfers from the Citizen Military Forces, the release of more men from reserved occupations, and the call-up of youths attaining military age, the percentage of our medically fit man-power serving with the Australian Imperial Force will be maintained, or even increased substantially. There is every reason to believe that new recruits will volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force as freely as their predecessors have done. I say deliberately that no other allied country, with the .possible exception of New Zealand, will send so large a proportion of its medically fit and available manpower to fight outside its own territories. It would be a physical impossibility for the United States of America to do so because the facilities are not and never will be available to transport 70 per cent, of America's medically fit fighting men beyond American territorial limits. Honorable members will know or can ascertain easily, the approximate number of men that would be involved in such a move. The impossibility of the task of providing transport is obvious. The United Kingdom is in a slightly different position. Alone, its transport problem would not be so great as that of the United States of America, but considered in conjunction with the requirements of its allies, it appears most improbable that Great Britain would be able to send 70 per cent, of its medically fit fighting personnel outside the United Kingdom, even if there were no necessity to retain a large force to meet a possible invasion. Britain will be compelled to maintain that defensive force until Germany is so badly smashed that it is beyond the power of that nation to attempt an invasion, of the United Kingdom, and by that time the war will virtually have been won.  It is suggested frequently that the existence of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces as separate forces impairs the efficiency of our Army as a whole. I deny emphatically that that is so, and I take this opportunity to emphasize that within the South-western Pacific Zone we have one army under one control. General MacArthur is Commander-in-Chief, South-west Pacific Area, and General Blainey commands the Allied land forces in that area. His army is one army, including the Australian Imperial Force, the Citizen Military Forces, and the United States Forces. The efficiency of this composite army is impaired in no way by the inclusion of any of the units of which it is composed, and any one who suggests that that is not so is actuated only by party political considerations. To-day Australia is more exposed to attack than any other part of the Empire.

They hope to delude the people into returning them to office at the next election. They are chagrined at the knowledge that the Prime Minister has so ably handled this problem, and has been able to win for his proposals for the liberalization of the Defence Act, the approval of a duly constituted convention of the Labour party. Thus he has kept intact the Labour movement which represents the great mass of the working people of this country, who have played a very conspicuous part in our war effort, and have given a greater measure of co-operation to this Government than to any previous government. To honorable members on this side of the House who object to the despatch of citizen force personnel beyond the territories of the Commonwealth, I say plainly that our national peril demands the most effective use of all our forces, and amply justifies the proposal of the Prime Minister who, undeniably, is actuated solely by the desire to do what he considers best in the interests of this country.  The Citizen Forces comprise men fit for front-line service and men fit only for lines of communication work, which is non-combatant work. Further, when the Citizen Forces are drawn upon for men for garrison work, their strength is greatly reduced. To any one who says that we should retain all these men within Australian territory when fighting has passed beyond our borders, and is taking place in the perimeter of islands around Australia, I say that if we did that we should fail in our duty to the Australian people and to our Allies. We should then have Citizen Forces personnel fit for front-line duty standing idle in Australia; and as we advanced in the South-western Pacific Zone beyond Australian territory, Australian Imperial Force personnel fit for front-line duty would have to be withdrawn from the line, for duty on lines of communication outside Australian territories, which could be quite well performed by lines of communication personnel available in this country. Such action would discredit the Government in the eyes of the Australian people, and the Australian people in the eyes of our Allies. The Government has pledged itself to a maximum war effort, and it intends to carry out the pledge regardless of criticism. A. maximum war effort entails the most effective possible use of all our forces. That, in turn, necessitates the action the Government has taken in introducing this measure. We have, I freely admit, undertaken commitments which will strain our man-power to the limit, and impose upon the Commonwealth a greater proportionate burden than can possibly be undertaken by any of our Allies, with the exception of New Zealand. The alternative is complacency and probable fighting on our own shores. Our national peril is such that we dare not do less than we are doing. It is the aim of the Government to do more; and, I believe, that is the aim of all honorable members. I hope that the Parliament will speedily pass this measure. It has been introduced by the Prime Minister, who has done a magnificent job for Australia since his accession to office. History will declare him to have been the greatest war-time Prime Minister Australia has had.

I defy the Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde) to say that that is not true. Therefore, the only troops which will be used overseas on offensive operations are, unless other divisions be created, the men of the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions, plus reinforcements, and they are the men who have seen the bulk of the fighting. That is a scandalous policy -and it is time that the Government was required by the people to answer for it. I shall not be satisfied until the Prime Minister explains to this House what he meant by the statements which I have read from his policy speech. Opposition members are becoming tired of making speeches aimed at increasing our war effort in view of the fact that little attention is paid by Ministers to them. This, however, is a matter which the Government cannot dodge, because it affects thousands and thousands of Australian homes. Fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters of those in the Army Corps, which consists of the 6th, 7th, and 9th Divisions, want an elaboration of the Government's policy as to the use of Australian troops in action, and I hope that that will be given before this debate ends.  A tremendous responsibility rests on Australia as regards the supply of food to ourselves and our Allies now and also to devastated Europe when the war ends. Labour is of supreme importance in the production of food, but, owing to the Army being virtually in control of the distribution of men, man-power is almost unprocurable. An elaborate machine has been set up to deal with the labour needs of rural industries. 'We have the district war agricultural committees, national service officers, area officers, and so on; but, regardless of how necessary it is that a man be released from the Army in order that he may return to the land to grow food, the Army has the last say as to whether he shall be released, no matter how strongly his release is recommended.

He said that the greatest threat that the world and democracy bad ever known hung over us from Moscow. That was at the time of the great Berlin crisis, when matters were very delicate. As that statement came from one so well informed on world affairs, we must necessarily take notice of it and do whatever we possibly can do to preserve peace for our people.  I am glad that His Excellency's Speech indicated that the Government proposes to continue to support, and to improve wherever possible, the relationships of the members of the British Commonwealth and to strengthen the bonds between the British Commonwealth and the United States of America and other countries which have objectives similar to our own. That is the only way we can hope to preserve peace in this world and I shall give of my utmost as a member of this House to the achieving of that objective. Many of the honorable members of this House and many people throughout the length and breadth of this land know the destructive effects of war and I am sure that, having had that experience and knowing of the economic results that arise from war, they will give of their best in an endeavour to ensure the continuation of peace. I shall leave that aspect of His Excellency's Speech at this stage, in view of the fact that the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Spender) will be making a statement to this House, in due course, on matters of international significance. But while the Minister and other members of the Government are striving in the international field, we must, as a national parliament, shoulder our responsibility to provide adequately for the defence of this nation. Immigration, defence and development are so closely related that it is difficult to deal with them separately. Immigration is vital to our industrial expansion and rural development, and every effort must be made to bring to this country large numbers of people, preferably of British stock, so that this nation may be strengthened in every way. Honorable members can discharge their own responsibility in this regard by giving every encouragement to new settlers, and making them feel at home. There is no more lonely person in the world than the friendless immigrant. The Australian people generally must play their part and endeavour to make immigrants happy and contented so that they will settle down rapidly to a full enjoyment of the privileges that citizenship of this country offers to them. It is apparent from speeches that have been made by Labour members of this House in the last few days that the Opposition does not yet fully understand the reasons for the defeat of the Chifley Government. Labour will remain in opposition so long as it features socialism in its policy. It is true that the socialist objective has been in the Labour platform since 1921, but, for many years, it was kept under cover and rarely discussed for fear of its unpopularity. During the war years, Labour's socialist aspirations were revived, but at the 1946 general election the then Prime Minister, the right honorable member for Macquarie (Mr. Chifley), gave no indication that his Government, if returned to office, would indulge in full-scale socialist activities. He merely asked the Australian people to give him a new mandate to carry on as before., The electors accepted that assurance and gave Labour the mandate that it sought; but no sooner had the Government been returned to office than we saw evidence of a desire to embark upon measures of which no mention had been made during the election campaign, and for which the Government had no mandate whatever. Legislation was introduced to nationalize our banking system and to enable the Government to undertake other socialistic ventures. The Australian people rose almost as one and demanded from the Parliament the right to express their views on the Government's banking proposals, but the Chifley Government withheld that democratic right. Opposition members talk glibly about democracy. They had an opportunity to give to the people the democratic right to express their opinion on a vital issue which was to change the way of life of almost every member of the community, but they refused point blank to do so. They proceeded to act against the wishes of the people, and from that hour, the electors of the Commonwealth waited, day by day, for a chance to tell Labour just what they thought of socialism and of the Chifley Government's action in introducing legislation for which it had no popular authority. That was the real election issue in 1949. The result was a decisive defeat for Labour on the 10th December, and, as I have said, I am certain that Labour will remain in opposition so long as it adheres to the socialist objective. The Australian people will not stand for socialism. We are of British stock and we love our freedom, lt is a characteristic of our nation, and we shall not tolerate domination by any political party which seeks to take away from us the freedom for which we have fought. What was the record of the Chifley Government during the three years immediately preceding its defeat? It was clear to an outside observer that the greater part of the time of this Parliament was being occupied, in debating socialistic measures of some kind. When the battle was not being waged inside the Parliament, tire Government was carrying it On in the courts, seeking by some means to implement its policy of socialism. All that was going on at a time when the Government and the Parliament should have been devoting their full attention to Australia's economic recovery. The Government's preoccupation with socialism meant that the fundamental needs of the community were being neglected. To-day supplies generally are in a chaotic state and the restoration of normal conditions will take some time. We are told by Opposition members that present-day difficulties are war-caused. Admittedly some of our problems may truthfully be attributed to war, but it is five years since the war ended and in some respects present-day conditions are worse than those of 1945, which proves conclusively that, during the last three years, the Government has wasted the time of the Parliament and the nation. It has failed in its fundamental duties to the people of this country. There has been shocking waste of taxpayers' money. The full measure of this waste is only now becoming apparent as reports of various organizations come to hand. The people now realize what socialization means and how it affects their lives and gives rise to inefficiency in almost every direction. I am sure that they will never again return to power a government that wants to implement a policy of socialization. I refer now to the great primary industries of Australia. I welcome the proposal that was announced in the Governor-General's Speech to establish an independent cost-finding tribunal to examine at regular intervals the costs of production in primary industries with the object of providing for the return of a reasonable margin of profit to the farmers. That will ensure the maintenance of stability in our vital primary industries. Many honorable members have spoken of the prosperity that we are experiencing in Australia to-day, but most of them have overlooked the fact that the primary producers have been obliged to struggle against shortages and many other great difficulties in order to raise production to the present level. The truth is that primary production has decreased in terms of area, and also in terms of quantity in many directions. The prosperity is due, in a very large measure, to the exceptionally good seasons that we have experienced in recent years and are still experiencing. Such conditions may not prevail for a lengthy period. We must be prepared for what may happen next year. Approximately 150,000,000 bushels of wheat itrequired for local consumption and for export under the terms of the International Wheat Agreement. We produced about 200,000,000 bushels last year, but the surplus was harvested because farmers throughout Australia had a very good season, not because they had a record acreage under crops. Although all primary industries are important to the economic welfare of the nation, the dairy industry is outstanding because of the vital food products that it provides for young Australians in particular and for all Australians in general. No nation can continue to progress and expand its population unless it is supplied with essential milk foods. There can be no substitutes for such foods. The output of whole milk in Australia in 1939 totalled 1,1S9,000,000 gallons. In 194S-49 it totalled 1,206,123,000 gallons. Those figures disclose a slight increase of production over a period of ten years, but I suggest that it was due entirely to the good seasonal conditions that have prevailed in recent years. In reality, the production of milk has not increased over that period of ten years; in fact, there may have been a slight decrease on the basis of averages. During the same period, the population of Australia increased by 700,000, and the Government is now engaged in a vigorous programme of immigration. We must bring new citizens to Australia as quickly as possible in as large numbers as possible if .we are to develop the nation and provide for its adequate defence, but we must realize the importance of increasing food production if we are to succeed in doing so. A year or two ago, the present Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) visited East Africa in order to study at first hand the United Kingdom Government's ground nut undertaking in that country. We heard a great deal about that plan from the United Kingdom Government. Millions of acres of land were to be cleared so that ground nuts could he grown to provide vegetable fats for the British people. The total expenditure involved was Â£29,000,000, but the return was relatively slight. I believe that a much more effective approach to the United Kingdom's problem could have been made by means of an agreement with the Australian Government for the production of dairy fats. Whereas -the ground nut scheme in East Africa failed, the output of fats for Great Britain could have been increased much more rapidly and cheaply in Australia. Perhaps the East African experiment was undertaken because the United Kingdom Government wanted to demonstrate the effectiveness of collective farming! Had it made an arrangement with the Australian Government to develop dairy farms in our high rainfall areas by applying a complete mineral dressing to those properties, it would have been able to obtain greater production of dairy fats, at a cost of only Â£1,000,000 or Â£2,000,000, than could have 1:,een obtained in any other country. I refer now to the great natural potentialities of Australia. At the outset of my speech I spoke of the great rivers that flow through the electorate that I represent. I am well acquainted with the rivers of Australia and have examined the rivers of other countries. During 194S I devoted some time to a study of the methods of controlling waterways that are employed in the United States of America. As the result of my observations I am convinced that the time has come when the control and exploitation of our streams must be brought within the scope of national politics. The proposed new Department of National Development should be well equipped to engage in such work. The supply of electricity for light and power falls far short of the demand in every part of Australia. No nation has ever succeeded in producing more electricity than could be used, and Australia lags far behind the vest of the world in that field. The situation throughout the sea-board area of New South Wales is so serious that we scarcely know at what moment electricity rationing will be re-introduced. This state of affairs imposes great difficulties upon industries for whose efficient operation a constant supply of power is essential. At a time when coal is scarce in Australia and when we are seeking to import quantities of it from overseas, it is distressing to realize that the great hydro-electric power potential of our waterways is not being used. Our rivers have not been harnessed, and their waters are running to waste. I desire also to direct the attention of the House to the urgent problem of flood control. Last August the Macleay River, which is situated in my electorate, broke its banks and caused what was possibly the greatest disaster that this country has ever experienced. The flood waters seriously damaged the town of Kempsey and destroyed thousands of head of stock. It has been estimated that, as a result of the flood, between Â£1,000,000 and Â£2,000,000 was lost. {Extension of time granted.] The Hunter River, the Clarence River, the Richmond River and other rivers in New South Wales and other States have caused similar disasters, but so far no real effort has been made to grapple with the problem of flood control. The State governments, through their water conservation departments and works departments, have collected a considerable volume of data in relation to hydroelectric power development and flood control, but they are unable to proceed further unless they receive financial assistance from the Commonwealth. The harnessing of our rivers would not only be of benefit to our industries, but also encourage decentralization by leading to the establishing of settlements that might attract to the country areas migrants from overseas who are now wandering about the streets of the capital cities. When I was in America 1 inspected the Tennessee Valley and other great water conservation undertakings. The problems that confront the Americans and those that confront ns are very similar The Americans have accomplished much in this field of activity, and there is no reason why we should not make some progress in harnessing and controlling the waters of our rivers for i lie purposes to which I have referred. It may be asked how we can proceed to implement these schemes at a time when there is a great shortage of all the necessary materials. I propose to place before the Department of National Development, when it is established, some suggestions concerning several large hydro-electric power development and flood prevention projects in my electorate. The first requirement is that the Commonwealth should ensure that a comprehensive survey of the rivers concerned shall be made and a report prepared upon how the waters may best be controlled and utilized. That is the first step that should be taken. In the performance of the actual work of harnessing the waters of the rivers for power development and flood prevention, we must abandon the inefficient day labour system and revert to a contract basis. I am sure that there are British organizations that are prepared to enter into contracts to do these works and to bring to this country the necessary equipment and man-power. That would lead to the establishment of settlement areas in the places in which the work is to be done, and would make available man-power centres from which farmers and others in the areas concerned could draw labour. We have a great task ahead of us. We must take steps to tackle it now and not at some time in the future. I hope that the Government will shortly make a statement regarding the progress that is being made upon the projects upon which it has been possible to begin work. The people of the country areas are responsible for the great measure of prosperity that Australia is now enjoying. They are largely responsible for the fact that we now have large sterling balances overseas and that our financial position is very strong. They should be given first consideration when developmental projects are being implemented. I thank the House for the extension of time that it has granted to me and which has enabled me to deal with a subject that I consider is of the utmost national importance. I am sure that, with the co-operation of Commonwealth and State Governments and local government instrumentalities, a process of development will begin which will make Australia one of the greatest nations of the world.

I believe that that announcement will cause a great wave of relief to surge through the minds of all thinking people in Australia, because a general feeling of disquiet is developing. Everybody, no matter what his political opinion is, realizes the gravity of the danger that faces Australia. Up to now, nothing had been done to counter that danger. Many people are asking ' 'What is to be done about getting ready for what is coming '? On several occasions I have referred to the futility of relying for the defence of this great new country on a system of voluntary training. The previous Government refused to face the realities of the situation and pinned its faith to a system of voluntary training. At one time it stated that that system would be given a fair trial in the belief that it would succeed. I concede that a trial was justified. 1 submit, however, that Opposition members should now be prepared to admit that the trial has revealed that the system has failed. Therefore, every honorable member in this House who believes that Australia should be defended, must be prepared to admit that the only effective method is that of universal military training. It is now obvious that the criticism which members of the Liberal and Australian Country parties levelled from time to time in this House against the system of voluntary training has been completely justified by the number undergoing training at present, particularly in the military forces. My view of the present situation, which has been formed as a result of investigations in various places, is that, if the present system of voluntary training is to be continued, all the major areas outside the capital cities of Australia, and possibly some of the capital cities also, would be hard pressed to provide a guard of honour for Their Majesties when they visit this country in 1952. Therefore, the present Government has faced up to the position.  Let us consider the political situation in the north of Australia. We all know that if at any time a threat were to develop against Australia's security, it would come from the north. First, consider China. That is an enormous nation of great potential power and it is completely overrun by communism. The Chinese Communists have seized complete power and recently their leader spent several weeks in consultation with Stalin in Russia. We do not know, and may never learn, what the result of that conference was, but we must not overlook the extremely grave threat to Australia that it represented. Some persons have said that China bogs down and absorbs its conquerors. It is considered that communism will meet the fate of its predecessors. That may be true; but can the Government afford to base its policy on such a possibility? It cannot. A very definite threat to us may develop in China, and our policy must be formulated accordingly. Indo-China is assuming a more important position in world affairs, and it has been reported that that country is becoming a breeding ground for the ideology that is Australia's greatest menace. It is obvious that powerful nations are arising in the east. It is right that they should arise; but can the direction in which they are likely todevelop, be determined with any degree of certainty? Will it be such a direction that Australia will be free from any fear of attack? No one is prepared to venturean opinion on that matter, so we must be prepared properly to defend this country. Indonesia is at present a republic, and it is to be hoped that the statements that have been made about the peaceful ambitions of its people are correct. Certain factors that were involved in the establishment of the republic could develop in a way that would be inimical to Australian interests. It is quite true that Indonesia, if its people became hostile, could be a dagger aimed at the vulnerableheart of Australia. Japan ultimately may become a democratic nation, as the United. States of America would have us believe that it will. It may have no more warlike aims. When some of us were in that country about eighteen months ago, we were assured by the people that they had foresworn the arts of war. We sincerely hope that that is correct. But in time Japan will again be one of the great nations of the world, and may become a terrible threat to Australia. I am not waving the jingoist flag, but am merely surveying the possibilities that lie ahead of us in order to determine whether we are entitled to rely on a scheme of training which, after a trial that has lasted for about two year's, has produced about 5,000 trained men in our forces, apart from the regular nucleus. Within the last two months, Indonesia has laid claim to a large slice of New Guinea. New Guinea is an island of great tactical and strategic importance to Australia. Within that same period Japan has again put out feelers to ascertain whether permission would be given to the migration of about 5,000,000 of its surplus population to New Guinea and the adjacent islands. In. view of all those facts which affect the security of Australia, can we justify the policy that was adopted by the previous Government in regard to defence? I have outlined certain factors which, by implication, constitute a great menace to Australia. I do not say that other nations will attempt to acquire Australia, immediately; but in the political situation to the north of Australia lie germs which may cause the death of the British, character of this country. Under the previous Government's policy a nucleus defence establishment was provided consisting of certain regular forces. We have a relatively small navy, a regular army, and an air force. It is sound policy to establish regular forces for the services-, but they cannot be more than a solid,, well-trained nucleus around which our main defence scheme will grow. I am dealing in this speech, not with the regular defence forces, but with the forces of which they are to form the nucleus in the future. But that is not nearly enough, because the nucleus must be backed up by welltrained forces of some kind - let us call them militia forces.. At present, for this purpose, we have in the Army only about 5,000 effective trainees. I know that the plan provides for a force of 19,000 or more, and that we used to be told from time to time that everything was going well, but I know from inquiries that I have made that the present strength of the militia is not more than 5,000; effectives; and it is the effective strength of a force that matters. No purpose is served by a Minister, who has just attended a parade, telling us that we have a force of 20,000 strong if only 5,000 are, in fact, regularly attending parades, and I believe that that will be the effective limit of the voluntary system, if it be continued. All sorts of things have been done to increase the strength of the militia under voluntary enlistment. Those in charge of military establishments have done everything in their power. They played ball with the previous Government, and honestly attempted to increase the force to the strength required. However, in spite of all their attempts, in spite of parades and displays of equipment in city halls, the militia has been barely holding its own. It must be acknowledged, therefore, that tie voluntary system, in which some of us have never believed, has been tried and found wanting. Certain statements have been made on the subject of defence which I cannot allow to pass unchallenged. The honorable member- for Blaxland (Mr. E. James Harrison) made several references to- the Government's intention to introduce compulsory training, and I propose to- reply to them. I have no wish to pick on the honorable member' for Blaxland, particularly as heis a new member, but I intend to reply to his statements because they epitomize tha remarks of many other members of the Opposition, and exemplify the attitude of the Opposition towards compulsory military training. The honorable member said, for instance, that it was impossible to introduce compulsory training without interfering with the civilian activities of the young men of Australia. Does that mean that the young men of Australia are not prepared to stand up to their responsibilities? It cannot mean anything eke. Does it mean that the young men, if faced with a choice of preparing themselves for the defence of the country, or continuing to go to the races on Saturday afternoon, or to the pictures on Saturday night, will choose the latter course? 1 cannot see that it means anything else. Any government which is prepared to allow the young men of the nation to choose the races and the pictures in preference to doing their duty is not worthy of its salt. The honorable member also said, in effect, that Australians are different from the men of older countries. Apparently, his idea is that we need not be guided by the experience of other countries. However, Great Britain has found it necessary to train its men. Small countries like Finland, faced with the possibility of sudden assault, have found it necessary to keep their men in training for a period of twelve months. It seems to. me that the honorable member for Blaxland, and. those who think like him, have been driven into the position of claiming that we are super-men. Are we? I do not how to any one in my pride in my fellow countrymen, but can we afford to flatter ourselves that we are so much better than every one else, and that the experience of others can be disregarded? Of course not. It has also been suggested that it is not necessary to grind into Australian men the essential qualities of the good soldier. The honorable member for Blaxland said that Australians had proved themselves in two wars to be men of great courage. With that statement of fact I absolutely agree, but with the conclusion he drew from it I emphatically disagree. I do not concede that because the Australian has proved himself to be a man of great courage and initiative it is not necessary to train him to meet a crisis when it arises. The honorable member said, in effect, ' The Australian has guts, and possesses all the necessary military requirements '. I say that, he does not possess the necessary military requirements.

When the Government, with a great fanfare of trumpets, announced the termination of petrol rationing, everybody thought thai the people would be duly informed of the means by which the additional petrol required to meet the unrationed demand would be obtained. That information has not been forthcoming. As a matter of fact the whole business has been shrouded in mystery. There is a growing feeling among the people that the Government has something to hide in relation to this matter. Additional petrol can be obtained by one or more of several methods. First, it could be obtained by utilizing our defence reserves. When the Labour Government was in office it was criticized very severely because it did not resort to that method in order to overcome the petrol shortage. Opposition members waxed exceedingly eloquent on the the subject. They contended that the Government should immediately utilize the stocks held in reserve for defence purposes and replace, them later when additional shipments of petrol became available. On the advice of the Chief of the General Staff, the Labour Government refused to accede to that request. However, when the present Government came into office the Prime Minister said definitely that defence stocks would not be used. Secondly, it could be obtained by the imposition of restrictions on essential dollar imports so that, without the negotiation of a dollar loan, increased petrol purchases could be financed by the provision of additional dollars. That could be done only by restricting still further essential dollar imports such as machinery and metal products. What the public wants to know is whether the Government has already instructed the department concerned to review such imports with the object of whittling down still further the importation of these essential items. If that has happened, and I strongly suspect that it has, indus trial efficiency will be retarded because industries will be prevented from obtaining the necessary capital equipment to enable them to meet the production programme. Thirdly, it could be obtained by resort to the French petrol market. When the importation of French petrol was first mooted we wore told that such petrol would cost an additional 3d. a gallon. No statement has yet been made by the Government in relation to that matter. Does the Government contemplate an early increase of the price of petrol? During the election campaign the Liberal party circulated in my electorate a pamphlet headed ' Unrationed petrol at 2s. 6d. a gallon '. It contained an implication that if the Liberal party were returned to power the price of petrol would be reduced by 6d. a gallon. I have been asked by many motorists about the Government's intentions in connexion with that promise. I assure the Government that if it brings about a reduction of the price of petrol, it will receive a pat on the back from me and from motorists generally. The people are perturbed about the present petrol situation because the Government has not taken them into its confidence. The Melbourne Age of the 9th February last contained a leading article on this subject which was based on a broadcast promise made on the preceding day by the Prime Minister when he announced that petrol rationing would cease forthwith. Under the heading ' Large gaps in petrol picture ' the article reads -  ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[11]/para[16]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The bill is a half-baked affair. I do not consider that the Government is sincere in its intentions on th is matter. Th is leg is lation falls a long way short of what was prom is ed by the Prime Min is ter in h is policy-speech during the last general election campaign in relation to compulsory secret ballots and othe safeguards which, he thought, would bring about harmony in industry, and increase production. The Government, .fifteen months after taking office, has hurriedly introduced th is bill, possibly because an election is approaching, in an endeavour to convey the false impression to the people that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party were sincere when they prom is ed to introduce leg is lation to solve industrial troubles. Th is leg is lation is a halfhearted and weak attempt to cover up the Government's complete lack of industrial policy. Various prov is ions of the bill expose the utter lack of experience of members of the Government in industrial affairs.  It is significant that all the attempts which have been made by the Government to bring about peace in industry have been directed against one section of the community. I refer, of course, to workers and trade unionists who are the real producers of wealth, and have only their labour to sell. The producers of hides are on strike. They will not send hides to the market because they consider that the price is too low. Cement is being exported because the price obtainable for it abroad is higher than the local price. The Government has failed ,to take effective action to ensure that hides and cement are available to the Australian people, but it desires to take strong action against those who work in industry, whether the unions concerned are controlled by the Communists or by the right wing of the Labour movement. Every attempt on the pa;rt of this Government to bring about peace in industry has been directed at those persons who toil for a living. We ask the Government to show some impartiality in its industrial policy and drive for increased production, and to take some measures even if they are only half measures, against that section of the community which controls the wealth of the country and against those persons in industry who hold up production because of high rates of taxation and other reasons. Let the Government show its sincerity by taking some action against those interests. The Labour party contends that this bill is just another move in a series of moves that have been made by the Government against the trade unions in an endeavour to coerce the workers to sell their labour at a price lower than that to which they are entitled. Whilst certain of the principles enunciated in this bill will have the support of all reasonable Australians, the measure, as a whole, is so ineffective, and reveals such a bad approach to the problem, that it deserves condemnation. I shall vote against it. - I have listened with great interest to the speeches of a few members of the Opposition, and particularly to that of the right honorable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt). My own view, which, I think, will be shared by the people of Australia, is that this legislation is long overdue. I agree that it should have been introduced a long time ago, but it is now before us, and it should receive the wholehearted support of Opposition members, if they are honest in their approach to it. The right honorable member for Barton has a great legal brain, but I have not heard a man who possesses such qualifications as he does deal with a bill so inadequately as he dealt with this measure. Obviously, his heart was not in his task. I am not sure whether or not he understood what he was talking about.

The honorable member for Watson will not be able to plead ignorance of that fact. Opposition members who profess to represent the worker, appear to have forgotten that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was established by a Liberal Government in 1904. Trade unions are registered with the court and, for that reason, their affairs should be conducted honestly. The affairs of the majority of unions are conducted honestly, and the organizations themselves are respected. To be a trade unionist was once to have the stamp of being a good worker, but nowadays some of the key unions are under the control of men whose fealty is not to this country, but to Soviet Russia. Some of them are the enemies of the Australian people. Opposition members, if they require an example, have only to recall the former secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Association, who, for years, caused strikes in Australia, and is now installed in Peking, in Communist China. No doubt he is in touch with his fellows in Australia with the object of acting treacherously to this country, in which they have lived for so long. The Government has introduced this bill for the purpose of liberating the unions from the control of men of that type, and it will be welcomed by many members of industrial organizations.

Opposition members must realize that if the Japanese are to be kept in a position of complete economic helplessness and denied control over their own government it will be necessary to conscript Australian forces to implement that policy. The Opposition would not advocate such action as that because it would be unpopular. Nor would Opposition members have the Government follow the course that it has chosen. Therefore one is forced to the conclusion that they wish the Government to do nothing. The people who would benefit most by our doing nothing would be the people who sit in Moscow, planning control of the world. Admiting this to be a fact, how can we prevent the re-organization of some cartel system in Japan? We can do that only by police methods, and if such methods were introduced we could not make a treaty with Japan and give that country any sort of sovereign status.  I deplore the fact that such an organization as the Zaibatsu should exist in Japan, hut it must he remembered that the re are comparable organizations in America and England. I cannot remember any government of Great Britain, whe the r Labour, Liberal, Tory, or anything else, ever having taken action against the Vickers-Armstrong-Whitworth group, or any o the r great armament organization which has its head-quarters in the United Kingdom.

Other specious alternatives, which have been suggested by Opposition members for party political purposes, can be dismissed. The honorable member for St. George (Mr. Graham) referred to one alternative to a negotiated and fractious peace, and I must repeat it now, because the time has come for the world to express an opinion upon it. I refer, of course, to the extermination of the vanquished after a war of aggression. In my humble opinion, no negotiated peace has ever been final when the vanquished has had the will and power to rise again. That is the sad experience of the world throughout the centuries. To break that will effectively, and to destroy that power forever, a negotiated peace is utterly useless. That is not speculation; it is the experience of the world throughout the centuries. For examples, I need go no farther back than the Napoleonic wars. At the termination of those dreadful struggles, a negotiated peace was effected, and it solved no problems whatsoever. The vanquished had the will and power to rise again, and establish themselves as reputable members of the nations of the world. A negotiated peace when it was effected after the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, the Boer War and World War I. was not final. Each of those treaties was designed to subdue and subject the vanquished, but that purpose was not achieved, and after a few years, the subdued and subjected races rose again, and the whole dreadful process was repeated.  Therefore, if it be our intention - and it appears to be the intention of belligerent Opposition members - to break the will of the Japanese and destroy for ever their recuperativepowers, we are left with one alternative: the extermination of the Japanese. People who have the will to survive cannot be subjugated in any other way. I have no doubt that, bad the Japanese been victorious, we would have been exterminated. That would have been the only satisfactory way of dealing with us. Without our extermination, our subjugation would have been impossible; and without our subjugation, the victory of the Japanese would have been a hollow sham, and could never have endured. Extermination is the logical conclusion to a war of aggression, and the sooner the aggressor realizes that fact, the better it will be. But we waged no war of aggression and our victory leaves us, as victory has always left the victorious defenders, with the choice between the extermination of the Japanese and a negotiated peace. No one seriously suggests that we should exterminate the Japanese. If we are not prepared to resume hostilities against Japan, with, as allies, Soviet Russia, pitiable Poland and Munich-mutilated Czechoslovakia, our only course is to ratify the peace treaty. The treaty requires Japan to confess its guilt; demands the renunciation by Japan of its territorial rights outside the strict geographic limits of Japanese territory; confiscates the property of Japanese outside Japan; and requires Japan to pay reparations on a scale that will reduce it to impoverishment without destroying its economy. This treaty includes a declaration of the intention of Japan to apply for membership of the United Nations and ' in all circumstances to conform to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations '. The treaty ofpeace is designed to shame Japan, to subdue Japan, to confine Japan, to punish Japan, and to lay down the terms for the restoration of Japanese integrity. No negotiated peace can do more than that - or much less. To those of us who have made a study of history, it is obvious even now that Japanwill discharge in full its treaty obligations, no matter what they are. Japan will go to work as no nation has ever gone to work. Japan will strive for atonement as no other nation has ever striven for atonement. Japan will know a unity in defeat that no other nation has ever known, except in defeat. And Japan will survive. Nothing and no one can stop it from doing so. That is the nature of the Japanese, just as it used to be our nature when we said, with great pride - ","Second Reading","TREATY OF PEACE (JAPAN) BILL 1952","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Nothing can be more damaging to the economy of the country than for members of the Parliament to forecast a depression. The general public does not know the calibre of the Opposition, and takes it for granted that honorable members opposite are speaking with some authority on the subject. The Acting Commonwealth Statistician tells a different story. He considers that the Australian economy is tremendously sound to-day. He has not expressed that opinion in so many words, but the situation is indicated by the figures that he issues. Yet the moment he publishes some figures which ma.y not be favorable to the policy of the Government, an Opposition member hastens to quote them. The Parliament, and not only the Government, of th'e Commonwealth of Australia should endeavour to overcome any conditions that would cause unemployment. Honorable members opposite could best help Australia by directing the attention of the people to the present state of our economy, which results from good seasons for primary production and the flow of money from overseas for the purpose of establishing new Australian industries. Big projects like the construction of the oil refinery at Kwinana, in Western Australia, have never before been undertaken in Australia. Such works will, I believe, convert our present state of temporary prosperity into true progress. I have often spoken in this House about prosperity and progress and have tried to point out to honorable members opposite that hard work, not talk, is needed to cause progress. We experienced a certain degree of artificial prosperity when the Labour party was in power, but every body knows that that condition was largely due to the effects of World War II. It was never converted into progress. In fact, when the Labour party went out of office, that condition of prosperity was moving, by way of inflation, towards a depression. This Government has taken advantage of Australia's prosperity in order to turn it into the channels of progress.  When this Government obtained parliamentary approval to the wool sales deductions legislation, members of the Opposition travelled about the country and told the growers that the money collected in the form of such deductions would never be returned to them. I can see several honorable members opposite who engaged in that misleading campaign. To-day every body in Australia should know that every penny that was taken from the wool-growers by means of wool sales deductions has been returned to them. Members of the Opposition do not seem to realize that they have an obligation to admit publicly that their statements were incorrect. The legislation operated for only one year instead of for many years as they forecast. They should make an apology, not only to the Government, but also to the people of Australia. This Government has rectified a major fault in the provisional tax system by introducing a provision for the self-assessment of income tax. Under the system that was instituted by the Labour Government, a primary producer who had an income of, say, Â£6,000 in one year, was required to pay tax amounting to Â£2,755 for that year, and his provisional tax payments in the succeeding year were based on that amount. Therefore, even if he suffered from a disastrous drought in the second year and earned no income, he was required to pay Â£2,755 as provisional tax. Under the self assessment system devised by this Government, such an injustice cannot be perpetrated. A primary producer asked me recently, 'What will happen if I suffer from a drought and earn no income? How can I pay my provisional tax? ' The answer, of course, was that he would not oe required to pay income tax. Under the present system, a primary producer is required to assess the probable amount of his income for the taxation year, and that assessment need not be lodged before the 31st March of the year under review. Therefore, in a case of disaster due to drought or some other extraordinary circumstance, he will return a self-assessment form indicating that he will not have taxable income for that year. The anomaly that existed prior to the introduction of the self-assessment system was only one of many that had to be ironed out of the former Labour Government's legislation by this Government. Some are of the opinion that this Government introduced provisional tax. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the Labour party stands condemned because of the faulty system of provisional tax which it sponsored and which caused so much trouble to the primary producers, who constitute Australia's best asset. Nothing has done more to drive men off the land than the form of tax legislation of the Labour Government. Primary producers to-day are thankful that this Government has removed causes of injustice so that they can look forward confidently to receiving a fair deal. I read in the newspapers only this morning that the Labour party has decided to soft pedal on the issue of bank nationalization. Honorable members on this side of the House know, of course, that the policy, of the Labour party remains firm for the nationalization of industry, production, distribution and the means of exchange, and that members of the Opposition have declared that, although their former legislation for the nationalization of banking was held to be invalid, they will continue to pursue their objective until they succeed by some other means. No doubt they will have very little to say about the subject for the time being because several election campaigns are imminent.

He has mistaken the golden age. I advise him to have his eyes examined by the best oculist in his district. I was interested to note recently that quite a number of Opposition members apparently agreed that an attempt should be made to damp down the socialist programme of the Labour party. Accordingly, the honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley), who is, no doubt, a very astute gentleman, was called to fill the breach, and he devised a new preamble to the platform of the Labour party. I think that the 60-dollar question is, ' Do any members of the Labour party understand it? ' The general consensus of opinion is that the brain child of the honorable member for Fremantle is not understood by members of the rank and file.  If we do not want a government monopoly of television, and if it is the avowed intention of the Labour party to stifle private enterprise, the public will be well advised to heed one warning. The socialists are not uttering it at the present time, but we should ask ourselves whether there is a possibility of a socialized radio. I suggest that there may be if the Labour party is returned to office. The honorable member for Wills described as trash the sessions conducted by Jack Davey, Bob Dyer and others in the commercial radio field. Honorable members can well imagine the reaction of Jack Davey to a socialized radio. Does any one consider for a moment that he would appear on a socialized programme? I think he would ' Give it a go ', and empty his treasure house before the socialists could apply their policy to broadcasting. I imagine that the action of Bob Dyer would bÂ» similar to that' of J Jack Davey. He would ask himself, ' Can I take it? and would realize that the socialists would take everthing from him. Before they could do so, he would ' take it and go '. Can any one imagine that Terry Dear, who conducts the ' Amateur Hour ' would submit himself to a. socialized programme? I think his reaction would be that the socialists were not amateurs, and that he should get out of it while the going was good. Can any one imagine what that old stalwart of the stage, Roy Rene, our friend 'Mo', would say? Doubtless, he would say, ' I am awake to the socialists. I had better get into another business '. Imagine the reaction of John Dease and his Quiz Kids. I think that John would try to shepherd the Kids awayfrom the socialists. The honorable member for Werriwa (Mr. Whitlam) has had some experience of the Quiz Kids sort of programme. Does he want his intelligent thinking to be socialized as well as his political thinking? A threat by socialism to the broadcasting industry will produce an extreme reaction from those who are engaged in it. Private enterprise, if it is willing to introduce the system of television as an alternative to calling on the taxpayer to provide all the funds, should not be hindered in any shape or form by the Parliament. Whilst the present economic circumstances exist, the Government would be better advised to devote itself to the tasks already in hand without buying into the luxury business of television and creating other departments of distraction. I support the bill, because it enables the Postmaster-General to take certain action but I wish to make it clear that I do not assent to the proposition that the Government should enter the television business at this stage in the economic condition of Australia. Mr. DALY (Grayndler) [4.40'|.- The honorable member for Mitchell ( Mr. Wheeler) dealt with a number of prominent radio artists. Unfortunately, he omitted two artists who have recently become prominent, and are evidently sponsored by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He did not mention the perfect act produced last night by the Vice-President of the Executive Council ( Mr. Eric J. Harrison) when he spoke on this bill. This leading member of the Government endeavoured to bolster up a non-existent case and, in doing so, gave a better exhibition of clowning than has been seen in any theatre. At the conclusion of his admirable performance, I felt that Actors Equity in Sydney would send an urgent telegram to him, and in vite him to become one of its members. When he had finished his performance, we were at a loss to know whether he had given us the mystery sound of Bob Dyer, or an imitation of Johnny Ray, because his speech bore no closer relation to the subject-matter of this bill.  Another artist who will star in television is the Postmaster-General (Mr. Anthony). Possibly nobody has turned more somersaults on this important matter than he has. He has been more agile than a trapese artist in a circus. Government supporters have commented on differences of opinion that exist among members of the Opposition. To-day Government supporters showed that they were not unanimous on this bill. The honorable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett), in a splendid contribution, revealed that he was certainly not in agreement with the Postmaster-General. He was off the beam with the Minister.  What part has the Postmaster-General played in this matter? He flew to South Africa late last year in connexion with the inauguration of the new air service between Australia and that country, but this modern Marco Polo then proceeded to visit North America, Europe and other places for the purpose of investigating television. On his arrival back in Australia he had all the answers. He said that everything was in order, and that the Government would proceed forthwith with the introduction of television. When he was asked whether a royal commission would be appointed to inquire into the subject, he rejected the idea. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 4th December last published the following report of his attitude on the matter: -","Second Reading","TELEVISION BILL 1953","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Yet this strong man has criticized Opposition members for having differences of opinion among themselves. But let us look a little way beyond the present scene.

The honorable member expressed doubt concerning the reliance that might be placed on the findings of the commission. He considered that in view of Professor. Paton's projected departure overseas the Government would have been wise not to haw appointed him, and that Professor Paton would have been wise to have rejected the appointment. The criticism of the honorable member indicated that the royal commission will not have the confidence of the members of this Parliament or of the people generally. In addition to the shortcomings that I have mentioned in regard to the qualifications of the personnel of the commission it will suffer the disadvantage of restricted terms of reference. It will lack expert advice. The Government has overlooked the necessity to bring witnesses from overseas to give evidence. It is my opinion that the Postmaster-General is not in agreement with the policy that is being followed by the Government. Opposition members believe that this is a time-wasting measure. Apparently the Government does not intend that the commission should furnish its report for a considerable length of time. What will happen if the commission's report disagrees with the provisions of the bill before the House? Will the Government introduce amendments and proceed according to the advice of the commission? What assurance have we that the findings of this lopsided commission will be given effect to when they are presented? The Government has not much time in which to give effect to its policy. Its members might be termed, in the words of a recent article, ' dead men on furlough ' in the political sense. They have a limited period of occupancy of the treasury bench and it will be necessary for them to give effect to the findings of this commission immediately they are presented if they are to give effect to them at all. The purpose of the Opposition's motion is to expedite the receipt by Parliament of the findings of the commission.  It is important to all honorable members to have the fullest inquiry made in regard to television. No more important development has had to be considered in modern times by this or any other parliament. Such subjects as costs, balanced programmes and the ability of the nation to meet the cost of television having regard to the shortage of items such as telephone equipment must be taken into consideration before a television system is established. The subject of programme costs should also be considered. Under the terms of reference of the royal commission, matters of that nature are not covered. The bill conveys nothing to honorable members in relation to the Government's policy on television. The complete and constant reversals of form by the Postmaster-General in relation to television hardly inspire confidence even in his own supporters. What is the Government's policy in relation to television? What is the opinion of its supporters? Are Australian Country party members constantly to submit proposals which are to be rejected by Liberal party members in Cabinet? Has this legislation been discussed among the members of the Government parties or does only the Cabinet know the details of it? Surely responsible members of the Government would not have consented to the appointment of this royal commission if they had considered in detail the wide terms of reference necessary for a commission on television! Was the announcement that the Postmaster-General made when he returned from abroad in accordance with Government policy or not? The Vice-President of the Executive Council is one of the few senior members of the Cabinet who made a speech on this measure and apparently he did so without having read the bill. The Opposition appreciates the problems that face the Government, but we consider that it is time that it took action in relation to this matter. The Government has deferred consideration of it from time to time and is only facing it now for political reasons. Opposition members would like the Government to allow the Postmaster-General to express his real opinion on the subject. Surely members of the Government are allowed to express an independent point of view. Honorable members are eager to hear the view of the Postmaster-General. Let the honorable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett) and the honorable member for Mitchell (Mr. Wheeler), who have spoken in guarded terms on this measure, tell us what they really think of this proposal. Let the Vice-President of the Executive Council give us some information, apart from the clowning exhibition that he indulged in, about what he really thinks of proposals enunciated by the Government. I support the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, and I hope that in justice to the people it will be accepted by the Government. I hope that Government supporters who have expressed themselves as being opposed to the Postmaster-General's proposals will join the members of the Opposition in voting against the document that the Postmaster-General has presented to us in the guise of a bill. I hope that the Postmaster-General himself will see the light and join this side of the Parliament in opposing the policy to which, we know, he is really opposed but which he is unfortunately sponsoring. He should support the policy of the Labour party in this connexion. ","Second Reading","TELEVISION BILL 1953","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/para[22]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Time passed, and a few weeks ago, the Government reaffirmed its policy regarding commercial as well as national television. It has now taken the first step to give effect to that reaffirmed policy by introducing this short enabling bill. But we also decided that, before we brought in a detailed bill, we would, in the interests of the Australian people and for the reasons given by many honorable members including Opposition members, examine where this policy would lead us. We believe that the introduction of television in Australia may create social problems if the system is not properly handled. We consider that television has enormous social implications. That conclusion is reached by any one who has observed the operation of television in other parts of the world. Therefore, to rush blindly into television, without any investigation, as the Labour Government intended in 1948 with the establishment of a station in each of the six capital cities, was, in our opinion, completely wrong. Accordingly, we have appointed a royal commission to examine some of the implications of television.  The members of the royal commission are eminent ladies and gentlemen in the community. They have wide interests, and must be trusted to exercise wise judgment in advising the Government. The royal commission will inquire into and report upon - the number of national and commercial television stations which can effectively be established and operated, having regard to the financial and economic considerations involved and the availability of suitable programmes; Australia has a comparatively small population, which is widely distributed. Some of the problems that arise are where the television stations shall be located, how many shall be constructed, and what groups of people they shall serve. Those are matters of profound difficulty and great national importance. The next matter which the commission will inquire into and report upon is - the areas which might be served by television stations and the stages by which they should be established. Is the television service to be limited to the large cities, where it may be carried on presumably at a profit, or will a service be given to some of the country areas? If such a service is given to country areas, who is to pay for it? That is another matter of profound importance. Other matters upon which the commission has been asked to report are - The conditions which should apply to the establishment of television stations; The standards to be observed in the programmes of national and commercial television stations to ensure the best use of television broadcasting in the public interest; Any conditions which may be considered desirable to apply to the television broadcasting of - (i) political and controversial matter and issues; (ii) religious service and other religious matter: (iii) advertisements; The last matter but by no means the least is as follows : - (/) The conditions if any which should be imposed with respect to periods of broadcasting of the television programmes; I know from my limited experience gained when I was abroad a few years ago, that television programmes are given in England for only a comparatively short period each day. The programmes in the United States of America occupy much longer periods. What are the social implications of that? Are we to plunge blindly into this matter, and inflict upon the community something which may later prove to be uneconomic or bad for the people? Or are we to get some of the best brains in the community to advise us?For all these and many other reasons, the Government has appointed the royal commission.

I have in my hand a letter which appears under the letterhead ' Cramer Brothers ' and is signed ' J. O. Cramer '. Although it was written on the 27th April, 1939, it remains a significant letter.

But many people look for sinister motives when somebody endeavours to do them a good turn. That is not confined to Asian peoples. It is not unusual. Even in this educated, enlightened and civilized country, we find a similar attitude among certain sections of the people. The honorable member for Fremantle and his colleagues refuse to allow the people they are supposed to represent in this place to accept rewards as incentives for the additional productive effort that is needed so urgently in this country. Opposition members tell workers that they should suspect the motives of the boss when he offers them additional pay. The honorable member for Fremantle might well look at the beam in his own eye in connexion with this matter. Good example can do much to remove the doubts that exist in people's minds. No contribution that honorable members opposite have made to this debate will remove the doubts in the minds of the Asian people. I have no doubt that the people of Asia have faith in our bona fide interest in their welfare. But they are wondering whether we shall be able to do the job that we have suggested we should do. We have to convince them of our ability to do that. The only way in which we can convince them is by the Government convincing the people of Australia that they must make the necessary sacrifices.  I invite the Government's attention to the fact that those who could be the very backbone of our fighting force, men in the 25 years to 35 years age group, have been left untrained under the national service training scheme. Instead of being reduced, the national service training programme should be expanded. That would be one means of showing the people of Asia that they can have faith in the promises that we make to them. In that, way we could assure them that their freedom will be retained or, if they have lost their freedom, that it will be restored.

It is a part of the Indian sub-continent. Ceylon's Prime Minister, who was that country's chief delegate to the recent Afro-Asian conference, twice denounced world Communist aims. His sharp attacks on Communist subversion through the Cominform were made at a meeting of the political committee, and later at a press conference where he enlarged on his earlier criticism of communism. At his news conference, he said that the worldwide Communist party aimed to weaken free countries and. tuan Olean into satellites of Soviet Russia- or.' Communist China'. He- is reported- to have said, also that vague? Communist talk of peacefulco'existence: had appeared all too- often in the> past ' like- the' wolf of Communist' subversion ins the sheep's' clothing ofpeaceful talk'. That is- further support of the fact that aggression is- threatened* from Only one source-. The honorable member for Swan (Mr. Webb) and the honorable- member' foi- Adelaide have complained this' afternoon that the- arguments' that have been put forward on this' side of the House suggest that Opposition members are' disloyal or' are fellowtravellers. It is: not. my- intention, to describe: them in that manner,.- but it is a; fact that' what they have been saying fits into the Communist line in very manyways. It must also he realized that the Western democracies1 have found' it necessary to form certain organizations outside of the United Nations- organization, such as Nato and, more recently, Seato. Another fact that I should like to p'Ia;ce- before the House- is that theWestern' democracies have not shown any intention towards, Or desire for, aggression.  Whilst the outside organizations to which I have just referred are based upon the principles- that are written into- the charter of the Un ite d Nations, they also place emphasis upon the principle of national co-operation within certain areas. I have already referred to Seato, the treaty in relation to which was signed in. .September, 1954, which is the most recent, and the most important of such organizations to Australia. One: of the main- reasons why Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines,- Australia,- New Zealand,. France, Great Britain and the Un ite d States of America have voluntarily entered into this' pact- is that they have realized, that in recent months approximately 20,000,000 people have been, deprived of their personal liberties, and have been compelled, to live under condition* of dictatorial- government. These eight nations to> which I- have: referred have armed forces which total more than 6,000,000 men,- and a total population which1 is equal to approximately oneseventh of the World's population.. They control 62 per cent, of the world's1 petroleum products', 60- per centi. of' its coal' production, 55- per cent, of its', ironore deposits, 50' per- cent of its' steel products, and 40 per cent, of the total value- of world trade, As they co-operate\ they will be indeed a force for good and for peace- in the world. Another fact that must be remembered is' that the Manila pact anticipates co-operation between the signatory nations' in cultural masters and at economic levels as- well &s in the- military sphere1. The Manila pact, in. its military aspect; a:ets aa a shield to the area1 to> which it applies, but it also provides that members shall work together ite devising economic; measures and' promoting social wellbeing. That brings' us- to a consideration of Australia's role, halving special regard to what I. should like to describe as our northern, approaches. Australia's role can be divided into three' parts - first; the military aspect; secondly, the economicaspect; and, thirdly, our contribution to the promotion of the social well-being of the' nations that lie immediately to the north, and of those nations that form the front line facing the Communist threat. Government supporters have spoken already in some detail about our military responsibilities. so I shall nol speak about them at great length. It seems that the Opposition believes thai our main bases of defence should be on the Australian mainland, with, perhaps, certain air' force units' to conduct reconnaissances and make some' strikes when the enemy is well advanced along our northern approaches. Perhaps it is a selfish attitude, but we d'o not want the enemy ever to land on our shores. From the tactical point of view, it would be almost impossible to contain him if he did gain a foothold in' Australia. Our northern neighbours', who form the; pathway to Australia, do not wish to be overrun by the Communists. What help would any of our- near allies be to us, or what help would we be to them, if we were not. willing to accept, 011,r responsibility' and one share in this plan of cooperation? The best way to maintain the defence of our country and that of our near neighbours is, as far as possible, to contain the enemy within his present boundaries. The Minister for External Affairs Mr Casey pointed, out; this- afternoon in answer.- to a' question;, that the details, of our commitments; audi ofl the. degree tar which we will he. able-, to. help, are being.: formula ted: at. the present rime;. L have* referred very briefly- to- Ausralia's role im tha- economic- sphere- andin the promotion, of; social: -well-being and national development, in. South-East Asian countries, as. a result bath of it s, geographical pos it ion, and of the. trust; that it has been, able to engender in. those countries over the past few years. Australia should be proud of the fact, that that trust is growing. We have seen it on the government level, and we have seen it developing at, the commun it y level particularly in voluntary organizations. Vis it ors from countries which benef it from the Colombo plan have been taken to various' parts of Australia and have been entertained' in the homes, of the people, and by' small groups, and organizations of people. In that way, they have learned to- know us- much more easily: There is need for us: to encourage greater numbers of- people from South-East Asiancountries to vis it this country so that the flow of people- across-- the bridge to Australia may be greater.. It- should be- a. two-way flow. At present, an insufficient number of Australians is- moving alongour northern: approaches to- these- other countries: Certain voluntary organizations in Australia -a-re- making plans, and I hope that, when those plans are subm it ted to- the Government,, it willgive every possible- assistance! I believe that it will' do so. As' I have stated in. this chamber before-; I believe that- members'of the Parliament should be- included. among1 those' persons who vis it SouthEast Asia, because after- all,, they have: been, elected, fon as particular purpose,, audi they represent a> cross-section. of: the- Austraiian1 commun it y: If it were possible, for people; in. the. countries to' our. near.- north to vis it Australia, a? greater number- of South-East, Asians would have, the opportun it y of seeing democracy at work, in this country.

Opposition members, are not at all consistent. Most of their speeches simply reflect Labour's policy which, as was amply demonstrated in Brisbane recently, is unification - the centralization of government in the Commonwealth Parliament and the abolition of the State governments. Their idea is to have one supreme central government, which, with the abolition of the State governments, would have sovereign rights. The politicians would be supreme. The High Court, which is the only buffer now between politicians and the people, would be eliminated and decisions made here by the politicians would be final. That is not democracy to my way of thinking.  The Leader of the Opposition, after congratulating the mover and seconder, claimed that this Government had never had a planned programme and that all the accomplishments mentioned by the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Forbes) were due to the earlier work of the Labour party. The truth is that the foundations were laid by the Bruce-Page Government. The right honorable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) yesterday gave some illustrations of this. He demonstrated to the House that it is due to the Bruce-Page Government that this country is in the solvent position it is in to-day. If honorable members of this House look at the statute-book, they will find that most of the measures which have saved this country's economy were brought down then and are still in operation. The stabilization plan in the dairying industry was brought in in 1923. The equalization scheme brought in then is still in operation. There was no plan for the wool industry. The wool-growers of this country cannot thank the Labour party for anything. I remind this House that a former Premier of Queensland, the late Mr. Hanlon, at a Labour conference in Queensland some years ago advocated a fixed price for wool in Queensland. We had to fight that and we fought it very effectively. We have a free marketing system for our wool to-day and the wool industry has saved this country time and time again. I do not hear my friends in the Opposition chiding me as they did when in one of my first speeches in this House, I spoke of the necessity to do something for our farwestern areas, particularly in relation to our great primary industries. I was accused of working the parish pump and looking after the wool barons and beef barons. But honorable members opposite did not go on the hustings and talk about wool barons and beef barons. They were not game to do that. This country is very lucky to have an industry such as the wool industry to pull it out of its economic troubles. The general public should know that and should be given, if possible, an 'opportunity to appreciate it. Pasture improvement was encouraged by the Bruce Page Government away back in 1925. That Government also brought in a subsidy for superphosphate, which had the effect of trebling the supply of superphosphate and halving its price to the primary producer. Those are just a few examples of what the Bruce-Page Government did for this country. Now I intend to deal with some matters contained in His Excellency the Governor-General's Speech. I said before thai the housing problem was an important problem; but there are other equally important measures contained in this Speech which have not been discussed by members of this House at all. They, too, require some thought. The first one I want to mention relates to the free-trade area that has been suggested in Europe.

I know, of course, that party politics are continually brought into these debates, but I believe that this matter is above party politics, because it affects the employment of many men and it concerns the very important problem of the provision of homes for the people. All honorable members, no matter what party they belong to, should be interested in this matter, because it concerns the employment and housing of our people. From time to time we boast of the wonderful country that we are living in. No doubt it is a wonderful country, but many of the evils that afflict the older countries also afflict us in Australia, although it is a new country with many opportunities. The Minister for National Development and the Prime Minister cited figures to show the number of persons in the United Kingdom and the United States of America who are without homes, and they compared those figures with figures showing the number of people in Australia who are without homes. Such arguments provide no great comfort to homeless people, no matter which country they live in. The Prime Minister and the Minister for National Development mentioned also the percentage of people who are without homes, and we should remember that this has a most important bearing on our economy, and on the social well-being and general living standards of our people. An argument as to whether the Commonwealth or the State governments are responsible for the housing lag will not provide an additional house for homeless people, but the argument was raised by Government supporters, and Opposition members were forced to reply to it.  Thousands of Australian people are without homes to-day, and because the Government appeared to be taking no action to improve the situation it was necessary for the Opposition to bring the matter before this Parliament, as it has done by moving an amendment to the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. The Australian Labour party has considered the question of housing and has decided that it is so important that the attention of the Parliament should be directed to it, so that the matter might be properly aired, and so that the people of Australia generally might appreciate the true state of affairs. The Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) showed colossal ignorance of the position when he stated that the difficulty was one not of finance but of man-power and materials. It is almost incredible that a member of this Parliament, or even, for that matter, a member of the general public who took an interest in public affairs, could support such a contention. The position in the building industry to-day is that a thousand or more men have been put out of work because money for housing has not been available. Yet we hear in this place frequent references to full employment. It cannot be denied that both man-power and materials are in full supply. If the Prime Minister is concerned for the interests of private enterprise, I remind him, getting down to tin tacks, that the people who want to rent or build houses, and who cannot do so, are the ones who have to pay the piper. It is actually private enterprise, not government enterprise, that suffers because of the housing shortage. There is no doubt that timber mills and brickyards have closed. Honorable members on both sides of the House know that that is so, and that they have closed because insufficient money has been made available by this Government to carry on housing projects. It is surely a part of the policy of the Government to ensure that industries which are reasonably sound and which are helping the economy, such as the brick manufacturing industry and the timber industry, are kept in operation, and that their employees are kept in employment. Yet, we have the Prime Minister saying that it would not matter how much money was made available, that more houses would not be built, because materials and man-power would not be available. As T say. that is incredible. Apparently, the right honorable gentleman has failed to study the matter, or else he has been badly advised. It has been generally accepted that we need to increase our population, and I suggest that if we are to do so we must consider the facts. We must see that we do not embark on fancy schemes that will not result in the population being increased as it should be. Some people accept immigration as the answer to our population problem, but what is actually happening is that, after we have spent a great deal of money to bring immigrants to this country, many return to the countries from which they came because they have not been able to obtain a home in Australia. The requirements of the human race are food, clothing and shelter, and after those requirements have been met, people need health services, educational and cultural facilities, sport, recreation and the other activities which go to make up our way of life. We often have heard the proud boast that an Englishman's home is his castle, but like Australians, relatively few Englishmen ever own a house. If ever an opportunity existed to help Australians to obtain homes, this Government has that opportunity at the present moment by pursuing a vigorous housing policy. It is most important that young couples should have homes of their own. If homes were readily available for young people, the population would increase at a greater rate. Many young couples will not accept the responsibilities that children bring if they are living in flats or sub-standard buildings, and in respect of which miserable accommodation they often have no security of tenure. We must make homes available for young couples, as a first step, if we want to increase the population. It must not be forgotten, either, that the building of houses provides employment. If we are to continue to bring immigrants to this country with a view to increasing Australia's population, we must supply accommodation for the immigrants. It has been the general policy, in respect of immigration, to concentrate on male immigrants. In the north-western part of Queensland there are approximately 2,000 male immigrants, but hardly any female immigrants. Would it. not be better tq stop bringing male immigrants to this country for a time and to concentrate on bringing out female immigrants, with the idea of balancing the sexes? I remind honorable members who may not think that this is a serious matter, that already we have in Australia social evils which were never so apparent before, because of the numbers of male immigrants that have been brought here. The standard of Australian morality definitely has depreciated because of the preponderance of male immigrants, and that is a matter which every member of this Parliament should ponder. Members of the clergy, judges and representatives of welfare associations are very worried because of the increase of the number of delinquent children in Australia today, ls it not obvious that the ready availability of homes is the surest cure for this evil? A home means family life, and family life means a loving family unit. Children brought up under such an influence will not be delinquent, but children brought up in sub-standard homes under deplorable circumstances run the risk of becoming delinquent, because of the circumstances of their early life. I hear interjections from honorable members opposite, but I cannot catch the words. Is there any member ,of this House who does not agree that his early family life was the most important factor in the formation of his character? It is shocking to see youngsters who could have become fine young Australians turning into delinquents and helping to fill our gaols. That would have been avoided if their parents had had proper homes and could have established a proper family life. I am not expressing only my own opinion now. Members of the clergy of every denomination, judges and representatives of welfare associations are continually stressing the fact that practically all delinquent children do not have decent homes - that they come from places where the family has not been able to keep together and exert a good influence upon them. I turn again to the undesirability of the Department of Immigration concentrating on the immigration of males - a subject to which I referred earlier in my speechbecause I regard it as very important. This concentration of the immigration of males is creating social evils previously unknown in Australia. The best possible way to increase our population is for the people living here to have children. I have had long experience of immigration. I have been for 35 years in the north of Australia, and I have been in touch with our immigration policy since the early days of immigration to this country. In those days, north Queensland was the place upon which immigration was concentrated. In those days, the immigrants from Europe, like the English, the Irish, the Scots and the Welsh, came here to improve their conditions. Most of them have become fine citizens, with a real Australian outlook. They were able to bring to Australia their girl friends in the countries from which they came. They married those girls and had families. To-day they, their wives and their children are fine citizens of Australia. The important factor is the family. Any young man of, say, 25 or 30 years of age who comes to Australia from another country is still strongly influenced by his early home-life, but his children, if born and reared in Australia, will become real Australians. Australian-born children are, so to speak, the immigrants we need to build Australia into the country that it should be. I know personally many children of immigrants who went to school in this country and who now have families of their own. Immigration can be a great asset to Australia, but we must avoid this concentration upon males. The present policy is to bring boatloads of males to Queensland to cut sugar cane, but although about 1,000 men go to Cairns each year as cane-cutters, only about 200 remain. Most of the others go south to Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and other cities when they have got a few pounds, but if their womenfolk were there, they would not leave. They .would marry and settle down. That brings me to the question of housing, which I think every thinking member of the House will agree is one of the most important questions ever to come before this Parliament. It goes without saying that men must be kept in employment if they are to have food, shelter and clothing, and that in order to bring up their children in the right way and give them the educational and health facilities to which they are entitled, they must have homes. I point out that any money that a government spends on housing is returned to it eventually by the people , who occupy the houses, in the form of rent or loan repayments. A government does npt lose money over housing. It is only a matter of making the necessary credit available to meet a need that is of vital importance to the economy and the welfare of Australia as a whole. We have established a very high standard of living in this country, as is generally admitted, and all governments, whatever their political colour, should do all that they can, not only to maintain that standard, but also to improve it. Of course, we all have different ideas about how that should be done, but I do not think any honorable member will disagree with the statement that, from the moral point of view, the home and home-life are of vital importance, and that regular employment is absolutely necessary.

Most authorities at present feel that 75 per cent, should be paid by the users and 25 per cent, by the landowners, although the land-owners do not pay anything to the railways unless they are under a betterment rate, which to-day does not exist, to my knowledge, anywhere in Australia. An article which recently appeared in the .Melbourne ' Herald ', ' Trucks set road riddle ''. shows that in America it has recently been estimated that 26,000 miles of roads can be built to carry the ordinary private motor cars up to 2 tons in weight at no greater cost than 737 miles of roads to carry heavy truck hauliers. The proportion of capital and maintenance costs caused by a relatively small percentage of the overall road transport can be estimated and some idea can be gained of how heavily subsidized that form of transport is. by private road-users. I do not know what percentage is paid by municipalities, but it must be kept in mind that nearly all municipalities seem to be going broke, or are almost broke, in their efforts to keep up with the construction and maintenance of the roads. 1 want to go back for a moment to the report on the Australian transport policy of 1949, to which I referred earlier. I had the honour of moving the motion in the advisory council which led to the report. The honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward), who was then Minister for Transport, had the direction and control, and the costs were borne by the Commonwealth under his administration at thai time. I hope nobody will be prejudiced by its mixed parentage or by any feeling of political race segregation. If any honorable members feel that way about it, I remind them that at the present time there is a large number of members on both sides of this House who are again in agreement. If honorable members do not believe that, then they should read the report of the Government members and the report of the Opposition members on rail standardization. When the report to which I have referred was produced in 1949, we all thought we were going places. We were! We were going bush, and we have stayed there for seven years. This is most unfortunate. That report was produced by the best transport experts in Australia. They had been a long time at it, but unfortunately, rather early in the piece, I felt, the Government blew out its transport brains when it dismissed that staff at very short notice. 1 have never been able to ascertain the reason, but I can only come to the conclusion that it was due to vindictiveness which arose out of internal jealousies in the department itself. Ever since then, their successors - their dismissals did not produce any reduction in staff - have endeavoured to make up their leeway in the experience which they did not have and have produced report after report bringing the figures of the original 1949 report up to date. The only result seems to have been that we have gone deeper and deeper into a forest of figures and statistics, and apparently no one is able to find a way through the forest, or find a way out of it by going back again. Therefore, wc find that frequently when we start a discussion on transport in general we are side-tracked immediately by some one who wants to discuss one particular detail, such as whether diesel fuel should be taxed or whether petrol should be coloured. It is the old strategy of diverting attention if you do not want to make a decision. It is about time that we concentrated on the main principles of a national transport policy, without allowing ourselves to be side-tracked. I believe that the present Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator Paltridge) is very keen to do the job, but no Minister, however keen, can do a job if he is debarred all the time by a lack of decisions.  I am very upset, as are many other honorable members, to find that there is no reference at all in the Governor-General's Speech to transport, except in a very indirect way. We learn that a lot of things are under review. The Governor-General said - ","N/A","R.- [HI","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[8]/para[9]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Before concluding I should like to suggest some form of action which might help us to come out of the bush and get back on a firm road, or on firm rails or some other transport system, so that we can do something which is really most important to the Australian economy.  The first thing I should like to suggest to honorable, members is that action should be taken to implement the three recommendations of the Government members' rail standardization committee and the first two recommendations of the Opposition members' committee. These latter recommendations are almost identical with those of the Government members' committee. If we do this we will be laying the foundations on which we can build the future edifice of a national transport policy. I know that it is very easy to say that the Commonwealth Government should pay all the costs. I suggest to the Government that in its discussions with the States it might start off on the South Australian basis of 70 per cent, payment by the Commonwealth and 30 per cent, by the States. That will not upset the existing agreement, and I think it will probably be found that the cost of construction of the actual track itself will not amount to 70 per cent, of the total cost of the various standardization projects which have been recommended. In any case, it is a basis on which to start, and a basis that was originally approved when the South Australian agreement was made. But do not let us wait for the budget sittings. Surely the Government can provide the Â£25,000 necessary for the Victorian survey to be made, so that some one can get on with the job that every one admits should be done immediately.

The nearest that either Great Britain or America can come to this is America's figure of 3.54, despite the fact that our immigration intake is immeasurably greater. The building position has eased somewhat. It is now possible to build more houses. More material is available, and in some States at least building operatives are also available. I believe that we could now build more houses without adding to the inflationary trends in the economy, or to the cost of those houses. I am equally certain that, in those circumstances, money to do this will be made available. A favourite trick of Opposition members is to attack a government which is on the eve of implementing something so that they can claim to have forced the hand of the government.  What solution of our problems does the Opposition offer? First, Labour advocates a reduction of the immigration intake. Instead of building houses to meet the demand we must, they say, stop the demand. We must keep these people out. lt reminds me of the Irish politician who always used to take a roughneck around with him to throw out any one who asked an awkward question. In the same way, the Labour party would rather end the demand for houses than fulfil that demand. It is so simple that it is a wonder some one has nol thought of it before! The Opposition is to be severely censured for painting a completely false picture of the relative responsibility of the States and the Commonwealth. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) and one other Labour supporter, admitted that the States had some responsibility. Backbenchers - and some frontbenchers - have been anxious to plaster mud on this Government because that is the only way that they can hope to rise to high places. They may do so one day. but only if they adopt different tactics. The necessary money is already being made available to the States. After all. the Commonwealth is the custodian of the Commonwealth purse and is responsible for the economic stability of the country. The money that is made available to the States should be limited strictly to their capacity to spend it without aggravating the inflationary situation. That is already taken into consideration by the Government, but I see little disposition on the part of some States to show any concern at all for this branch of the economy. As long as they, backed by their marionettes in this Parliament, are able to blame the Federal Government for everything that goes wrong, and as long as uniform taxation is with us, they will continue to show complete irresponsibility in matters of national finance. It is amazing to contemplate that the Opposition has complained of industrial building activity - which must keep thousands of building operatives in employment. If there were no such activity we should perhaps have unemployment of the kind that we have seen in Western Australia. What inference is to be drawn from this attack? Is Labour trying to convince the people that the Federal Government finds the money for this industrial building, or that the Government should seize power in order to prevent it continuing? As a matter of fact, little of the material used in these huge steel-framed buildings, with glass walls, would affect the materials position so far as State housing is concerned. The quickest answer one can give is that the Federal Government has nothing whatever to do with it. At least private enterprise, in putting up these buildings, is expanding and developing our economy and giving employment to thousands of building operatives. Another moan heard from the Opposition is that in New South Wales timber mills are closing down. But the New South Wales Government is importing timber from Singapore! Last session we learned that, because of high freight rates and road taxes, it was cheaper to do this than to bring timber from the northern mills. Those mills tried to find an outlet by road hauling their timber to Brisbane, but the market there was limited. They had no alternative to closing down - their own Government was bringing timber in from Malaya! In making these accusations the Opposition is sowing seed in the hope that some of it will fall on fertile ground. At the same time, it is resolutely determined, lest any seed should fall on barren ground, to absolve the State governments from responsibility in this matter. There has been an attempt to create in the public mind the feeling that if Labour were in office it could do so much better. I want to examine briefly what the public can expect from the newly exposed democratic socialism of what was once the Australian Labour party. Its new policy, if it is to be democratic socialist as we have read in the press, contains these things, some of which are not new. It contains the nationalization of banking and of major industries. That is not new. But it also contains items which one would not expect to find in the policy of any party which seeks the honour of governing this country. One such item involves no opposition to Communists in the industrial field. ","N/A","R.- [HI","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[10]/para[4]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Attacks were made on the Labour party, and individuals sitting on this side of the House were accused of insincerity, their knowledge was questioned and the work that they have done was ridiculed. In reply to one of our members who happened to interject, a Government supporter said, ' You have never swung an axe and you have never used a hammer '. When that sort of statement is made by men who contend that they are superior to the Labour party it shows that they are very far down the road indeed. Opposition members have as much knowledge and experience of real, hard work, in the rural areas and elsewhere, as Government supporters have. If I liked to do so, I could talk about the number of lawyers, accountants, and businessmen on the Government benches who have never swung an axe and would not know how to wield a hammer. But I would not stoop to that sort of thing, because I realize that in this place they are doing valuable work for Australia. I would not belittle them in any way. There may be some Opposition members who have not swung an axe and are not experts with a hammer, just as there may' be among Government supporters, but, generally speaking, Opposition members know what real, hard work is.  The honorable member for Gippsland (Mr. Bowden) stated that it was Labour's policy to refrain from interfering with the Communists. The industrial members of the Australian Labour party are the only men who have fought the Communists. I quite agree that the Communists have had some success in attaining the leadership of trade unions. But I know also that we could point the finger of accusation at some aspects of the lives of men who have obtained control of other organizations in the community.

I agree with the honorable member for Gippsland that only one or two Opposition members have laid any of the blame at the door of the State governments. I lay a good deal of the blame at the door of the State administrations, irrespective of their political colour. I think all the representatives of the State governments, both Labour and Liberal, at the last meeting of the Australian Loan Council should have taken care to see that the allocation for housing was not restricted when the loans sought by the States were reduced. I do not propose to cite the allocations and the amounts sought in detail. They were given to us by the honorable member for Lilley (Mr. Wight) and, I think, the honorable member for Herbert (Mr. Edmonds). All the State representatives at the meeting of the Australian Loan Council, irrespective of whether they belong to Labour or Liberal administrations, must accept responsibility for failing to ensure that adequate housing finance was provided. If a shortage of loan money necessitated the reduction of the amounts sought by the States, the reduction should have been applied to other fields and not to housing.  A great many new industries have been established in South Australia. In my electorate there are many new industrial establishments in which hundreds of men are employed. We do not object to those buildings being erected, but other works which in past years have had galvanized iron fronts now have newly-erected brick fronts. This makes them look very nice and people say ' What an improvement '. But in many cases the man-power and materials used could have been better used elsewhere. I am not going to blame the State governments or the Commonwealth Government for all of that, but I say we should do something to see that the men who are available to the building industry now are fully occupied. If men are out of employment we should find employment for them. The housing figures for the whole of Australia were down by between 3,000 and 5,000 last year. We do not have fewer builders than we had two years ago. In fact, many immigrant building workers have come here since then. I am not blaming immigrants for the shortage of homes. I assure the House of that. I know from experience that immigrants are doing quite a lot of the building work in South Australia at the present time. Many gangs consist mainly of immigrants who have come to this country in recent years, some from the British Isles and some from European countries. Friends have told me of language difficulties due to the fact that a large number of the employees in joinery works come from European countries. So, I know that the immigrant is making his. contribution towards home construction in our country. But we should see to it that no man who is capable of doing building work is unemployed because of lack of financial resources. I was pleased to hear the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Harold Holt) say on Tuesday night that the Government proposed to seek expert advice on the matter, and that wherever things could be rectified, the Government would take action to do so. The honorable member for Gippsland said that the Opposition was always ready to precipitate a debate on a matter about which it knew the Government intended to take action. I say to the honorable member that we are not aware that the Government proposes to do anything about housing. We only know of the problem that exists. Even if something is done by the Government after we have hammered the question, in view of the recent statement by the Prime Minister himself that lack of money was not the difficulty, honorable members opposite cannot now suddenly concede that there is a shortage of money and claim that the Government was aware of it all the time and had decided to act even before the Opposition forced this debate. I say that there is a crisis in the housing industry. The shortage now is not as great as it was three or four years ago. I admit that. But the real crisis, as I see it, is this: I know from my industrial knowledge, gained before my entry into politics, that the first evidence of a recession in any country is a slump in the building industry. That is generally accepted. Unemployment in the building industry has a snow-balling effect. An Opposition member has detailed the reduction in the quantities of fibrous plaster sheets, tiles, and bricks produced last year compared with the previous year. Obviously, the quantities produced two years ago could have been produced again last year if there had been a demand for them, and they could be produced now. Complaints of building inactivity come not only from the Opposition benches and from leaders of trade unions; they come also from the Master Builders Association and in leading articles in various newspapers. Admittedly some newspapers are out to boot whoever they can and whenever it suits them, but in this case the protests seem to me to be justified. Newspaper reporters see the position, and if they can capitalize on it they do. I say that the housing problem is very drastic indeed. Reference has been made to the number of empty houses disclosed by the last census. To me the figures are ridiculous. For instance, at that time my wife and I were on a train proceeding from Perth to Adelaide and because we were not in our home when the census was taken, our house was counted as a vacant house. I suppose we were only two of many such people. On one day ours was a vacant house, fully furnished, and on the next day it was occupied as usual. The number of people travelling away from home on any one day must be considerable. Mrs. Jones says to Mrs. Smith , ' We are going off to the country to Mary's for a couple of days. Will you water the garden and feed the fowls while we are away? ' Mrs. Smith says she will, and if the period happens to include a census night, then Mrs. Jones 's house is counted as a vacant house. So much for those figures. The Minister for the Army spoke about the number of houses tenanted by only one person, and I was pleased to hear the honorable member for Deakin (Mr. Davis) touch upon that subject and show how it affects social services. Dad dies and mum is on her own. One of the daughters asks mum to stop with her and let her house; but mum says that if she lets the house she will get only 30s. a week after paying rates and taxes, and will lose her Â£4 a week pension. She says she cannot afford to do that. The Government holds that to eliminate this anomaly would be too costly to revenue. The result is that in not one but almost every, street one can find a pensioner occupying a dwelling alone. If he or she goes to live with a relative the pension is lost because the property bar is applied to the house, and most properties are worth at least Â£1,750 at the present time. The housing problem has many ramifications, and many difficulties, but the greatest single factor in the present situation is the lack of adequate finance. I admit that if every applicant for a war service home loan to-day were given that loan, it would not mean that that many more houses would be built because quite a lot of applicants want to buy existing premises. If a person buys my place and I move out, that does not add another home, because I will live somewhere else. I appreciate, therefore, that the total of new homes would not be as great as one might suppose, but the position would be made very much better indeed. An ex-serviceman may come to me and say that a house is being built and it is for sale. He can get it provided he has finance. He goes to the War Service Homes Division and is told that his application will be approved but that the money will not be available for eighteen months; however, if he can get finance to carry him over that period, his advance will be guaranteed at the end of that time. The result is that the unfortunate ex-serviceman has to pay an exorbitant rate of interest for temporary financial accommodation. Ex-servicemen's organizations have urged that this Government should take some action through its central bank powers to make money available at a rate of interest not greater than overdraft rates pending the payment by the War Service Homes Division of housing loans. That would not be inflationary. When the high cost of furnishing is added to the high building cost and the high rates of interest, the burden on young married couples is more than they can bear.

How easy it seems to be for the Opposition members who have participated in this debate to speak of the Commonwealth providing more money. Members of State governments, particularly Ministers for Housing, seem to think that the Commonwealth has an unlimited income. Let me emphasize the point that, through the Australian Loan Council, the States themselves agree on the distribution of the available finance. Having done so, the State governments should, as do those engaged in ordinary industry, work within their budgets and accept full responsibility for the results accruing from the use of loan money and grants according to priorities they themselves prepare.

Yester- I quoted from a journal published in Western Australia evidence that the employment position is improving. The worst thing that we can do is to spread about the countryside rumours that things are going badly and will become much worse, and thereby make people fear for the future so much that they will not embark on anything. If members from Western Australia believe in the future of Australia, and in the future of their own State, they can do much greater service for the unemployed than they would do by attempting to convince the people that unemployment is severe and will get worse, as some Opposition members can justly be accused of doing.  I desire to bring to the notice of the House the shocking conditions obtaining in the mail branch at the General Post Office, in Sydney. The president and secretary of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union of Australia, to which the employees in the mail branch belong, have sought the aid of Opposition members in an effort to impress the Government, the Postmaster-General (Mr. Davidson), and the Postmaster-General's Department with the frightfulness of the conditions of employment in the Sydney mail branch. They complain of insufficient space, lack of ventilation, poor lighting, and a shortage of staff. A considerable proportion of the staff is very inexperienced. This is due to no fault of the employees; there is another reason for it. The officials of the union have informed Opposition members that the position is going from bad to worse, and I think that, in some instances, this is admitted by the department. The union has complained about the position for a long time, and it claims that its protests appear to have been of no avail. The powers that be evidently have a genius for making excuses, and are ready with an excuse every time.

The Labour party knew about that, because its own Rural Reconstruction Commission, which it established, drew attention to the matter and made appropriate recommendations. However, the response of Labour, as the party forming the government of the day, was to devise a situation in which credit was made available to secondary industry - and I do not quarrel with that - in a volume which exceeded that made available to primary industry by more man four times, and on much more liberal terms, the terms which we now propose to incorporate in the Development Bank for primary industry as well. All honorable members know why this happened as, indeed, they know why Opposition members are attempting to destroy the Development Bank. It is purely and simply because the electoral strength of the Labour party lies in the big cities and not in the rural areas. In other words, honorable members opposite are prepared, for purely political purposes, to destroy this vitally needed institution.

I was hounded throughout Australia for twenty years because I had had the courage to establish a central bank; because I had had the courage to do what King O'Malley desired to do in the beginning, namely, to give the Commonwealth Bank control of the currency of this country. The Labour party opposed that action. Now it is pleasing to me to see the converts who come to heel and to hear them say also that what the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) and the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) did in 1953 was very good. However, we are told that what the Government is doing now is terrible. In 1953 the Labour party said that the Government's proposals would weaken the Commonwealth Bank. Now Opposition members say that the Government's present proposals will weaken the bank. Every improvement that has been made to the bank during the last 40 years has been represented by the Labour party as something that would weaken the bank.  What has been the history of these changes? Every time a change has been made, the Commonwealth Bank has grown and has become stronger. I think it grew 300 per cent, in the five years after we brought in our legislation in 1924. Since 1951 the profits of the Commonwealth Bank have grown from Â£7,306,000 to Â£20,961,000. This is the bank which Labour members allege is becoming weaker! That is the story that they tell in opposition, but in government, they were forced to follow in our steps because the steps that we took were right. There must be a central control of currency and its control should be entirely independent of the Commonwealth Trading Bank. I have never altered my attitude on this subject. I find a certain amount of hypocrisy in Labour's attitude to this matter. When I spoke in this House on housing about a year ago Labour members, by interjection, approved of my proposal that we should increase the ability of the Commonwealth Savings Bank to lend money for building purposes. These bills provide for that to be done, yet the Opposition now intends to reject them! There are other proposals in this legislation which are important to Australia, as the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Forbes) has pointed out. A Development Bank is to be established, yet the Opposition chooses to seek rejection of the measures! I would not mind if the rejection were for ideological reasons, but it is for a miserable political reason. The reason is that Labour members are certain of the success of this banking legislation if it is brought into being in this form. They realize that the bank will be able to deal with unemployment, housing and development and they know that they will not then be able to capitalize on the misery and privation of the people. That is the real reason for their opposition to these bills. Last week the Opposition condemned the Government for proposing to deal with the bills with such haste. In 1945 the Chifley Government wiped out thirteen acts in one section of its banking legislation.

First, these banking bills have been debated on many occasions in the past and I doubt whether anything can be said to-night, either by Government supporters or by Opposition members, that will add to what is already known by most honorable members and by interested members of the public. The public has shown its great confidence in the private banking system over the years because by far and away the greatest numbers of people still put their deposits, and therefore their trust, in the private trading banks, and numberless people also get their advances from them. As I have said, we know the arguments; we know them backwards, and nothing that has been said by the right honorable gentleman adds to our store of knowledge.  Secondly, we are compelled to debate these measures again, because, when these bills went to another place, they were rejected without any debate. Indeed, it is doubtful whether these bills would have come back to this House had they been properly and effectively debated by the Senate. The right honorable gentleman has submitted that the bills were not debated in that other place because one senator was sick. We were very sorry to hear of his sickness; he was respected on this side of the House far more than he was by members of the Opposition. There was regret that he suffered inconvenience. It was regrettable that the Opposition should have compelled him to vote. Such action was avoidable and totally unnecessary. What should have happened, if common sense had prevailed, was that the first reading should have been agreed to and the second reading debate completed. Then, if the Labour party wished, on the merits of the bills, on the facts and on the arguments, to vote against the second reading, that was the appropriate occasion for the vote to have been taken.

We have heard a number of slogans and cliches in the course of this debate. In particular, Opposition members have spoken about the ' people's bank'. Government supporters have been accused of making an attack on the ' people's bank '. I should like to emphasize one point in relation to the term ' people's bank '. It is very true that a vast number of people deal with the Commonwealth Trading Bank. It is equally true that a much vaster number of people have deposits with the Commonwealth Savings Bank. But it is also true that there are tens of thousands of people who deal with and have deposits in the private trading banks. We have not any brief for one particular section of the community but we are earnestly concerned with establishing a sound, workable banking system in which there will be an atmosphere of confidence and mutual trust between the various elements that make up the banking system.  The honorable member for Eden-Monaro and the Leader of the Opposition referred to the question of hire purchase and the honorable member for Eden-Monaro tied that in with his attack on the ' moneysellers ' and the ' private financiers '. I should like to clarify the point by giving a few figures. According to the latest figures that I have been able to find, the Commonwealth Bank has investments through hire-purchase channels to the extent of approximately Â£16,000,000. The private trading banks have investments in hire purchase channels to a total of approximately Â£11,000,000 which is Â£5,000,000 less than the investments of the Commonwealth Bank. The total private investment, outside the banking system, in hire-purchase channels is estimated to approximate Â£300,000,000. Therefore, it can be said quite clearly and emphatically that on those figures the interest of the private trading banks in the hire-purchase field is negligible by comparison with the overall total. I think that that disposes quite effectively of the argument of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. These four main bills have not been discussed very much. I fear that the smokescreen which has been put up by honorable members opposite for the purposes which I have described has tended to obscure the fundamental principles of the legislation before us and I want, in the time left to me, to mention a few of the main aspects. The first bill deals with the setting up of a reserve bank of Australia. In order to refresh the memories of honorable members I would point out that it is designed to reconstitute the central bank, a section of the Commonwealth Bank, and that it will incorporate the Rural Credits Department. The second bill sets up a Commonwealth Banking Corporation, which will comprise various elements - the Commonwealth Savings Bank, the Commonwealth Trading Bank and a third, and new, element, the Commonwealth Development Bank. The third measure, the Banking Bill, is designed to regulate banking, to protect the currency and the public credit of the Commonwealth, and, in particular, to replace, with a system of reserve deposits, the existing system of special account deposits which the trading banks must keep with the central bank. The fourth main bill, the Banking (Transitional Provisions) Bill, deals with the transitional stage only. Its purpose is to enact certain transitional provisions which are consequential upon the enactment of the other three main bills. Naturally, the changeover will involve a considerable amount of work and detailed planning. In addition to these four main bills, there are ten minor bills, which deal with necessary consequential amendments affecting matters not related to banking. I shall have to be brief because the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) wasted some of my time by calling for a quorum - and then left the House. Dealing very briefly first with the Reserve Bank of Australia, I would like to refer to a passage in ' Central Bank ', a book by Dr. M. H. de Kock - a central banking authority who was a leading member of the South African Reserve Bank - which was published in 1939. It reads- for the successful performance of some of its functions the central bank depends largely upon the wholehearted support and co-operation of the commercial banks, and such co-operation can be effectively obtained only if the central bank refrains from competing directly with the commercial banks in their ordinary banking business. That supports our argument that central banking should be removed completely (from the area of competition. Other authorities giving the same point .of view have already been quoted by speakers from this side of the chamber. We feel that, if mutual confidence and trust are to be engendered, it is absolutely essential that the central bank under the .new title of Reserve Bank, should be in a distinct compartment of its own, with its own specialized staff and its own board of control. This legislation seeks to bring that about. At present the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank controls the whole of that great structure, and it is hard to imagine that any human being, with the best will in the world, could completely divorce his interest as Governor of the central bank from his other interest as Governor of the Trading Bank, though these interests obviously conflict. I am not referring to personalities, but I doubt 'whether any one could be such a split personality as to be able to do that with complete success and impartiality. Most enlightened countries have adopted the system of central banking. They believe, as we on this side of the House believe, in a strong, independent, controlled central bank with adequate powers to deal with emergencies as they arise from time to time, to cope with sudden fluctuations, and to regulate trends in monetary and banking conditions. Originally the Commonwealth Bank was founded solely as a trading bank. It was not until many years later - in fact, 1945 - that legislation was brought down to give it central banking functions. We believe that, in the interests of the nation as a whole, present weaknesses in the banking structure should be eliminated. Far from intending to maul or dismember the Commonwealth Bank, the legislation before us strengthens the financial fabric of this country. We believe that it will meet with the approval of the great majority of Australians who think about it at all. A lot of study and thought has been put into the preparation of this legislation; these bills have not just been cooked up over-night. Far from it. They have been worked out with great care and attention to detail. We believe that they represent the best that we can offer to the people of Australia in the way of a sound, workable banking system. I should like to say something about the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and then go on to say something about the new Commonwealth Development Bank. I would like every one to be clear about the fact that the Commonwealth Development Bank will comprise the Mortgage Bank Department and the Industrial Finance Department, which are already part of the Commonwealth Bank structure. However, each is to be given more capital and wider borrowing powers. The Treasurer dealt with this matter in very great detail during his second-reading speech. He was very explicit, and pointed out that there would be a common staff for all three sections of the new Commonwealth Banking Corporalion - the Commonwealth Trading Bank, the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the Commonwealth Development Bank, but that their separate identities would be maintained. Each would have its own charter, its own assets and liabilities, and its own set of accounts. Each would be under the control of the board of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and in turn, under a separate, executive committee of that board. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro was very critical of the Government's method of appointing people to boards. With reference to that question, I should like to read to the House some remarks by the Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, other comments of whom I quoted earlier to honorable members.

He pointed out the benefits that we have received from the exchange of visits by national leaders. Last year we all had the pleasure of meeting, however briefly, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Right Honorable John Diefenbaker, but I was very disappointed that no opportunity was given to us to meet, and assess for ourselves, Dr. Subandrio during his visit here, particularly in view of all that has been said about Indonesia during the last few days. The Minister for External Affairs is going to Japan in the immediate future, and I understand that the Prime Minister will be going to Indonesia at the end of this year. These things in themselves are very good, but I do not think that sufficient opportunity is given to back-benchers to take part in this most important aspect of government. Missions go from Australia at various times to promote trade and friendly relations with other countries. Recently the trade ship ' Delos ' made a most successful tour of south-east Asia, and other such tours are contemplated. Another mission is to go- to the American west coast and: Canada this week. Other such missions are envisaged'. South Africa has been mentioned as a place that could usefully be visited with a view to promotion of trade. South America is another such country. I suggest that on all visits of this kind it would be most beneficial to have a member of this Parliament accompany the delegation, to give it the prestige of Government participation, to extend the particular member's knowledge of the area and to provide the liaison between the Parliament and such activities that is missing at present. I f one of our members could bring back to us first-hand information and impressions of the countries he was fortunate enough to visit, we would all gain something in our appreciation of the problems that are always present, even when we are dealing with the most friendly of our neighbours. Our relations with the countries of Asia are of first-rate importance, but back benchers, who, after all, are called upon to vote on quite a few matters that affect these relations, have no way of becoming acquainted with the many important features that are peculiar to individual countries. Even at such a brilliant function as the reception held at the opening of this Parliament, the back-bencher had no real opportunity to meet the many colourful visitors from neighbouring countries who added so much lustre to the occasion. I believe that part of our function in the conduct of the affairs of this nation should be to learn how our great neighbouring countries think, to find out about the things that we have in common, and to try to assess the manner of our approach, whether through diplomatic or trade channels. Because of the predominant position of the McMillan electorate in the dairying industry, I was particularly interested to note the reference by His Excellency to the appointment of an impartial committee of inquiry to investigate and report on the complex problems of the industry. I want to emphasize the need to keep this committee ' impartial '. If we are to get a proper account of what the industry needs to achieve an adequate basis of stability, it is absolutely essential that the committee of inquiry should not consist of the same men who have been making recommendations to the Government for years on the amount of bounty that should be paid. The solution of the difficulties of this widely scattered and completely basic primary industry does not lie in that direction. It lies in a thorough re-thinking of the role of the dairy farm in the community, and in rationalization of costs. In Australia to-day there is one cow for every four persons. There are some 600,000 people vitally concerned with the industry. One person in every sixteen is in some way dependent on the dairying industry for a living. The capital value of the industry is about Â£750,000,000. It is subject to intense competition from substitutes and synthetics, and also to illogically based attacks from ill-informed sections of the medical profession. Recently the Australian Agricultural Council, which has done a very great deal for this industry and all other primary industries, agreed, at the request of all sections of the industry, to have legislation brought down in all States to ban the manufacture or sale of filled milk, which is merely ordinary milk from which the butter fat has been removed and replaced by coco-nut oil or some other indigestible grease. In the statement issued to this effect, the council said that it considered filled milk such a threat to a very valuable section of the economy, namely the whole milk trade, that it should be banned. The total production of milk in Australia is of the order of 1,300,000,000 gallons, of which 300,000,000 go into the whole milk trade and 800,000,000 are used to produce butter. If it is necessary and desirable - and I agree that it is most necessary and most desirable - that filled milk should be banned to protect 20 per cent, of the dairying industry, the most remunerative 20 per cent, of it, then it is even more necessary and desirable that urgent action should be taken to ban the manufacture and sale of margarine, which is just as powerful a threat to 60 per cent, of the dairying industry. Incidentally, Mr. Deputy Speaker, although the agreement made with the Agricultural Council was to the effect that all States would ban filled milk, New South Wales has not taken action along these lines. The people of New South Wales could well bear that in mind when they cast their votes at the forthcoming election.

I think you will recall that during this debate many honorable members have addressed themselves to the problems of inflation and the extent to which that economic disease is present in Australia. Opposition members have told us on many occasions that they will announce a policy to deal with these problems, and we wait with interest to see what strong cure they have to offer. I might say that Labour's present policy of advocating a 35-hour week, legalization of strikes and applications for constant pay rises are not in themselves a cure, although they might be worthy of consideration.  So fac as' social services are concerned, there is little doubt that those who suffer most from economic ills and sudden rises in the. cost of living are those people who are on fixed, incomes. In this group, those who are the worst sufferers are civilian widows and single age and invalid pension:ers. I suggest that for the immediate relief of civilian widows, the Government might consider granting to them the domestic allowance which is now made available to war widows. While 1 do not wish in any way to deprecate- the need of the single pensioner and the widower, 1 believe that the other group which is in need of assistance is formed by those people who, because of their own savings and the operation of the means test, are not in receipt of an age pension. In fact, in many cases, they receive less money income than some persons who are in receipt of a full pension. So while we realize that much has been done by this Government to remove many of the restrictions of the means test, and that it is not possible to abolish the means test completely in a short space of time, I think we realize also that anomalies will exist so long as there is a means test. Another problem is presented by the person who is self employed or engaged in an industry which does not provide a superannuation fund. Wishing to provide for his maintenance during his years of retirement, such a person often invests his money during his working life in Commonwealth bonds, shares, property or some other form of investment. You will remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that some years ago the Government made it possible for a married pensioner who had contributed to a superannuation fund to receive an income of Â£7 a week without the rate of pension for himself and his wife being affected. It is obvious that under the operation of the means test at present, the person who invests his savings is unable to obtain an income of Â£7 a week because the asset value which provides that income penalizes his pension as soon as the value exceeds Â£200. Therefore, I suggest that the Government should direct its attention immediately, when next liberalizing the means test, to solving this problem. While we realize the need to continue assistance to the age pensioners who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in difficult financial circumstances, we must pay regard to those who, through their own efforts and industry, have saved for their old age. Therefore, we find we are faced with one problem which has two distinct parts. The first part is how far the economy can go in increasing the base rate of the various social service benefits which are provided under the Social Services Act, and the second is how far the economy can provide additional money to release gradually the restrictions imposed by the means test. Like many other members, I have taken the opportunity to attend numerous meetings of various organizations which consider these matters, sometimes speaking to them and sometimes answering their questions. Over the past two years in particular, the question has often arisen whether the Government would accept the principle of linking the base rate of the pension with the basic wage. When I have been asked that question, I have always said, ' No, I would not support it '. I have given that answer for what I believe to be some very good reasons. In the first place, I assume that those who advocate linking the age pension with the basic wage realize that originally the basic wage was calculated on the needs of a family group, which I understand to be a husband, wife and two children. If the pension is to be linked with the basic wage, and the pension applies to an aged married couple, it seems obvious that the content of the basic wage which provides for two children would be subtracted in calculating the rate of pension. I do not intend to cite many figures, but it is generally accepted that the minimum cost to a married couple of keeping two children is Â£3 a week. It is also generally accepted that the wage-earner of a family pays on an average Â£1 a week for fares. If we add to those two figures the extra expenditure of a family with children, we find that the age pension payable to a married couple is either just a little less or just a little more than the basic wage, according to the cost of living and the basic wage of a particular State. The next point is that Commonwealth governments, irrespective of their political colour, have never accepted the principle that social security benefits should be linked with the basic wage. As you may remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the system of linking age and invalid pensions with the cost of living index was tried twice in Australia and was twice abandoned. On one occasion when it was in operation, the cost of living index fell and so also automatically did the rate of pension. There was such an outcry at that time that the system was abandoned and the former value of the pension was restored, I think from memory, on the next pay day. No government has accepted this practice in principle. Finally, under the Labour regime when the former right honorable member for Hunter, Dr. Evatt , was deputy leader of the Australian Labour Party and Attorney-General, he introduced a bill repealing cost of living provisions, and he made quite a number of interesting statements on the subject. I wish to read some of them to the House because I have noticed on past occasions, when members of the Opposition have had difficulty in finding an argument, they have quoted one of their former leaders, Mr. Chifley. Now that Dr. Evatt has left them, distance might lend enchantment to his views, so I shall remind honorable members of some of the statements made by their former leader when he introduced the bill to which I have referred. Dr. Evatt , as Attorney-General of the day, made these statements - ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Yet the Minister for Trade has the effrontery to accuse Opposition members of playing the role of knockers in this debate, and of chasing votes. All parliamentarians and all political parties, of course, engage in vote-catching, but they do so on the merits of their party platform. I may say that there has never been a greater knocker than was the present Minister for Trade when he was in opposition during the terms of the Curtin and Chifley Governments. There was none more vigorous.  Let me now leave the Minister for the moment and turn to the Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt). On Tuesday last, participating in this debate, he was ungenerous enough to mention the shortages that occurred during the war and in the immediate post-war years of the Chifley Labour Government, and he dealt especially with pertol rationing and butter rationing. The right honorable gentleman knows full well, as does every thoughtful citizen of Australia, that the Chifley Government took its life in its hands by continuing petrol and butter rationing in order to assist the hardpressed people of the United Kingdom. There is no question about that. The Chifley Government's action was humanitarian. In addition, the economy was so sound that we were able to make a gift of Â£45,000,000 to the United Kingdom Government. I shall now give the House the facts concerning the situation in which the Labour Government left the country's affairs. The Menzies Government found, when it took office, that Australia had overseas trade balances totalling Â£800,000,000. After ten years under the present Government - ten years of the prosperity about which Government supporters boast - at the end of December last, our trade balances were down to Â£547,000,000. In terms of the purchasing power of the currency in 1949, Mr. Speaker, they were worth only Â£273,000,000. The Government inherited a favorable trade balance of Â£800,000,000, a series of good seasons and a long period of peace and yet Australia has now, in currency terms of 1949, a trade balance of only Â£273,000,000. No wonder the Minister for Trade said in an unguarded moment the other day that the economy of Australia was poised on a razor's edge. That is substantially true. As I have said, I believe the emphasis that has been placed on inflation by honorable members on the Opposition side is being echoed by some supporters of the Government, not because they are worried about inflation, but because they want to influence the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission in dealing with the application of the Australian Council of Trade Unions for increased wages. I know some people will think that it is incredible until they read the Governor-General's Speech and learn of the measures proposed by this Government to deal with the dangerous inflation which has put Australia on an economic razor's edge. The Government has intervened in the Arbitration Commission hearing to oppose the application by the A.C.T.U. for an increase of wages. It intervened, not in order to state a series of facts about our economic position, but to oppose point-blank any increase whatever in the basic wage. Such action is almost unprecedented. Let us consider the attitude of the Prime Minister to this matter.

I have figures here from the Australian Industries Development Association, which give the profits of 520 companies listed on the stock exchange. The highest profit is in the mining industries with an average of 14.8 per cent. I ask Opposition members whether they think that it is not good that the mining industries can make a profit to plough back into the development of the industry and so be able to increase our exports. The profit after taxation for retail stores was 8.9 per cent. Is that exorbitant when we know that a person can buy debenture notes at 7 per cent, or 8 per cent., or even 9 per cent.? Why build up class hatred on the basis that profits are exorbitant? Yes, profits may be exorbitant in individual enterprises, but if a free economy is allowed to run, others will soon enter those industries and by increased productivity reduce the profit margin. That is the very thing we are trying to do by abolishing import licensing.  The monopolies and the home luxury industries which grew when they had a super-tariff of complete protection have been able to charge whatever prices they liked and have made large profits. If import licensing is re-imposed now on what may be termed luxury or non-essential goods, the development of these industries will be stimulated all over again.

It is important that our minds should be clear about that. The second error into which the honorable member for Fremantle fell was to put forward, on behalf of his party, as other Opposition members in the midst of a great many other irrelevancies have put forward, the suggestion that troubles began with the lifting of import restrictions and that they would be redressed if import restrictions were re-imposed. As far as I can see, after listening to this debate and reading ' Hansard ', that is the only alternative that any member of the Opposition has put forward.  I want to spend some time in discussing this question of import restrictions. In fact the whole question involves very much more than merely improving the balance of payments position. To imagine that our present economic difficulties can be overcome by re-imposing import restrictions betrays a lack of understanding of what is happening in the economy. The stability of costs and prices, of course, is an even more important matter, and its achieve ment must, in fact, have priority over efforts to overcome the difficulties associated with the balance of payments. I hope that members of the Opposition can bring themselves to understand, although they do not give much indication of being able to do so, that on our ability to trade, which in turn depends on our level of costs and prices, depends not only the improvement of our standards of living, but even the maintenance of our present standards. Therefore it is essential that we preserve to this country its ability to trade. The Opposition, as I have said, has one suggestion, and that is that we restore import restrictions. Many people, and not only the members of the Opposition, think that this would provide a solution to our problems. Persons other than members of the Opposition in this Parliament have put forward this suggestion. The kind of argument that is produced goes like this: When we had import licensing we were not experiencing these troubles; as soon as we abandoned this system the troubles began; therefore, if you bring back the system of import licensing you will get rid of our troubles. This is a completely superficial point of view, and, in fact, it does not accord with the facts. Let us consider what actually happened, and put the picture into perspective. In February, 1960, when import licensing was removed, if not completely, then to the extent of about 90 per cent., a tremendous increase in imports occurred - in that very same month. It was so large an increase in that month that, if maintained throughout the year, we would have had imports running at the value of about Â£1,000,000,000 per annum. But this increase was not brought about by the removal of import licensing regulations. The increase occurred at the same time. It was the result of a banked-up demand, of a tremendous number of orders placed before import restrictions were in fact removed. The flow of imports does not start immediately or within a week or two of the removal of import licensing. In fact, the demand for imports was already there, and this additional flow of imports was the result of orders placed long before. To ease the supply position in the face of rising demand, and following the price rises of 1959, it became necessary to remove the system of import licensing. What would have been the result of not doing so? Obviously there would have been a much greater increase in the cost and price structure, As it was, costs in 1960 rose by about 4 per cent., but without the flow of imports to satisfy the demand represented by this rise, of course the increase would have been very much greater still. Would that have done the country any good? Would it have done the working man any good? Of course it would not. The first point I want to make, therefore, and a point I hope all of us will understand, is that it was necessary to remove import licensing, and that the cause of the flow of imports was not the removal of import licensing. In fact, I have demonstrated that it could not have possibly been the cause. The cause of the flow of imports was the enormous demand for additional goods, a demand incapable of being satisfied by internal production. Let me give the House one example of a commodity for which this demand existed. T refer to steel. Between the second half of 1959 and the second half of 1960 our balance of trade in steel changed from an export surplus to a large deficit, the extent of deterioration during that period being Â£58,000,000. If this excess demand had not been allowed to satisfy itself by a free access to imports, we would inevitably have been faced with disruptive shortages and a much steeper rise in internal costs and prices than we have in fact experienced. The fact was that demand had spilt over into imports in this way, I am building up a case to demolish the Opposition's suggestion that we should reimpose import licensing.

The whole country would then be wrapped up tightly in the hands of the socialists once more. If Opposition members would only come out and say these things instead of trying to cloak their socialist ideas from the people, we would have a great deal more respect for them. The reason why their heart is not in this debate, the reason why there is never more than a dozen of them' present in the House at any time, whoever may be speaking, and the reason for their lack of interest and their apathy towards their own motion is that they are all muzzled. In this election year they are not able to stand up and say, ' We are socialists. We believe in the socialist principles and we will introduce socialism when we have the chance.' Sir, it will be a sorry day for Australia if ever the socialists get back into power here.  We have come a long way and developed this country a great deal since Labour was last in office. But Labour will find it a great deal harder to conscript the labour force of a nation of 10,000,000 people than it did to conscript the labour force of 7,000,000 people. It will find it hard to bring in a capital gains tax to rob the worker of any profit that he may have when he sells his home, because the worker is already awake to what socialism means and what the controls mean. Labour will find it hard to smash the motor industry with petrol rationing. It will find it hard to bring in building controls and to stifle the press, even though it may set up its own Australian press commission. There is no room in the advancing, progressive Australia we have to-day for the stifling, miserable policies of socialism. The people will not have it, and Australia will not have it. I urge Opposition members to throw off the leaders that they have outside the Parliament and to act as parliamentarians. They should look to the development of the country and not to what Mr. Stout and Mr. Chamberlain may say. After all, we are members of Parliament. We are supposed to be free and unfettered, and it is within the power of honorable gentlemen opposite to kick off the chains that their executive has placed around their legs and to be parliamentarians instead of party hacks. In supporting the motion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell), we take advantage of the opportunity to express our opinions on the policies of the Government, and in particular the extraordinary policies which are alleged to be in Australia's best interests but which have been criticized by the vast majority of citizens and organizations of all kinds as well as by Opposition members. It is interesting to hear some of the speeches of back-bench members. The honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Pearce) commenced his speech with a tirade against socialism. It is rather humorous to hear honorable members criticizing socialism, because government itself is socialism. When backbench members criticize socialism, they are either ignorant of the concept of government or they are trying to drag a red herring across the trail.

On the other hand, Opposition members have urged the Government to use selective import licensing, which has been effective in the past. I grant that the system has some unsatisfactory aspects, but they are by and large quite infinitesimal when compared with the overall benefit that is derived from the system. Import licensing has been used by both Labour and Liberal governments, but for some reason which this Government has not disclosed, it now stubbornly refuses to use import licensing to control our balance of payments. lt was painful to hear the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. McEwen) last week use the domestic scene as an illustration.

He said that the country is in a desperate position, that from the Government's bungling will come the misery of depression, and that the tragic conditions of unemployment are unbelievable. These impressions exist only in the minds of Opposition members and such statements, I regret to say, are an expression of their hopes. This country has never been so prosperous. I believe that it will continue to be prosperous unless the Labour Party and other self-interested critics succeed in their tactics of panic and gloom. They have been successful in forcing the Government to change its economic policy more often than otherwise would have been necessary. To obtain a more balanced view would be a tremendous help.  Undoubtedly inflation is the great enemy of our economy. Last year, when it was so clear, it was the main topic of conversation of leader writers and all thoughtful people. Members of the Liberal Party were continually referring to its dangers and the critics wanted to know what the Government was doing about it. Actually it was doing something at that time. As soon as the Government takes any direct action - in fact, any action whatever - to correct inflation it is bitterly attacked. There has never been a truer statement than that the Labour Party's policy in relation to inflation is like Satan rebuking sin. Labour wants disruption. Members of the Labour Party want the people to be dissatisfied so that Labour will be provided with an opportunity to attain its own ambitions. But Labour will have a colossal task in trying to convince the people that this country is being ruined. I recently drove from Adelaide and through Melbourne to Sydney and Canberra on week-days. What did I find? I found that the roads were crowded with motor cars and that motels dotted all over the country were full by 5 o'clock in the afternoon. In every town and village at which I called the shops were full of goods and hundreds of shoppers were buying those goods. In spite of the magnitude of the problem associated with our balance of payments, great quantities of goods are being imported and people have plenty of money with which to buy those goods. But if we were to believe the Labour Party, we would regard the country as being ruined. I was interested a few days ago to see in a Sydney newspaper an article headed, I think, ' Give us this day our daily water '. That article contained statistics which showed that the daily consumption of water in New South Wales was 19 gallons per capita - 19 gallons for every man, woman and child in the State. The statistics revealed also the interesting fact that the people of that State drink 24 gallons of beer per capita per annum. I am not too sure whether the statistics covering the consumption of beer were included in those relating to the consumption of water, because beer is 95 per cent, water, but clearly there is nothing wrong with a country which can produce luxury commodities to that degree. Such articles can be read in the press daily. I repeat that the Labour Party will have a hard job trying to convince the people that we do not enjoy high standards of living. Unfortunately, in the process of trying to convince the people Labour spokesmen scare them a little. That has a tremendous effect on our finances, which depend substantially on the confidence of the people. As any one with a small knowledge of economics knows, our whole economic structure is built upon confidence - confidence in the belief .that we can put our money in the bank and draw a cheque when we want to. Whether we save or live up to our income, our financial affairs are based upon confidence. It is the task of the Government to maintain that confidence in the face of the predictions of the Labour Party and, unfortunately, of our great newspapers and interested group organizations which are producing publicity that confuses members of the public who have time to read only the headlines. I believe that is why the Government is accused of being a stop-go government. The basis of such accusations is the psychological effect of the stop-go publicity that is directed against the Government. Therefore, any counter-action that is taken by the Government must be of a stop-go nature. I believe that it must be, and always will be, the task of the Government to counter undesirable economic movements as they become apparent. The Government has nothing to be ashamed of in having altered its policy in accordance with changing circumstances. The Government can be proud of what it has done, it can fully justify its actions, and the people of Australia will learn the wisdom of what has been done. Let us face another fundamental fact. We cannot have it both ways; we cannot have boom conditions and at the same time curb inflation without controls. Nor can we have depressed conditions and control deflation without controls. To suggest otherwise would be just as stupid as saying that if we had some eggs we could have some bacon and eggs if we had the bacon. I believe that the controls that the Government has imposed are not contrary to Liberal-Country Party policy. Moreover, they are not the kind of controls that a socialist government would impose. So, I appeal not to members of the Labour Party - that would be a waste of time - 'but to the responsible people and to the newspapers to remember the great responsibility they have to assist in maintaining a stable economy. Let them take note of the tremendous psychological effects of biased and selfish publicity, which could undermine their very existence. Let me give another example of what can happen. Just recently, I met a few men at an hotel at about half-past five in 'the afternoon. They were all talking about bank credit. One fellow said, ' By Heavens, things are bad with this restriction of credit. My friend has only Â£30 left in his bank account and they will not let him draw a cheque for Â£10.' That is an example of the psychological reaction that is caused by biased publicity. It illustrates the danger of irresponsible criticism of credit restrictions such as we have heard to-night.

He challenged the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) to name a target. What an extraordinary challenge. Have we in Australia come to a time when we are to- give every industry a production target? Once we do that, we have to apportion between manufacturers their various shares of the market, and once that is done-, the next and obvious step would be something which perhaps the Opposition would welcome - the setting of work norms for individual workers m the plants. That may be what Opposition members want, but is certainly not what honorable members on this side of the chamber or the Australian people want. Not only is the Leader of the Opposition wrong in this philosophical approach, but he is wrong in fact because the motor car industry, on which he built this vehicle of criticism, does not want it either. It is a bustling, competitive industry. AH those engaged in it are looking for an increased share of the market. They do not want this sort of control with the setting of targets, the setting of norms and sharing of the market.  In the course of his speech, the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the inequity of the 20 per cent, investment allowance. His very words show that he misunderstands the nature of this provision, that he misunderstands the nature of industry and of productive capacity in Australia. He said that the allowance should not be made because there was already in Australia unused productive capacity. If he looks at the Department of Trade's summary of production in Australia two years ago, at the very height of the boom in Australia, he will find that in many industries there was up to 40 per cent, unused capacity. The whole point is that a factory will not put in machinery capable of producing only X number of units because that number happens to balance the number of orders. If that were done, there would be no possibility of expansion. These undertakings must install plant capable of producing far more than they are currently producing and for which they have orders. That is the very nature of expansion. The investment allowance has the very important function of encouraging efficiency in Australian industry, and of helping industry to make very difficult decisions. To give a typical example, an industry may be faced with the problem of retaining a relatively efficient machine with a productive capacity 25 per cent, greater than what it is currently producing, or of putting in a new piece of machinery with a productive capacity 100 per cent, greater. The new machine would make for greater efficiency and, what is of equal importance, it would reduce the unit cost. Ordinarily, it would be difficult for management to decide to take the risk because the capital cost of increasing capacity has to be amortized and spread over the unit cost of production. This bold step by the Government will help industry to make such decisions when confronted with this problem in individual plants. The day will come when we shall treasure this measure as a way of increasing our rate of production and of creating a bold, bustling type of private industry.. I believe that the fundamental issue in our future growth is stability. The time has come when the myth that a little mild inflation is not a bad thing has been destroyed. Inflation can only erode, it can only harm, it can only hold up development. Stability is the fundamental issue. That this Government has achieved stability is proved by reference to the consumer index over the last twelve months. Stabil it y is the fundamental thing which has to be looked to. It must be the foundation of all policy. If achieving stabil it y means short-term economic measures, then I, foi one, favour short term measures. If the very nature of the measure is such that it can be diverted, w it hdrawn, changed or varied, then the very fact that it has this flexibil it y makes me favour it . There was sent, I think to all honorable members of this House, a small booklet containing the final address delivered by Robert L. Garner, President of the International Finance Corporation and Vice-President of the World Bank. In delivering that speech, he had nothing to gain, and no purpose to serve other than to make a personal declaration of what his long international experience in finance and economic matters had taught him. He included all that in his address, and I suggest that it ought to be made compulsory reading for all honorable members of the Opposition.

[Quorum formed.] I am not so small that I would not apologize, if I were wrong. If my claim that we built Williamtown is wrong, I will apologize, but my information is that the new fighter base at Williamtown was established by this Government. We also established new strips at Avalon and other centres. Apart from work done in Australia with defence moneys over the last twelve years, we have established a complete air base on Cocos Island, with all the necessary equipment and air strips, and we have established a complete air base at Butterworth in Malaya. The honorable member for Newcastle is doubtless a great general. He and other Opposition members are so expert in defence matters that they would not consult those who have had many years of experience in this sphere. They do not agree that we should send troops to Malaya, although this helps to build up friendly relations with Malaya as well as giving us a front line. Their idea is that if we want to defend Newcastle, we should put the troops into Newcastle.  Let me mention some of the other establishments that have been built with defence moneys. We have the enormous and complex radar system at Brookvale which covers the industrial areas of Sydney and Newcastle. We have the radar establishment at Darwin and we have the mobile radar system. We have ground-to-air missiles and many - other items of equipment that are esssential to modern warfare. In what other way is the money spent? Does the Leader of the Opposition want to mislead the people into believing that our ships stay in port and our aircraft on the ground all day and the service personnel do nothing? Of course, there are constant bombing exercises and fighter interception exercises. These matters all concern the defence vote for which the Leader of the Opposition says we have nothing to show. In fact, we have a flexible and mobile defence force. In my own electorate, we have a stores depot and training centre at Bandiana. This depot holds millions of pounds worth of stores, but the public does not inspect that every day. I am reminded that Opposition members do not go there either; yet they say we have nothing to show for the money we have spent on defence! We have purchased 500 aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force over the last twelve years. We have bomber squadrons with Canberra aircraft, fighter squadrons with Sabre aircraft, maritime reconnaissance squadrons, transport squadrons, an airfield construction squadron and a ground-to-air guided weapons unit. We also have the prospect of very large and more modern aircraft arriving in the near future. Neptune aircraft and Bell helicopters are expected to arrive very soon. I do not think I have left the House or the people of Australia in any doubt as to whether the statements of the Leader of the Opposition can be relied upon in this matter. If the Opposition thinks that by moving these long-winded and vague amendments it will bluff any member of the team on this side of the House into crossing the floor to vote with it, it should think again. I say here and now that we realize this game is tough. We received almost as big a shock at the result of the election as the Opposition did, but the Opposition has not recovered from the shock yet. Perhaps we have not fully recovered, either, but we are getting over the shock more quickly than the Opposition is. We are forming ourselves into a keen, energetic and tough team that the Opposition will find impossible to beat.

Before the election, Government supporters accused Opposition members of talking about unemployment when it did not exist. They said that we were scaremongers, in the community and that we were trying to create a depression. I do not know whether the loss of fifteen members from the Government's ranks has brought its attention to this problem. Perhaps it realized that a lot of its former supporters in this place were out of work. Thinking about them, perhaps it realized that about 131,000 others were out of work, too. Having received a jolt in the election, the Government realizes that it must try to do something about unemployment, and it now attempts in a hurry to make in its programme a few changes that it hopes will restore some confidence to the people and carry it over for a time. Obviously, the Government does not expect the present situation to improve for a long time, as the Treasurer is busy intimating that this policy is flexible and that the Government will be prepared to change it rapidly, if necessary, as has been done in the past. That is no way to win back the confidence of the people of Australia. Manufacturers will not set about planning until they see that the Government controlling this Parliament and administering the country's affairs has a set programme for restoring the stability of the economy.  A fairly big manufacturer in my electorate asked me, after the Government's plans had been announced, what I thought of them. I said: ' I am glad that the Government realizes that there is a problem and that the unemployment position has to be rectified. No doubt, its housing programme at least will pick up a little.' The manufacturer replied: ' I would not trust them at all now. I have been caught too often. I will never forgive the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for deliberately creating unemployment in this country. They nearly sent me bankrupt, and I am not prepared to take a chance on them again. If my bank told me to-morrow that I could have any amount I wished on overdraft, I still could not trust the present crowd in office any longer.' That view plainly states the position that we in this country face to-day. The Government proposes to reduce the sales tax on motor cars. Does it think that such a reduction will make people rush out and buy new cars? Does it think that because a motor car is now Â£60 or Â£70 cheaper the motor industry will pick up overnight? Many business people, because of their commitments, need to buy a new car every two years or so, and some of them have been able to keep it up. Many private individuals buy a new car only at intervals of some years, and the wage earner, who is further down the line, generally buys on the used car market. The wage-earner cannot hope to buy a car, whether used or new, unless his employment is secure, not just for six months or one year, but for an extended period of years. Until this Government can assure him of that security, he cannot afford to buy a car or replace his existing one. Furthermore, business people will not continue to buy vehicles unless they can be assured of business coming in. If their business is not sure, they will make their existing vehicle last a year or so longer than the period of one or two years for which they usually keep a motor vehicle. The Government can restore confidence in the community only by giving an undertaking that its policy, whatever that policy may be, will be followed for a certain period. This Government must give the community something better than a promise of stopandgo - a promise that it will do one thing to-day but may do something different to-morrow. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell) in his amendment, which constitutes a motion of censure of the Government, has pin-pointed a number of matters in respect of which the Government has to answer to the people instead of contenting itself merely with attacking the Opposition. The Government ought to let us know why it has not done something about these matters that have been raised by the Opposition. We should be told what the Government proposes to do about the problem of unemployment, for unemployment constitutes a serious problem whether there are 131,000, 100,000, 50,000 or some smaller number of people unemployed. Unemployment is a very serious thing for all those who are out of work. Governments, regardless of their political colour, all have an obligation to provide full employment for the people. It is true that this Government has now made some move to stimulate home building, which it deliberately set out to halt earlier. The Government now proposes to make more liberal advances to ex-servicemen under the provisions of the War Service Homes Act, and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia has increased its maximum advance for home-building. But the provision of additional money fs not the real answer, because money borrowed has to be repaid. If the amount borrowed increases, the weekly payments become greater. There is a limit to what the wage earner is able to repay weekly. From whatever source a person borrows money, whether it be the War Service Homes Division or some other lending authority, he will still need Â£1,000 or more as a deposit on the purchase of a home. Many people in the community want homes. Many of the 131,000 persons who are unemployed want homes. The increase in the maximum loan will not help them at all. The Government, in co-operation with the States, ought to undertake a national programme really designed to increase home-building and to provide for the people the homes that are so much needed. I turn now to social services, Mr. Deputy Speaker. One could almost say that this Government cares little for Australia's children and their future and that it cares even less for those in this community who are aged and invalid. What is the position with respect to child endowment? The Government has done nothing about it. Why are not Government supporters honest enough to say whether or not they believe in child endowment.

On three occasions it has acted toÂ» contain or eliminate inflationary or boom conditions. In each case the objective was the .ame - the creation of the basic conditions in which maximum economic growth could take place. Our score was three all. The Opposition's score, on the other hand, has been six-nil. Not once did Opposition members hesitate. Not once in these three years did they deviate from the infallible panacea of all ills. It did not worry them that the environment in which each of these decisions was taken was different. The price of wool varied by over 30 per cent, in that period and our overseas reserves varied correspondingly. Opposition members did not worry that there was also such a thing as a margins case; that there was land speculation in one period and not in another; that the level of investment varied in accordance with tens of thousands of individual investment decisions by individual Arms; that the prospect of Britain entering the Common Market made it necessary for us to see that our economic decks were stripped and ready for action. No Sir! None of these variables, nor any of the others which entered into the Government's thinking, made any difference to the Opposition. The same prescription was put forward time after time. The six-nil score remained the same. Spend! Stimulate inflation, whatever the circumstances!  It reminds me of nothing so much as of those people who swear by a betting system. If they go on using it long enough the conditions are bound to arrive in which it will be successful. They will have a win - if they live long enough and if their money lasts out. So the Leader of the Opposition emerges, not as a messiah, but as a sort of super-punter, waiting for the conditions under which his system will provide the answer. It would be amusing if it were not tragic. It is about time that the honorable gentleman and his party realized that, unlike my mythical punters who risk only the future of their families, they are risking the livelihood, the security and the future happiness of 10,500,000 Australians by confusing punting with policy. Of course, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the honorable gentleman did not punt right this time. Being a fair-minded man, I will admit that he came closer to finding the conditions into which the universal prescription fitted than he had ever done before. It has been the same prescription, in September, November and now again in February and March. But conditions have changed. As the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) and the Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt) have pointed out, our loan raisings have been enormously successful. They have been about Â£90,000,000 more than was expected and have been more than enough to convert a planned budget deficit into a considerable surplus, with all that that means in depressive effects in circumstances which require the opposite policy - the policy laid down by the Government in its considered appraisement of the economic situation when it looked at the Budget last year. The Government, faced with the enormous success of its loan raising, seeing the depressive effect that this would have if the situation were not corrected, acted in accordance with its usual flexible policy and took the recent measures to correct the situation. It did this to ensure that, at the very least, the deficit planned in the Budget would prevail. Did the Leader of the Opposition who has been represented as an economic messiah predict that this would happen? Of course he did not. I have searched carefully through his budget speech, through his policy speech delivered during the general election campaign, and through the speech that he made on Tuesday night. I can find no reference to our loan raisings in this context at all - not a single, solitary reference! Yet loan raisings have varied by nearly as much as the mystical Â£100,000,000 that appears to be the talisman of Labour's hopes. Not only does the honorable gentleman stand condemned because he is a punter but also because he is always punting in the same direction - in the direction of continuing inflation. As my honorable friend from Wakefield (Mr. Kelly) pointed out in a really remarkable speech, on nothing is the Labour Party itself so deserving of censure as on its continued attempts to delude the public that the problem of inflation is not a problem at all. This is a process in which Opposition members aline themselves with the get-rich-quick boys, the speculators, the supporters of the milk bar economy and the people who cannot lift their eyes above the profits to be made in the present. These are the people to whom the Labour Party is giving comfort and solace and whose case Opposition members have made their own. In fact, Mr. Deputy Speaker, inflation is as great a problem as unemployment itself because it saps the moral fibre of the nation, distorts the economy and encourages people to believe that they can take it easy when some of the greatest challenges of the twentieth century are crowding in upon us. From one point of view, inflation is worse than unemployment, because by destroying the incentives of the great primary industries it destroys their capacity to provide the export income without which the manufacturing industries would not be able to keep going. This point of view is not original. It has been laboured time and time again by honorable gentlemen on this side of the House and has been expressed in the Government's policy. But it has always been treated with derision and contempt by honorable gentlemen opposite. As the honorable member for Wakefield said yesterday, the Opposition has a responsibility to tell the nation - particularly the farmers out in the great rural areas - where it stands on this issue. They will not do it, of course, because it does not suit their punting, inflationary policy. On the contrary, Labour would claw the proud, independent and efficient wool industry to its knees and prop it up purely with subsidies. That is all that the Labour Party has to offer to prevent the wool industry from collapsing altogether. That industry, with its vitality and vigour lost, would be pushed around by bureaucrats and petty Labour politicians who believe that Australia has reached its present greatness while its people have sat on the beach at Bondi. We have not attained greatness through a 35-hour week, or by pursuing policies which reduce the rewards of skill and encourage our citizens to sit passively by and let their sense of human and family responsibilities be destroyed by too great a dependence on the State. God forbid that advocates of such policies should ever get their clutching hands on to an industry whose resources, independence of mind and spirit, hard work and never-ending willingness to innovate have made it the very yardstick by which Australian achievement is judged. Such people, Sir, do not even remotely understand the value of those qualities which have made this country great. They are beyond their comprehension and because they do not understand, they would destroy this great industry. We should be censuring the Opposition - not it censuring us. We should be censuring it for its rigid, punting policies, for gambling with the prosperity, stability and future greatness of this country and for deliberately concealing the truth from the Australian people.

Why are they not honest about it? Why do they not tell the people that? Why sell out at election time and promise not to have any nationalization of industry? I will tell the Opposition why its leader sold out. He made a deal with Warwick Fairfax. He sold his soul to the capitalist press. He broke the pledge which he had made to uphold the federal constitution of the Labour Party. Anything at all to get into power!  What about our overseas balances? Opposition members say that the Government has not protected our overseas balances. Goodness me, let us look at the record! When we introduced our economic measures our overseas reserves amounted to Â£376,000,000. They now amount to Â£601,000,000, an increase of Â£225,000,000. There is the strength of the country. That is the result of our economic measures. That is why the Government has gained the confidence of foreign investors and migrants. That is a performance to be proud of. In the last seven months of the current financial year our trading balance has improved by Â£131,000,000. That is the best record for many years. Point 5 in the censure motion of the Leader of the Opposition is that the Government has overlooked family social services which would have a continuing social and economic benefit.

From the December quarter of 1949, when Labour left office, until the December quarter of 1961, the consumer index rose by 91 per cent. Yet age and invalid pensions have risen by 144 per cent. On top of that, the Government has given all the other benefits such as medical, hospital, and pharmaceutical. It has eased taxation and increased insurance allowances. Opposition members should not try to point the finger at us and say that we have not looked after these people. The proportion of national income paid in social service benefits has increased from 4.1 per cent, under the Labour Government to 5.7 per cent, in 1960-61. A much greater proportion of the national income is being spent on social services than ever before.  Point No. 6 of the Leader of the Opposition is that the Government has rejected the unanimous and urgent request of the Premiers for an inquiry into the needs of education. Here is a point that needs to be discussed. Only one Premier asked for an inquiry into the education system at the last Premiers' Conference. That was Mr. Heffron . At the last Premiers' Conference every Premier asked the Commonwealth to finance the plan that they put forward foi education in their States. But only Mr. Heffron asked for an inquiry into secondary and primary education. He could not get one other Premier to support him. Opposition members who are interjecting should make sure that they know the facts. This is the true story. The Opposition has moved a motion, hoping to bring down the Government by statements that are completely dishonest. Why do Opposition members not try to get their facts right when they seek to embarrass us? They will not embarrass us. Point 7 of the Leader of the Opposition's motion is that the Government has failed to reverse its three increases in interest on housing loans. This is an interesting point. It has nothing to do with the inadequacy of housing - the subject on which we have been attacked for years. Now, the Opposition has changed its approach in order to say that the interest rate is too high. Have we supplied enough houses? Is that why the Opposition has abandoned its previous line of attack? We are supplying more houses than the Labour Party promised to supply in its election policy speech. The honorable member for Indi (Mr. Holten) made a strong point this morning in reply to the honorable member for Wilmot (Mr. Duthie), who had said that the number of home units completed had decreased from 103,000 to 80,000.

Does the Labour Party not know that an inquiry has been taking place as a result of which a suggestion will be put to the Government and the industry concerning a marketing scheme? Do Opposition members expect the Government to say what should be done while an inquiry is taking place into the subject? Of course, the Labour Party would do that. But we will not. We want to get suggestions as a result of an inquiry. Then the industry itself will decide what sort of plan to adopt. In 1951 the industry rejected a plan which had been put forward. Now, the position is being re-examined to try to get more up-to-date ideas for presentation to the industry. The Labour Party is so devoid of knowledge of what is happening in primary industry that its members would not know that an inquiry was being held. Unfortunately, the report of the inquiry has taken a while to come out. I think honorable members know that the delay has been due to the unfortunate death of one member of the committee in an aeroplane crash.  Point No. 9 of the amendment is that the Government has given no assurance to the dairy, meat, wheat, sugar, fruit and other primary industries as to what action will be taken in the event of the United Kingdom being admitted to the European Economic Community. That is an interesting point. What assurance do Opposition members expect the Government to give? We do not know what the effects will be. Do honorable members opposite know what they will be? If they do, they did not make any statement during the election campaign as to what they would give the primary producers. They are blowing froth and bubble into the air. They are talking simply to try to get primary producers on their side. What have they done lately?

Prima facie, it is of great significance in this House, because an Opposition victory on this amendment would put Opposition members on this side of the, House as a government. To comprehend fully the seriousness of this debate, one has to analyse the background to this motion of censure. It dates back to the time, a week after the general election, when the Leader of the Opposition became quite hysterical at the prospect that his long-held ambition to become Prime Minister of Australia was about to be realized. His hysteria deepened when he realized that he had been denied this honour by the Government's victory by a narrow majority. However, this did not stop the honorable gentleman from making statements continually in print and on the radio and television. Indeed, Sir, he was irrepressible. He obliged the press at every turn. As a supporter of this Government, I thought that, had I been a member of the Labour Party at that stage, I would have been worried that the leader of that party was overplaying his hand very badly. I was proud, as a Government supporter, at the contrasting dignity and sportsmanship displayed by our leader .at that time.  We then heard the announcement that early in the first week of the session this attack on the Government would be made. But anti-climax followed. It was announced that the attack would be postponed. That announcement was followed by a process which I can describe now only as a softening-up process, which took place in the first week of ths session, supposedly for the purpose of keeping us in suspense. Well, we are engaged in politics, and we look forward to a fairly vigorous approach on the part of t-he Opposition. But what did we see? We saw me spectacle of the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) attacking the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Freeth) in a cowardly fashion and making scurrilous and disgusting charges, knowing full well that the Minister could not reply because he had already spoken in the debate in which those charges were made. Then we heard the self-confessed clown of the Opposition, the honorable member for Grayndler (Mr. Daly), deliver a speech which I, even in my short time here, have heard three times. That speech may have gone over well at a football club smoke social late in the evening when three-quarters of those present were in an advanced stage of inebriation, but I assure you, Mr. Speaker, that from where I sat it appeared to do no credit to the National Parliament at a time of national tension. Next, to make matters worse, we heard the honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Clyde Cameron), who is not noted for his tact in talking about matters relating to our Territory of Papua and New Guinea, make an almost unbelievable attack on the fine men who administer that Territory so courageously for Australia. ' Nitwits ' was the term that the honorable member applied to them. He implied that Australian officials in Papua and New Guinea had been guilty of cruelty and inhumanity. Doubtless he derived some satisfaction from the knowledge that he was suitably reported in the red China press. While this softening-up process was going on, we saw the redoubtable champion of red China, the honorable member for Reid (Mr. Uren), lounging in his seat in this chamber reading a book which, appropriately for him, was bound with a red cover. Occasionally, he nonchantly rose, without even looking round the chamber, and directed the attention of the Chair to the state of the House. All this was part of the softening-up process. ', Then, finally, the big day was at hand and along came the piece de resistance - the actual motion of censure launched by the Leader of the Opposition. We on this side of the House, not being politically naive, wondered what the basis of his motion would be. We all know his superb liaison with the press, and we had read in the press some time beforehand this statement - ","Suspension of Standing Orders","ADDRESS-IN-REPLY.","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[4]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Where do they stand? Is it any wonder that the electors would not return a Labour government? Is it any wonder that the electors made sure that there would be a majority on this side of the House?  The next thing that I want to know is this: Why have not all members of the Labour Party supported this censure motion? One of the strongest speakers on the Labour side in condemnation of the Government is usually the honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Clyde Cameron). There is a man who could handle a censure motion and who has done so before. Yet I have studied his speech and I cannot find in it anything about the censure motion. He sits on the Opposition front bench. He is a man who might be able to convince me, but he has said nothing at all about the censure motion. Many other members of the Opposition have done the same thing. Another point on which I seek information from the Labour Party is this: It is true that at the end of 1960 we had to introduce certain economic measures which the Labour Party now says harmed the commercial community. The people who, condemned the Government for those measures were the big business people and the so-called capitalists. Where does the Labour Party stand on this matter? By attacking the Government's measures, it has been supporting the businessmen and the capitalists. It has been supporting the people whom it is supposed to be against. Lest honorable members opposite get the wrong idea, let me say that in my view the Labour Party should have condemned, as 1 do now, the people who resisted, wilfully and unnecessarily, the economic policies introduced by the Government in 1960 to steady the. economy of this country. Instead of that, what did these business people do? They resorted to quite unnecessary retrenchments of staff and to goodness knows what else. This was quite unnecessary. But there was not a word about that from members of the Labour Party. Their attitude was dictated by purely political reasons. They saw an opportunity to make the Government unpopular. Never mind about the fellows who were out of work! So they took political advantage of the situation. I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition is not present because I wanted to say something about him. When the Labour Party has an opportunity to sabotage the economy of this country it will do so, regardless of the cost. My mind goes back to a period before 1949 when this country was in a chronic state, largely because of controls and restrictions under the Labour Government. There were shortages everywhere. Black marketing was the rule. ","Suspension of Standing Orders","ADDRESS-IN-REPLY.","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

We do not see them in the chamber very often; so when a quorum is called, some of them make an appearance and we know the Australian Labour Party is represented here. I was talking about the conditions which prevailed in 1951-52, which was a time of prospertiy. The country was flooded with money. Production could not keep pace with the demand. There was over-full employment and no talk of unemployment. We could not get an adequate work force.  To balance the economy and stop inflation, the Government appealed to the people to save their money. It warned them that: restrictive measures would have to be taken unless they acted reasonably. In such a time of national need, one would expect every member of this Parliament to be aware of his responsibilities to the nation. The honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) was then Deputy Leader of the Opposition and what did he do? He went to Adelaide and attended a meeting of workers. Instead of appealing to them to act reasonably in the circumstances, he said in effect, 'Spend all you can while you can. This will embarrass the MenziesFadden Government.' He ignored the fact that such a course might ruin the country. He and his party have been saboteurs of the national economy solely for political reasons. That was the support that the Government obtained from the Opposition. That is the sort of thing that goes on in the Labour Party. We get no co-operation from it. I wish to speak now on the subject of unemployment. The previous speaker, the honorable member for Oxley (Mr. Hayden), began his maiden speech by deploring personal references to other honorable members. He said it very sanctimoniously, and then he proceeded to do what he asked everybody else not to do. As he was delivering his maiden speech, he had the traditional protection accorded a new member in such circumstances. I congratulate him upon a highly provocative speech, but warn him that he will not get away with it under similar conditions in future. The honorable member referred to unemployment and then spoke about a 35-hour week for the workers. I remind members of the Opposition that the introduction of the shorter week we have now has contributed substantially to unemployment. Of course, the Opposition does not agree with me; but that is a fact. The honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) will agree that in Western Australia the Building Workers' Industrial Union is policing and picketing week-end work. Men who already have a full week's work are depriving others, who are out of work, of employment. These men do not care whether their fellows are on the breadline so long as they can get extra work at overtime rates. If honorable members opposite get a still shorter working week, there will be more unemployment because there will be too many people who will try to get two or three jobs. The Opposition's constant reference to 130,000 unemployed being registered for work leaves me quite unsatisfied. I made a check of the position, and any Commonwealth Employment Office will confirm the fact that it has registered for work wives whose husbands are working. The number of genuine workers, the breadwinners, who are seeking jobs is much less than 130,000. Anybody who allows his wife to take a job while he is working deprives a breadwinner of a job, and the numbers of registered unemployed are thus inflated. I would like the Opposition to cite the true figures and not fictitious figures. Then we would know where we stood. I was interested to hear the statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Whitlam) that the Governor-General's Speech did not contain any reference to the West New Guinea issue. He referred to the fact that the ' Hansard ' report contained a reference to this subject of only two or three lines. The honorable gentleman advanced that as an excuse why no reference was made to New Guinea in the Opposition's censure motion. I suggest to the honorable gentleman that he study the separately printed copy of the Governor-General's Speech. Surely a man of the honorable member's mental capacity can comprehend that all but two paragraphs on the first page of that copy refer to West New Guinea. If he cannot do so, he should have his head read. In the small paragraph that he has picked out, New Guinea is mentioned specifically; but apparently the honorable gentleman cannot comprehend the fact that practically the whole of the first page of the Speech relates to the tremendous importance that is attached to the West New Guinea issue. If he cannot understand' that, he is not qualified to occupy the position of Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

What is wrong with so many Opposition members? The week-end papers say that they are starry-eyed about the virtues of communism. They are what has been described in this House as left-wingers. What we do know about leftwingers of the Labour Party is that they have made some remarkable statements and have performed some remarkable actions. I know that when I raised the question of the persecution of Jews in Russia, with a request to the Government to raise the subject with the United Nations, with the exception of one man, Opposition members gave no encouragement whatever to the request. Members of the Labour Party rubbished the suggestion in another place. They went further and allowed a senior member of their party in this chamber to accuse the supreme leader of Australian Jewry of being a traitor to his faith and to his party. The only wrong he had committed was to defend, courageously and with great loyalty, Jewish people in Russia against persecution.  How could any friendly nation have confidence in a government composed of a party of unpredictable people who see virtue in those things that the free world opposes? The recent conference of the A.L.P., in Canberra, at which some people hoped to get a ban placed on the Northwest Cape project, is now legendary. The A.L.P. men came to Canberra from Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland resolutely opposed to the establishment of the Learmonth base, at the North-West Cape. They had the traditional ' defence is bunk' approach of die-hard leftism, and they thought they had the numbers. They, had, too, until one Queensland; delegate realized that there were electoral implications. Nothing else mattered to him. Australia's defence did not matter. He had probably read the new doctrine enunciated by President Oliver of the New South Wales branch of the A.L.P., who had said: ' We must welcome America as an ally'. He added coyly, ' Not to accept America as an ally, would be to commit political suicide '. You will notice, Mr. Speaker, that it was not a matter of principle, but a matter of political suicide that concerned him most. So one man switched to save the skin of eighteen others, and they all came tumbling after him. Sir, very simply, does not all this make you feel a bit sick? Does any one really believe that vital issues of principle can be made the currency of tawdry little fixes like this one? Is this the stuff of which national leadership is made? Is this the type of government that the people want? Is this the type of government that would start to-morrow if this want of confidence motion were won by the Labour Party? I think not. I do not want to refer to any further matters regarding that side of the issue because the domestic issues are uppermost in the minds of some people and I should like to follow my colleagues in making reference to them. The first signs to look for in any revival of public confidence are public spending, unemployment figures and immigration figures, as well as inflow of overseas capital. These are the great national policies of this Government and they will, I am sure, impress people if they take time enough to look at them. I submit that there is free spending in the community in most spheres to-day and there are signs that the taxpayer is resuming his buying habits with much more discrimination. That is a very healthy sign of a good economy. This is in marked contrast to what took place two years ago during a period of inflation. Over and above that, the gratifying thing about to-day's economy is the stability of costs and prices and the cost-of-living index, which has been steady over the last two years. If anybody doubts me in regard to that, he has only to refer to the ' Monthly Review of Business Statistics ' for January, 1963, or turn to the 'Treasury Information Bulletin ' Number 29, of January this year. From those documents he will see that what I say is true. Further, he might see the instalment credit figures, which are even more marked than those for the cost of living. Retail sales and instalment credit figures are to me most significant. They are very buoyant figures, and are even more important than the figures for the motor transport industry, because the figures for retail sales of goods cover such a wide range of goods. In other words, the sales of some commodities included in the retail figures must be high in order to take care of those that are of a lower level. 1 mentioned the motor transport industry. Most of us know that the rise in the figures for that industry was almost astronomical over the last eighteen months. Then I come to the unemployment figures. The last review of the unemployment situation at the end of February, 1963, made available by the Department of Social Services several weeks ago, showed that there was a fall of 15,765 in the number of persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. This reduced the total number of unemployed to 96,042 persons in all, males and females, or 2.2 per cent, of the work force of Australia. No one on this side of the House wants to say that is good enough, but it does show a strong trend towards full employment, and an infinitely better result - I repeat that remark; an infinitely better result - in employment figures, even at 2.2 per cent., than Labour ever had during its period of office. The Government Statistician tells us in his Labour Report for 1960 that during Labour's regime, under Mr. Chifley or Mr. Curtin, the lowest unemployment figure was 3.2 per cent.; and that was in 1947 when every man, woman and child had only to say they were available for a job and employers would rush them off their feet in a desire to place them on the payroll. I pass to the subject of immigration. One of the best outward signs of confidence that the people of one country can have in another country, is that they want to go to that other country and share in its prosperity. The people of overseas countries are prepared to sacrifice all that they have in their own country in order to start afresh in Australia. That is the position to-day. Immigration figures are strongly on the way up. Seldom in the history of this country have they appeared to be better. The 1962-63 target of 125,000 arrivals will be exceeded. There has been a tremendous flood of applications in Great Britain for assisted passages to Australia, and there is no reason why this trend should not continue. Many of the applicants are skilled and key workers of a type upon whom the expansion of our industries depends so heavily. It is already clear that the intake of British migrants in the twelve months ending 30th June next will be the best for the past ten years. The inflow of overseas capital is a very good indication of the confidence that overseas countries have in the Government of Australia. It is worthwhile reminding the Opposition, which desires to criticize the handling of the economy of this country by the Menzies Government, that the hippocket nerve is still the most sensitive of all nerves when it comes to gauging public confidence. It is a very good barometer. The tremendous interest manifested in the growth possibilities offered by Australia is emphasized by figures in the quarterly summary of Australian statistics for December last year. Leading executives of great overseas industrial investment houses have come lately to Australia, in large numbers, to assess the opportunities presented for the initiation and extension of their financial activities in Australia. They are impressed and they have come here to find out what is going on. Of course, they have read the statistical reports that have been made available to them by the Treasury in its information bulletins. I have no doubt they have read also one of the most highly conservative financial gazettes in the United Kingdom. I refer to an article which appeared in the ' Stock Exchange Gazette ' of London at the end of January this year. It was headed 'Australia - a Common Market Hedge', and it contained the following paragraph - ","N/A","WANT OF CONFIDENCE MOTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[7]/para[5]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Repeatedly, Opposition members have urged action on what really amounts to an infringement of Australian sovereignty. How can we effectively expand our export income in the manufacturing field when these hobbles restrict activities? Frightened of offending its powerful - that is, financially powerful - friends, this Liberal-Country Party Government stands idly by. Surely this is another indictment to add to the overwhelming evidence that it is time for a change to a Labour government.  I want to turn to one branch of primary industry in which government inactivity has endangered the livelihood of many Australians. More than six months ago I initiated a debate on the poultry industry as a matter of urgency. For egg-producers little has changed since then. Action to stabilize the industry is still an urgent necessity. Over the past eighteen months returns to egg-producers have slumped to levels lower than for a decade. Many eggproducers have left the industry, being literally starved out of it and losing their life's savings. Some are deeply in debt. Some go out to work, leaving their families to work the farms; whilst some receive the only governmental assistance available to them, namely, the unemployment benefit. So great is the disorganization in the industry that State egg boards handle less than 50 per cent, of Australia's consumption. Border-hopping, under the protection of section 92 of the Constitution, is a practice engaging whole fleets of transports. The producers who participate in it evade the payment of the equalization levy or pool charge which enables the egg boards to make up the losses incurred on overseas sales. As conditions have progressively worsened in recent months, and as this Government has stood by, desperation has driven many more producers to that practice.

I invite the House to do what the people will do and that is to regard the economic issues in the light of the vote of nineteen to seventeen in the federal conference of the Australian Labour Party. Do not think that I am trying to emphasize a point that is not important. I make these remarks with some regret. This point is important; it is most significant and to any Australian it is an infinitely disturbing point, not only on the economic issues, but also on the far more important issue of our national security.

During its term of office this Government has gone a long way towards achieving that objective, so much so that now well over 70 per cent, of homes are either owned outright or are in the process of being purchased by their occupants. I am glad that the Opposition now agrees basically with this ideal. It was very nice to learn from the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Whitlam) that he realizes the importance of home ownership; and it is pleasing that the Opposition now is getting away from Mr. Dedman's idea that home ownership creates little capitalists. [Quorum formed.] I thank the honorable member for Grayndler for his kindness in getting me an audience. I am glad that many Opposition members now are beginning to realize the value of home ownership. I hope that eventually they will come to recognize the other virtues of a property-owning democracy and also the wisdom of the ideals that we on this side have advocated for so many years. We believe also that the burden of repayments and interest rates should not be too high. That is one of the matters to which we have addressed ourselves during this debate.  Now I come to the question of responsibility for housing. This aspect was dealt with very well by my friend, the honorable member for Deakin (Mr. Davis), in his speech last Thursday. I only want to echo his remarks and point to the wisdom of them. I have always believed that the Commonwealth Government should have no responsibility for housing. I believe that housing is the responsibility of the State governments. All that we should do is help the State governments to overcome the many difficulties which confront them. If the Commonwealth cannot hand over its share of the responsibility in this matter then it should assume complete responsibility. There are ways in which the Commonwealth can assist the States to tackle the task, but the responsibility should remain with the State governments and with private enterprise. During the debate two schemes have been proposed. We have been told that the Commonwealth should inaugurate a scheme similar to that under which the Federal Housing Authority in the United States of America operates. Several honorable members on this side of the chamber have advanced that proposal and their remarks have been endorsed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. My own belief is that it would be better to encourage the savings banks to increase their lending for homes and, if possible, to rely on the savings banks as the main source of this finance. They have been the traditional source of finance for housing for many years. An organization similar io the American Federal Housing Authority would be something novel and would mean setting up another department. Our first task should be to learn whether the savings banks can do the job themselves without establishing an additional authority. I was tremendously pleased to learn that the Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt), is considering altering the so-called 70-30 rule relating to the investment by savings banks of their funds. If the proportion of savings bank deposits which can be made available for housing loans were increased by, say, 3 or 4 per cent., we would go a long way towards providing sufficient funds for housing. I hope that the Treasurer will soon conclude his deliberations on this subject and have some further information for the House on it. There is, however, one feature of the Federal Housing Authority scheme in America that I think is important - the provision of a mortgage exchange. I believe that we need some way in which mortgages can be negotiable, and can be exchanged, so as to encourage more people to lend money on first mortgages for homes. If we adopted these two improvements - the mortgage exchange and an alteration in the 70/30 proportion in regard to the utilization of savings banks funds - I think we should go a long way towards eliminating the present shortage of finance for homes in this country. The other factor that is important is the present high cost of homes in Australia. This matter was ably dealt with by the honorable member for Latrobe (Mr. Jess) in his speech. The first of several important points he dealt with was the need for the State governments to provide finance for services for land subdivisions. He showed how finance provided at high interest rates for services on land subdivided for housing increases the cost of the land. I believe that this is fundamentally a task for the State governments - a task which most of them have neglected during the past few years. It is time that the State governments accepted this responsibility and increased their expenditure on public works, particularly for the provision of services for land newly subdivided for housing. If we can lower the cost of land, if we can reduce the interest burden on loans by increasing the proportion of loans for housing advanced by savings banks, if we can facilitate tha raising of money on mortgages by making mortgages more liquid and negotiable, I believe we shall be able to see our way clear to reducing the need for Commonwealth loans. We should then not need to raise so much money in Commonwealth loans, and we would be able to reduce the allocations by the Commonwealth Government to the States for housing purposes. As the honorable member for Balaclava (Mr. Whittorn) has said, the housing problem does not arise purely from any lack in the building industry itself. It is the need to provide finance for housing at reasonable rates of interest which is important, as well as the need to reduce costs that are being borne to a great extent because in many oases the State governments have neglected their responsibilities. I turn now to the need for a steady building rate and elimination of the fluctuations from year to year in the number of houses being built. This was referred to to-night by the honorable member for Bass (Mr. Barnard). One element necessary to increase the rate of home building is the provision of more skilled operatives in the building trade. There are very few skilled building operatives unemployed in Australia at present.

The honorable member for Bass mentioned that 94,000 homes were completed in 1960, whereas the actual number completed exceeded that number by 7i per cent. The actual number of homes completed in 1960 was well over 100,000. This illustrates the need to use two figures - the number of homes recorded as built and the actual number built - and the need for any survey that may be carried out to ascertain more accurately the number of homes actually built and the reasons for the discrepancy in the statistics.  It is important that we should inquire into the source of finance for housing, particularly the way in which private funds are raised. We need to know how many people, when they sell existing homes, use the money to buy new homes. Much has been said here about the building of new homes, but we do not know anything about the movement in the ownership of existing homes. We know that large funds are provided by solicitors and other persons, and by organizations and companies, for housing but we have reason to believe that those funds could be increased considerably if the mortgages were made more easily negotiable.

One or two of them continue with the nonsense that if the party goes further left or is redder it will win elections. The result of the election was not expected by Labour. Before the election we saw a party that was just waiting to take office. Opposition members were eager and excited at the prospect of winning. Now they have long faces; they are hopeless and dejected.  They are out in the wilderness and the probability is that they will stay there for a long time. They will stay there until they listen to sensible suggestions and learn the lesson that can be found in the votes. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition made a mistake in Brisbane during the election campaign. I do not know whether he meant to do it. He was asked a set question by Mr. Keeffe about what would happen in future elections. He did not expect the answer he received. The Leader of the Opposition said, ' We will abolish preferential voting in Australia'. The people were presented with the prospect of Labour being in office for ever. That brick that the honorable gentleman dropped must have had a tremendous effect on the people of Australia. Weeks before the policy speeches were delivered, to my surprise, we were told in New South Wales by various people: ' We are Labour voters but we will not vote for the federal executive of the Australian Labour Party. We do not mind advice but we will not accept instructions.' Yet we still hear the spokesmen for Labour say that the 36 men represent the concentrated and thoughtful views of 2,500,000 people in Australia. When these people hear some of the statements of the executive, they react in two different ways. One small group keeps the patter going. The people in this group do not understand the implications or the dangers inherent in the statements, but they keep on repeating them. They imagine that the people in their trade unions are following them slavishly, but, of course, this is a shocking mistake and it became apparent at the election. <')n the other hand, the great mass of trade unions- ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[4]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

During the last four sitting days I have been fascinated to discover an almost concerted plan by Opposition members, egged on a little, if I may say so to my old friend, by a speech from this side of the House, to talk about gerrymandering the electorate. 'Gerrymander' is a beautiful word. It hails from America and it has a resonance in it. It is intelligible in English, so it is used. The Opposition claims that what we propose to do about the Commonwealth Electoral Act represents a gerrymander. I would have ignored this had it been just a passing exercise on the part of one honorable member but I suppose about ten honorable members opposite have claimed that we are proposing to gerrymander the electorate. Fortunately for us, and fortunately for Australia, most of them have explained what they mean by the word. As I understand it - I speak subject to correction, because I am always willing to be corrected - they mean one vote, one value. They claim that there must be no discrimination between a large widespread rural electorate like Kalgoorlie or a compact metropolitan electorate like my own. There must be no discrimination because the moment you depart from the principle of one vote, one value, this is a gerrymander. I know that my friend the honorable member for Leichhardt (Mr. Fulton) treats the statements of his colleagues with a certain amount of congenial contempt, but this apparently is the new Labour doctrine. The Labour Party has been in office in the Commonwealth for seventeen years altogether, perhaps not long enough from its own point of view. The Electoral Act of the Commonwealth of Australia first became law 62 years ago in 1902 - 62 years ago! I was so cut to the quick by all this talk about gerrymandering that I put myself to a little trouble and said to my officer, ' Bring me the 1902 Commonwealth Electoral Act'. Here it is. It is 62 years old, give or take a month or two. Section 16 of the act states -  ","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH.","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[2]/para[27]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

There is not a shadow of doubt that the use of such gas is a far better method of trying to deal with the situation that exists. It is a temporary measure that will not harm the local population but will enable the forces to achieve their objective. What is the use of slaughtering people? Does the honorable member think it is better to drop an anti-personnel fragmentation bomb on an area, or to use riot gas? Who is the judge of this? If other Opposition members wish gas not to be used in this case I should say that they are indeed the blood-thirsty ones, the blood seekers, be cause this in .the circumstances was a humane method.  As official reports come through on this type of action it is of no use for people in this House to try to drag the agony out just because gas has been used. The word ' gas ' has become a work of horror to all of us. We dislike the mere mention of it. But let us not be blinded by a ghost. There was a cartoon published recently showing Hitler's ghost labelled ' Gas.' Let us not be blinded sentimentality. From the evidence we have before us, the use of gas in this area was, as far as we can see, humane. Until we have reliable evidence to the contrary - and that evidence will certainly not come from the ' Daily Mirror ' or any other wrung-out bit of sentimentality of this nature - we must give the American Army and the American Government some credit for adopting a more humane type of attack than would otherwise have been the case. I should like to deal briefly also with one or two remarks of the honorable member for Wills (Mr. Bryant). Much to my amazement the honorable member succeeded in re-hashing - as indeed did the honorable member for Reid (Mr. Uren) - the argument in favour of negotiating for peace. I do not blame any honorable member for arguing in favour of negotiation. That is right and proper thinking; but surely honorable members were tremendously impressed with the speech of the honorable member for Fremantle. If honorable members opposite did not like it I do not mind if they send him over to this side of the House.

By so doing we would have to implement the Vernon report irrespective of current conditions. I mention as an illustration the recent drought in Queensland and New South Wales. Under his proposition there would be no room to enable the State or Commonwealth Governments to provide assistance. I heard an Opposition member interject that there would be no drought.

What do they want? Are they prepared to let Australia fall? Of course Australia has a bigger interest in South East Asia than the United States of America has. After all, what is America doing there? She is looking after our interests and the interests of the free countries of the world. Having regard to the contribution being made by the United States, I think it is only right for the Government to increase our commitment from 1,500 troops to 4,500. Even allowing for the differences in population or on a pro rata basis, United States troops in South Vietnam outnumber Australian by 12 to 1. We have a responsibility to play our part in this area. After all, if the war in South East Asia extends it will be in the direction of Australia and the closer it comes to our shores the more problems we will face. From time to time the Leader of the Opposition has said that the conflict in South Vietnam is a job for the United Nations. Does he suggest that the United Nations should jump in and offer its services in the form of troops? Is so, what countries would supply the troops? It cannot be forgotten that we are a member of the United Nations.  I turn now to national service training. I agree with national service training but, like many other honorable members, I do not like the ballot system. I think objection to the ballot is fairly widespread but what is the alternative if you require only a limited number of men? Other countries have faced a similar problem. Most of them lay down a hard and fast rule of calling up everybody. Undoubtedly there are plenty of anomalies associated with the ballot system where, simply on the luck of the draw, one man is exempt from call up and another suffers hardship by reason of being called up and having to serve his time. I would draw attention particularly to the position of twins. I have raised this matter on other occasions in this chamber and with officers of the Department of Labour and National Service and with the Minister for Labour and National Service. Under the present system, it is possible to have two or three members of one family serving at the one time. It seems a little unfair in the case of twins that both should be called up when their neighbour in the appropriate age group is not called up. In one case that I know of the twins, having been called up, tossed a coin to see who would apply for deferment. In due course, the winner of the toss applied for and obtained deferment. In another case, one of the twins was working on a farm. He may have considered that his work was of a little more importance than that of his twin brother. He automatically applied to have his call up deferred. The magistrate granted him deferment of four months only. His position is now due for revision. It seems to me that the two cases I have mentioned are identical. However, in one case a magistrate unhesitatingly granted 12 months' deferment while in the other case there was a lot of doubt as to whether 4 months deferment could be granted. I submit that in cases such as these there should be a right of appeal, as there is in the field of repatriation, where an applicant has available to him two appeals. I do not know that two avenues of appeal are necessary in these cases but where a young man feels that he is suffering hardship by being called up and unsuccessfully seeks to have his call up deferred by a magistrate, he should have the right of appeal. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister's announcement about rural finance. I congratulate the Government on its decision to make $50 million available for rural finance. At first glance this appears to be a substantial amount, but we must remember that we are talking in dollars and not pounds. It is only Â£25 million and, having regard to the ravages of the drought in some parts of Australia, I do not think Â£25 million will go very far. One hopes that this amount is only an instalment. We know that for some time the Commonwealth Development Bank has been very cooperative and that its efforts have been crowned with success, but in my opinion the terms under which loans are made by the Bank are a bit on the tough side. This is no doubt due to the Bank's shortage of finance. I was pleased to hear the Treasurer (Mr. McMahon) tell me in answer to a question yesterday that the Bank's long term loans would be over a period of 15 years or more. So often the expression ' long term ' means a period of fewer than 15 years. It is now up to the Bank to decide on rates of interest. Many people are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the conference to be held later today between the Treasurer and representatives of the banks. I was pleased to hear the announcement that our immigration laws are to be changed. I think members of all political parties represented in this Parliament agree that our immigration policy must work to Australia's advantage in the long term. Australia has no real racial problems. Not many countries can say that they have no racial problems. One recalls the disturbances in the United States and what has happened in the United Kingdom, the African States and South East Asia. No doubt many of the problems that now arise in these countries could have been avoided if the right action had been taken years ago. We in Australia enjoy many advantages over other countries. We have room to expand. There is plenty of room for an increased population. There is scope to increase our food production. We have the privilege of living in a country with a predominantly homogenous population. I think I speak for almost everybody in Australia when I say that we do not support discrimination except when it is to the advantage of the people concerned. Our present policy in this regard must be maintained at all costs. The Government has announced that non-Europeans in this country may apply for naturalisation after five years residence. Hitherto the residential qualification was 15 years. This relaxation of the residential qualification will remove one of the barriers which these people faced. It has been welcomed by many of them. But the picture is not all rosy. Some of the other aspects of our immigration policy announced by the Prime Minister will not be received altogether as favorably in some countries as we would have hoped. To my mind, any alteration in our immigration laws that would increase the number of people who would not be able to be integrated into our way of life would be a very dangerous move indeed. I would always oppose any move that I thought would encourage entry to Australia of the type of people who, in their turn, would encourage discrimination. This could only lead to more discrimination in the long run. I welcome the opportunity to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr. Harold Holt) on his first speech in this House as Prime Minister of Australia and to say that I wish him well. May he be spared to hold that position for many years to come. ","Ministerial Statement","GOVERNMENT POLICY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[5]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

As a result, there is too little evidence of solid support for our troops and our diplomacy overseas. Divisions exist today where they ought not to exist. Our enemies are far advanced in the old Communist technique of divide and conquer. It is not enough for those of us on these benches and our own supporters to believe that what we are doing is right. There ought to be in Australia's interest substantial agreement at least on matters of principle from a majority of the Australian people and from Opposition members. This is an issue as crucial for Australia as any in 1914 or 1939, whether war is technically declared or not. Yet it is unhappily true that, across the nation in churches, universities, trade unions and elsewhere, vociferous minorities are opposed to our fundamental objectives. There is room to fear that a change of government, if it could take place, would revoke our whole strategic position in South East Asia and our basic principles of defence.  It is no comfort to know that the most virulent opposition can almost always be traced fairly and squarely to the Communists. The enemy's ' Fronts ' have done an assiduous job. There are even leading churchmen today who have lived cheek by jowl with the Communists for years and have spearheaded their most obvious subversive fronts. This is true also of our schools and universities. The Communist influence is very significant in the Teachers' Federation in New South Wales. In the universities there are professors and lecturers who openly challenge the basic principles of the Australian society. We have men like that unfortunate individual Alex Carey who was seen recently on television attacking the Christian basis of the institution of marriage and sexual continence. On another front, misguided and otherwise decent women follow the Red line in the Save Our Sons movement. It is not enough for the trumpet to have a certain sound, if it calls to an uncertain and divided nation. Australia at this moment is in no immediate military danger. The Government does not claim that it is. But Australia is clearly vitally concerned if it sees a net beginning to close around it, even if it should remain far off at this stage. Yet the extension of our defence to meet this obvious, declared and self confessed strategy of our enemies is, I believe, not sufficiently understood nor is it backed by many sectors of the nation from whom we have the right to expect backing. Before we proceed much further, we must work for great changes. Let me emphasise some of the reasons why I believe this is so and give some of the factors that are giving comfort to and playing into the hands of our enemies. The first is obvious. It is the sense of Australian isolation. Asia is still remote to many Australians. Then there is the aspect of our prosperity. We have come so far so well and every day turns up new evidence of the wealth inside our borders that is there to be enjoyed. Our sport, our beaches, our money and our gadgets are ever present and we will not easily turn from them to the stark, bloody realities of the terror that lurks in the jungles to our north. But only a fool goes on painting his cabin in a sinking ship. Then too there are the widespread changes in the patterns of personal behaviour and discipline, especially as a result of two world wars and the failure of religion to translate its message into realities consonant with this scientific age. Can anyone argue with the basic thesis that directly as the individual's moral responsibility diminishes so controls must be instituted? The more dishonest the people are the more policemen are required. There is only one alternative to the rejection of the freely accepted disciplines of individual morality, in the widest sense of that word, and that is dictatorial control, and the Communists know this. Elementary Communist strategy is to undermine authority - moral authority in the community, the authority of parents, the authority of churches and governments - and out of the ensuing anarchy to seize control. This breakdown is being deliberately nurtured in our society today. Governments feel impotent or are unable to intervene because to do so is unpopular. This is politics. The need is first to convince enough people that things have to change. A strong and reasonable voice must point out the alternatives to the people, who in a democracy make or break governments. There is no other way. There is a widespread cynicism and nihilism today which brings together in a common cause pacifists, leftist protestants, some intellectuals, and the promoters of the Communist fronts. The fundamental principle of this movement - if I can call it that - is that staying alive is more important than how one lives. So we see leftist parsons who have succumbed to the humanism of Communism and with it their whole strategy of the conquest of Asia. I know leading preachers who have in turn bitterly attacked the South East Asia Treaty Organisation, conducted almost frenzied opposition to our troops going to Malaysia to help Britain defeat the Communist terrorists and have tried to persuade me that the documents in the Petrov affair were forged by our own security agents. More recently they have deplored our opposition to Indonesian aggression. They are now busily organising against our involvement in Vietnam. However, there is one other factor which is of great importance to our nation today, and that is the sorry story of Her Majesty's Opposition. Headed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell) we have had from it little other than sheer, negative partisan criticism of every aspect of the Government's action. This has led to a situation which, at present, is downright dangerous. For example, while the Prime Minister was speaking, one was confronted with the astonishing and disturbing spectacle of an increasing number of interjections and jeers from the Opposition whenever mention was made of Communist aggression in South East Asia. Was this because the majority of honorable members opposite are Communists or Communist sympathisers? Far from it. Not for one moment do I think so. But they have been outmanoeuvred. They have been outmanoeuvred, because of lack of leadership and because of lack of courage and content in their debating, into a dangerous position. Indeed, one wonders how many honorable members opposite realise that we are in the midst of a situation which has a deadly import for the future of the nation. Are they really trying to think and act as an alternative government acceptable to the people of Australia, or are they fomenting and giving momentary lip service to a cause because it is opposition? Do they see that their public attitudes are crystallising into what may well endanger the nation, and that they are in peril of sneering themselves into comforting and supporting the enemy - into de facto treason? In many cases this is, to me, deeply disappointing. I appeal most earnestly to those honorable members opposite who reject Communist principles and who stand for the value and rights of the individual - of the small as well as of the large societies - to search their hearts and their consciences as to how long they can permit to continue this blanket opposition of all that the Government is doing. I believe there are many honorable members opposite who would welcome an opportunity to provide exactly the kind of forthright, challenging but constructive criticism of this Government's activities in South East Asia that the nation has the right to expect. It is not a sign 0, weakness to find areas of agreement, but it is childish, unthinking and dangerous to oppose utterly for the sake of opposition - some of them even getting the substance of their opposition from enemy propaganda. I turn briefly to the largest issue before us at the moment, namely, the sending of extra troops, including national servicemen, to fight in Vietnam. This question has been deeply in all our minds for a long time. For Australia's sake I believe it should be more than a party issue. Surely the facts are clear and inescapable. Let me state my own conviction concerning it. I believe deeply, although sadly, that we must fight Communist aggression in Vietnam. I believe we must fight Communist aggression wherever it is found, particularly in South East Asia. That there is Communist aggression no-one in his right mind can deny. We must fight Communist aggression in Vietnam because this course is basic to the ultimate defence of Australia. Peace in the largest sense of the word - world peace - may well hang on the firmness with which we and our friends meet this situation, just as it has in Korea, Cuba, Berlin and elsewhere. There is no precedent in the 1914 situation or the 1939 situation for the course that we must now take. Let us take one example. We are winning - and I use the word ' winning ' in the ideological sense - in the situation in the Malaysian-Indonesian area because we are fighting the Indonesians on the one hand and are sending them aid on the other. Honorable members may suggest that this is crazy and illogical. Maybe it is; maybe it is not. However, it is right. To insist on the old classical concept of declaration of war in Vietnam could lose us the most precious objectives, as it would have done in Indonesia, where it would have been totally wrong. Nonetheless, we are at war. Forget Vietnam for a moment and listen to Mao Tse-tung, or to Chou En-lai while he was in Indonesia. This is not a time for semantics, but a time for stark realities and for meeting revolutionary war at all its levels - in the jungle, in the headlines and in the minds of men and women. We must, as a nation, to the utmost of our resources, bring to bear as needed the most adequate forces we can muster. If that requires conscription, and it does, then we must have conscription. Does anyone in his senses for om moment imagine that the Government is doing this because it thinks it is popular and will win votes? Does anyone think the Government is doing it because it brings some personal aggrandisement to its members? Australian isolationism and individualism recoil from the discipline of compulsion. We know it would be easy to leave it to the willing few and let it go at that, but the few are not enough. Our allies, the United States of America and others, and, of course, all our enemies, have long since left behind the merely volunteer system. In any case, why should volunteers be asked to fight out there and leave the long haired beach boys to face nothing more dangerous than sunburn? This responsibility is something for all Australian youths or for none. All Australians must face up to this. This is my conviction, but the Australian nation is not yet sufficiently persuaded of it. I believe that we have solid and sincere political work to do. This is the job of patriots opposite, as much as it is for honorable members on this side of the House. If it is not, let them convince us of a constructive and better way. There are two claims of the Opposition that make some sense to me, and I know make sense to a lot of other Australians, and I turn to them now to illustrate how seriously I have tried to look for sense in what the Opposition has said. The first claim is that the burden must not be left on the shoulders of a limited few 20 year old men. The second is that we should review our economic relations with mainland China. Obviously if we can take only 8,400 to 80,000 men for training in military service, then selection by ballot is fair enough, but we ought to require at least something extra from the other 70,000 or so. I know that university training and other training is desperately needed in Australia, but every young man at a university could do one night a week of military training or other form of national service training without harming his prospects as a student. Far beyond this 20 year age group, however, there are other burdens to be borne by the community. It is difficult to see what measures should be taken by the rest of the community, apart from financial ones. We have a race with time in developing the nation. This is the integral part of national security. Nevertheless, I believe it is incumbent on the Government at this stage to take another and very close look at some of the luxury and unproductive industries in the community where precious manpower resources are being squandered at a time when manpower is desperately needed. There is a whole range of such industries and activities where financial and other pressures could be brought to bear, directly or indirectly, by the Government to enable us to have more manpower available for production. As for trading with Red China, I repeat again the arguments about Indonesia. We are winning, ideologically speaking, partly because we have refused to over simplify the situation. A declaration of war would have unified Indonesia against us at a time when we were desperately needed to supply the people there with goods. Our activities are paying off. At first sight this appears to be double dealing - keeping doors open at all costs, despite provocation - but it is the right action. The case of Red China is not an exact parallel, but we are out to encourage friendly developments in that country at the same time as we try to deter aggression. However, we must not be lured by greed into economic dependence or near dependence on Red markets, only to find that the basic approach of the Communists to trade is ideological and not for profit. I think it was Lenin who scoffed that the love of profit would lead the West into financing its own destruction. I appeal to the Government to take another long and hard look at our trade with China, because expediency alone is not enough. It is at best a dubious argument to say that we need the overseas exchange to finance our defence build up. Butter for guns, lt is a hard bit of logic to maintain before many audiences. I am delighted to know that the Prime Minister is soon to visit Vietnam and South East Asia. I hope that he will go there often. I hope that more and more of us from both sides of the House will go there more often. I hope that our diplomatic activity in this area will be greatly extended. 1 hope that we will turn to Indonesia as soon as possible with vastly increased offers of help. As soon as our troops can be brought back from Borneo it may be possible to obviate the necessity to send men under compulsion of any kind for service abroad, at least until we have got much further in all the difficult areas I have enumerated. In this task we will need the support of every man and woman of goodwill in the nation, especially in the areas of Press, radio and television, where most are already doing a fine job. I am not asking that the Government be spared criticism. I am asking many sectors of the nation to make some basic decisions about what is happening in the world, particularly in our part of it. Having made those basic decisions we must do everything possible to advance our fundamental national cause in the best possible way. Let us win this struggle, as we can and must. This thing is too big to be a party measure. It would be dangerous if it became a party measure. It is too big for selfish neutralism and isolationism. I am fully behind the Government's decision that with our allies - British, American and Asian - we will halt armed aggression in Vietnam, Borneo and Malaya and anywhere else it is unleashed in South East Asia. If we are firm, resolute and united we can win that most valuable of allies - time for change. That is the hope of our age - that we may be able to contain Chinese aggression until China learns, as Russia is learning, that peaceful coexistence is not only possible but imperative for the survival of mankind. Only a united Australia is an adequate basis for building that peace in. South East Asia.

This, 1 believe, is the basis of the real difference between the Opposition and ourselves. I suspect that Opposition members say that the situation in Vietnam is no threat to us and, therefore, we do not need to do anything about it. But the best description of what is happening in South Vietnam is still to be found in the words of the British Socialist Foreign Secretary, Michael Stewart. It was he, among others, who pointed out that it was North Vietnam in 1959 and 1960 which made the decision to resurrect the Vietcong terrorist movement to overthrow by terrorism and subversion the governments of South Vietnam. He devoted some time to the methods of the Vietcong. He pointed out that, in 1963, 2,000 unarmed civilians - men, women and children - were murdered and that in 1964 that figure had risen to 2,800. He made it clear that this is not just or mainly a civil war; it is basically a war of aggression by North Vietnam, supported and supplied by China, against South Vietnam.  If the North Vietnamese regiments and the Chinese war materials moved by one stroke across the borders from the North to the South or down the Ho Chi Minh trail through Laos, there is not a person who could get on his feet and deny that this was plain, open, old fashioned aggression; but because the material and the regiments are infiltrated in over a period of time, quite slowly, over weeks and months and even years, there are people who get up and try to say that this is a civil war and nothing else. This, again, makes it difficult to understand that we no longer have the easy divisions between peace and war that were prevalent before 1939. Nobody can say that we or the world exist in a state of peace, but we are not at war in the full and complete sense as we were from 1939 to 1945. There are states between war and peace. This seems to be the normal circumstance for the world at present. The Australian Government can develop and test its policies in this matter only against the facts of what is happening in South Vietnam; not as we believe them to be, not as somebody suspects them to be, but as we know them to be. These are the facts which honorable members opposite would deny. I think it should be pointed out that we have had considerable verification of the situation from our own people - from members of the Army training team in Vietnam who work with the Vietnamese in every corner of the country. I am referring not to a battalion, but to our training team, the members of which work in ones and twos with the Vietnamese. We have diplomatic sources, friends and intelligence sources. They all support the Government's view of the nature of the aggression from North Vietnam against South Vietnam. If we want to examine the types of policy that Australia could pursue, having some agreement on the facts - an agreement which I think the Opposition would deny - there are only two policies that we could pursue. They are involvement in South East Asia or a policy of neutrality or non-alignment. I would have thought that most of us would now have come to understand, especially since India's experience of attack by China, that neutrality or non-alignment will not ever be a guarantee against attack or immunity from aggression. If honorable members opposite are really arguing that we should have a policy of neutrality or non-alignment - the honorable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) is the only honorable member opposite who has said so but it is the implication of everything honorable members opposite say - they should come out and say it in blunt terms. They should examine the effect of such a policy on South East Asia, the United States and the United Kingdom and on the actions of those countries in this part of the world. There is not the slightest doubt that a policy of neutrality or non-alignment on Australia's part would cause great dismay in South Vietnam and in Thailand, already the subject of infiltration by Chinese instigated and trained people. A Thai liberation front has been set up and it has been said by the Chinese that once the war in Vietnam is over attention will be turned to Thailand. There would be dismay in Malaysia. In the 1950's when Malaya was under Communist attack, the Opposition stood against our commitment there. Honorable members opposite at that time said very many of the same things they are now saying against our obligation and commitment in South Vietnam. They were proved wrong over Malaya and I believe they will be proved wrong over South Vietnam. We should also look at the effect of a policy of neutrality, not only on South East Asia but also on the United States of America and the United Kingdom. I believe that the effect on both countries would be identical. Non-alignment would mean that we would not help the United States and the Government of South Vietnam in South Vietnam. We would not help the British and the Malaysians against Indonesian confrontation. Under those circumstances, the people who cry for withdrawal of the British forces from east of Suez and the few members of the United States Senate who seem tb imply that the United States should not be involved in South East Asia would be enormously strengthened. They would be able to say: ' Look at Australia, a country like ours, with the same kind of traditions and way of life. They are not concerned about a possible downward thrust by China. They are not assisting us in trying to contain that thrust'. As late as last May, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell) said that China had to be stopped. But if the critics of the policies of the United States of America and the United Kingdom at this time could point to an Australia that was completely unconcerned about these matters and playing no part in them, I believe that the movements for withdrawal of both the United States and the United Kingdom from this area could well become irresistible with disastrous results for the whole region. This would leave us alone in a dangerous and difficult part of the world. If we are indifferent to the independence of other small nations, there may well be a time when someone will be indifferent to our fate. lt is now well recognised that in recent times the centre of the world power struggle has shifted from Europe to Asia. But how often must Opposition members be given the lessons that have been learned with such difficulty so many times? In the years since 1945, the Western world has been tested at least four times and has relied on the help that America has given. America gave Greece help against the Greek Communist movement that had been directed and supported by the Russians. The Americans gave support to West Berlin and ensured that Russian threats mounted three times against West Berlin failed. The Americans gave support to the United Nations forces in Korea when there was plain and open aggression by the North Koreans and the Chinese. Again we have the resolution of the United States which resulted in nuclear missiles being removed from Cuba. These attempts to probe the defences of the West were overcome because of the ultimate determination of the United States, which was known to the Russians, to use nuclear weapons if this should prove to be necessary. The threats have been overcome and as a result there is a less uneasy peace than there once was between the United States and Russia. But will Australia's determination fail now that the centre of the power struggle has shifted to South East Asia, to Vietnam, where it is no less important than were the previous threats in the world context but where it is infinitely more important to Australia? Events are now occurring in our part of the world where we must live till the end of time. If the events in South East Asia that are promoted by Peking and Hanoi, as I believe they are, are unchecked, in the medium term this will present a direct threat to the ultimate security of Australia. Believing this, any responsible Government must take steps to meet the threat. We have our alliances and our friends in the United States and the United Kingdom and in many Asian countries. But alliances and friendships are not enough. To be effective, they must be backed by action when action proves to be necessary. In June 1964, in a statement delivered by the Minister for Defence at that time, the Government announced considerable improvements in the conditions for volunteers in the Australian Regular Army and the Armed Forces generally. This resulted in a steady improvement in the re-engagement rate of regular soldiers. Our re-engagement rate stands at 70 per cent, of those eligible for re-engagement, and this is one of the highest rates of any army in the Western world. But the rate of re-engagement, with the number coming forward to volunteer, is not sufficient to supply the defence forces that Australia needs in the present situation. This circumstance is not peculiar to Australia. The number of people being drafted in the United States is running extremely high. It is interesting to note that more than half the total number of the United States troops in Korea came from the draft. A total of 1,500,000 men in Korea came from the United States draft. The number of United States draftees in South Vietnam is rising rapidly. If we cannot get enough volunteers for the Australian Regular Army, are we to say that we will not bother, that we will not take the pains to establish an Army of the size we need? If this were the view of the Government, as it appears to be the view of the Opposition, the Government would be guilty of gross irresponsibility. Any government that took that position should certainly be rejected by the people of Australia. What reason is there for saying, as the Australian Labour Party does, that we are prepared to make provision to defend Australia, but only with volunteers? What courage or bravery is there in saying that we will allow Australia to be defended only by volunteers; that we will hide behind the backs of volunteers; that we will not take the precautions and make the provisions that are necessary to secure the adequate defence of the country, but we will hide behind the backs of people with a very highly developed sense of patriotism and duty? That is the attitude of the Australian Labour Party. I do not think it is an attitude of which it can be proud. I believe that there is a national duty and a universal obligation for Australians to do what the security of Australia demands. In the ultimate, the Government, which is responsible for Australia's security, must make the judgment as to what the security of Australia demands. This is not a question of asking national servicemen to fight in some far field of France, as was the case between 1914 and 1918. It is not a question a taking part in some distant war which is no concern of ours. It is a question of taking part in a conflict which we believe is very directly concerned with our own ultimate security. This is quite a different situation from that which might have prevailed at some time in the past. If Australia and the Australian people cannot accept the responsibilities, the difficulties, the sacrifices and the burdens that are involved in the present situation, the Government at some future time may be faced with the much more difficult task of protecting our wives and children from inside Australia. Dr. 3. F. Cairns. - Mr. Speaker, I desire to make a personal explanation on the ground of misrepresentation. I have just had drawn to my attention a statement which is attributed to the honorable member for Chisholm (Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) at page 316 of 'Hansard' and in which, referring to me, he said - ","Ministerial Statement","GOVERNMENT POLICY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/para[3]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The details of such Bills are never the property of the Opposition until they have been presented to the House. The debate on Bills is rarely sufficiently delayed to allow an Opposition member to undertake proper research. The end result is that it is very difficult for the Opposition to be as well informed on pending legislation as is the Government. To my mind this creates a very serious fault in the operation of our democratic system. After all, an Opposition represents almost half of the people of Australia, and those people have every right to expect that their representatives will possess similar research facilities and assistance as do members of the Government. This fault needs to be rectified if our democratic way of life is to keep pace with the other ideologies enunciated in various parts of the world. We believe in criticism and freedom of speech. Constructive criticism ensures the proper working of our system but constructive criticism cannot be voiced unless the Opposition is well informed.  What then is the solution of our problem? First of all, we need to decide the functions of an Opposition. These are, I suggest, firstly, to offer an alternative government; secondly, to analyse and criticise government policy; thirdly, to prevent the increase of government by the executive, and fourthly, to safeguard the rights of the people and to be well informed, virile and active. With these points in mind I suggest the introduction of a research and reference bureau for the Opposition. This bureau would be under the direct control of the Leader of the Opposition but would remain an integral part of the Public Service. It would consist of an officer in charge and specialised staff seconded from various departments. Each officer would be responsible for analysing, appraising and evaluating the reports, statistics, statements and policies of three or four departments and a similar number of statutory bodies or commissions. The bureau would also be expected to undertake research and prepare submissions on ideas and suggestions of Opposition members. It would not take an active part in policy discussions of the Opposition and would have no direct access to confidential departmental files or information. However full co-operation should be extended by the departments. The introduction of an organisation of this nature would ensure that an Opposition would bc greatly assisted in performing the functions I enumerated earlier. It would reduce the Government's advantage in the field of research and information. It would increase the efficiency of the Opposition and greatly improve its potential as an alternative government. The power of the Executive would be curtailed as each Minister would be compelled to accept greater responsibility for decisions reached. The Executive would be reluctant to widen its power as it would be confronted with a critical analysis of all its regulations, activities and functions. An improvement in the research facilities available to the Opposition would mean a better informed and more active Opposition and would offer increased protection for the rights of the people. A criticism which may be levelled at the suggestion I have made is that Opposition members would have an advantage over the back bench members of the Government as these would still be expected to perform their own research. This need not be the case. The factual information available to the Ministers could and should be passed on to all Government supporters. As a matter of fact, the introduction of a research and reference bureau for the Opposition would make it imperative for Government supporters to be as well informed as the Ministers because the increased efficiency and knowledge of the Opposition would need to be matched by the Government side. It is natural that a government which is not opposed by a well informed and active Opposition soon becomes complacent, disinterested and arrogant, the standard of government declines, problems develop and the progress of the nation is drastically hindered. I am certain that the introduction of a research and reference bureau for the Opposition would increase the efficiency and standing of the Parliament, strengthen our democratic system and improve the standard of debate. The creation of a reference and research structure for the Opposition is even more imperative in this Parliament now than it has ever been before. The House of Representatives, in the Twenty-sixth Parliament, consists of 124 members with only one, the member for the Northern Territory, not having full voting rights. The Government side numbers eighty-two. made up of sixty-one representatives of the Liberal Party and twenty-one representatives of the Country Party. The Opposition consists of forty-two members of whom forty-one are representatives of the Labor Party. The remaining member is an Independent. The Government, therefore, has almost double the number of members in the Opposition. Yet the Opposition will be expected to match the Government with well informed speakers in all debates. This is almost an impossibility. The Government now has twenty-six Ministers, each with the facilities of a department at his disposal. Any Minister can, if he so desires, supply any back bench member of the Government with special information on a topic that is under discussion. Opposition members are left to their own resources. 'So what?' honourable members opposite may say: 'We won the election. Better facilities are among the plums of office. You will have the same advantages when you become a government.' My answer to this is that in the 1966 election for the House of Representatives, 5,892,327 votes were recorded. Of these, the Liberal Party received 2,291,964 and the Country Party received 561,926, making a total of 2.853,890 for the Government parties. The Labor Party received 2,282,834 votes, the residue of the votes either going to the Democratic Labor Party, the Independents and the Communists, or being informal. Of the total formal votes recorded, the Liberal Party received 40.14% and the Country Party 9.84%, making a total of 49.98% whilst the Labor Party, the official Opposition, -received 39.98%. This means that the Opposition polled only 571,056 votes fewer than the Government, or only 10% less than the total polled by the two Government parties. An examination of the Senate discloses that of the sixty senators, twenty-eight belong to the Government parties and twenty-eight to the official Opposition, the other four Senate positions being held by two members of the Democratic Labor Party and two Independents. So, for the small advantage of 571,056 votes, the Government gets all the facilities and the Opposition gets virtually none. This state of affairs is not in the interests of democracy or good parliamentary government, and it should be rectified. I ask the Prime Minister through the Minister for Works (Mr Kelly), who is sitting at the table, to examine carefully the proposition I have outlined today. The future of democracy and of parliamentary government, and the safeguarding of the four freedoms demand that the official Opposition of this Parliament, which represents 40% of the Australian voters, should have special reference and research facilities.

If my proposal were adopted - and I consider that it is the only reasonable approach to this matter - the members of the Senate would face the people only once for every two times that the members of the House of Representatives would face the electors. The main advantage of my suggestion would be the saving in cost. I think that this is one of the aspects of this problem we should examine. It is up to this House and it is up to members in another place to have a look at this matter. They should look at it from a national point of view. It is claimed that the other place is a House of review. Well, let senators review the cost that the Government is incurring in holding separate elections. This is one of the cases in which expenditure could be saved.  I could continue speaking for a long time as there is a great deal more that I would like to say. I want especially to say this: Despite the speech that I have made because of the limited time available to me, I make it clear that I refute again the challenges that I, personally, or my party is sectional in outlook. We are not sectional in outlook. But we do want to see balanced development of this country. I do not need to quote page after page, as some Labor Party members have done, the policy of the Australian Country Party. The policy of this Party supports the balanced development of Australia. We want to see industrial expansion. In Queensland, under a Country Party Premier, we have seen it. The efforts of Mr Nicklin in this direction were recognised by the companies concerned, which asked him to open many of their industrial projects. He has adequately represented all sections of the community in Queensland, with the possible exception of the disruptive Pat Mackie element which he did not support in any way but which, I noted, was supported by some members of the Australian , Labor Party and even by some members sitting on the other side of this House. With that qualification, 1 would say that in the Federal sphere and in the respective State spheres my Party is endeavouring to give fair representation to all sections of the community. I hope that this Government will be allowed to continue the great work that it has done for Australia over so many years. I am sure that it will.

The matter is based on pure assumption; it is completely void .of any fact, any happening or reference to any historical event. In every sense it represents a complete figment of the imagination and it is incredible that in these days when there are so many constructive issues on which an Opposition can be effective we should have honourable members .of such considerable status in the Opposition taking up the time of the Parliament on such a pathetic matter. I believe they ought to be disparaged and that the public will identify them as being petty in their approach to the parliamentary affairs of this country. What has happened this morning simply demonstrates the antipathy of leading members of the Opposition to the trade union movement of Australia. Because the Minister for Works (Senator Cavanagh) in another place has indicated that under his administration consideration will be given to those firms which have sensible relations with trade unions we find those leading Opposition members intent on demonstrating their spleen and their hostility. Every step taken and every utterance made by the Minister for Works has been designed to achieve the best results on behalf of the people of this country in relation to public works.

The old-fashioned washed-up attitudes and ideas of the previous Government were not achieving that result. This Government wants to make certain that we get performance from contractors, that we get good workmanship and that jobs are finished on time. It is saying in effect that strife ridden companies need not tender for public works in Australia. We want companies which have good relations with unions participating in public works. We do not want companies to be racing in and out of the Commonwealth Industrial Court or the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission getting determinations in such a way as will cause delays and bring about an aggravation of the cost factor in public works contracts. Of course, the sensible thing, and it is accepted by sensible people but apparently not by some leading members of the Opposition, these days is to effect decent relationships between employees and employers. The days of the master and butler have gone and the sooner it is realised by Opposition members that we will not have trade unionists pushed around any longer the better it will be for everyone concerned. In fact it would be contrary to the national interest for this Government to take the attitude that has been espoused here this morning by the Opposition.  Let me show in a pretty accurate way just how the attitude of the Opposition is out of date with contemporary attitudes. For example, is it realised that the International Labour Organisation convention No. 94 lays down a criterion which subscribing governments are expected to uphold and comply with to the effect that public contracts should have regard to union conditions? Apparently this has not been treated as important by the Opposition, the former Government for 23 years. The ILO convention makes it a requirement on the nations subscribing that proper regard should be had to industrial conditions of the kind which have been laid down by the Minister for Works in respect of the matter which is currently the subject of the debate. Is it realised that 31 countries uphold the idea that the Minister for Works has espoused? Is it realised that it is time the Australian Government followed belatedly, and that is the case, in the footsteps of these 31 countries which have been doing for many years what the Minister has been saying we should be doing? In the United Kingdom as far back as 1912 the House of Commons adopted a resolution upholding convention 94 and the United States of America emulated the United Kingdom example many years ago. Why is it that these matters have been overlooked in Australia? Of course there are winds of change blowing in respect of this and so many other significant areas of Government activity. This Government will stand firmly on the premise that it believes it is a good thing to set out to get value for money and to have co-operative employees and co-operate employers working together. The Minister for Works has never made the point that he will be heavy handed in respect of this matter. Let me repeat in precise terms what he has said. Maybe previous Opposition speakers have not had a good look at the situation but this is what the Minister said: ","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/para[2]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

He is aware, as we all are, that there is a shortage of goods and a shortage of labour. But he would reduce interest rates in order to increase demand. That is the classical economic theory on which the Leader of the Opposition worked when he was Treasurer, and I assume it is the theory he would accept now if he were the Treasurer. But the fact is that he is just talking. He has no sincerity whatsoever. How can any person respect a party which comes before the Parliament and proposes massive cuts in government revenue and massive increases in government expenditure?

As I said, the Opposition put forward as a matter of public importance She question of the removal of the superphosphate bounty. I read a comment in one of our newspapers - I think it was the 'Australian' - which said that there was a shortage of food in the world and that there was a danger in years ahead that the world would be very short of food. We know that problems in regard to food exist in many countries. I appreciate some of these problems and I accept the fact that in some cases, the problem is not so much one of a shortage of food itself as the lack of capacity to get food from where it is produced into certain areas. But it is suggested that there is a shortage of food. We have been talking about an energy crisis. I mentioned this in my own electorate the other day. The headlines of the newspapers have asked what is to be done in this circumstance or in that circumstance and saying that we should conserve our fuel and that we should do this and that we should do something else. It would be just as dangerous to the world to have a shortage of food as it would be to have a shortage of energy. Yet the people in the primary producing areas who contribute to the strength of the economy of this country are making this contribution with very little assistance from governments. This Government, instead of assisting the primary producers, is doing everything that it can to make conditions difficult and to reduce production. That was the great argument that members of my Party and Opposition members put forward during the debate on the superphosphate bounty. We should endeavour to do everything that we can to increase production and to help primary producers.  As I have said, I have read reports on numerous occasions where people talk about the inefficiency of the farmer and say that by giving them subsidies and assistance we were only backing them up in their inefficiencies. Surely anybody who has any understanding of primary production realises the problems that are faced by the man on the land. As I said, we have seen such problems only in recent weeks. It was pointed out in the House that in certain areas where there had been a great deal of rain, now the farmers were finding it difficult to plough the ground because the ground was so hard. These are the problems faced by the farmer. The farmer sows his crop and waits for the harvest. He gets floods. He gets rain when it is not required and he gets droughts when he wants rain. He has absolutely no control over these things. ","Address-in-Reply","SPEECH OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/para[7]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I notice that Opposition members have no argument with that.

We are told that honourable members opposite are frightened that the Labor Party has embarked on a course which will enable it to hold government for all time.

For years we heard the members of the Country Party speak about what should be done for rural people and what should be done for rural industries, but nothing was done. That is why they are where they are today. Nothing was done for rural people and nothing was done for rural industries. Today something has been done. The first criterion by which one can judge this is the income of rural people. It is immeasurably higher today than it was under the previous Government, and the people of Australia recognise this. The people of Australia will back us up all the way. Who but the present Opposition would oppose the Bills by which we propose to change the Constitution or attempt to deny to the people of Australia the benefits and democratic rights to which they are entitled. I do not think one would find another Opposition in Australia which would be prepared to oppose not only the legislation which would allow these referendums to be put to the people but also the right of the people of Australia to decide for themselves. Honourable members opposite are the judges and the jury. They sit in this House, dissociated from their constituents, with no idea of the wishes, aspirations or hopes of those constitutents, and they pass judgment. But they are not passing judgment on the Government; they are passing judgment on themselves.

Thank heavens it is not. The fact of the matter is that in addition to the measures that I have mentioned the present Government has also successfully and effectively established the Prices Justification Tribunal which everybody acknowledges and concedes has some regulatory and slowing down effect in the natural trend to inflation. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Prices, which is made up of people from both sides of the Parliament, has also been established. Is the Opposition prepared to disparage that committee?

This is what this Government has set out to do in a blatantly arrogant and harsh manner irrespective of the effects it has on disadvantaged people. The contradiction, of course, between the mythology of what the Speech sets out to do and the reality of what the Government is actually doing has been spelt out very forcibly and very well by many excellent speeches of Opposition members. I might add, that it has been spelt out too by some outspoken criticism by some of the more senior members of the Government back bench who find the hypocrisy of the Speech rather too much even for their well-conditioned hides. It is quite obvious from the Speech and from the actions of the Government that when it refers to 'regulating business activity to prevent exploitation of consumers' what it really means is reviewing the Trade Practices Act to ease the regulation of business. Goodness knows, it was timid enough even with a Labor Government.  In Canberra, for instance, Government action means depriving the private sector of long service leave payments and abolition of the Government Conveyancing Office, handing conveyancing back to the legal profession where the cost will no doubt double. It also means reverting to land auction and adjusting the reserve prices of allocated lands to prices obtained at auction. It means putting pressure on the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly to lift rent and price controls in Canberra. It is amazing what a devastating collection of measures these are to protect and avoid exploitation of the consumer. Another strong plank in the Governor-General's Speech is more effective assistance to the disadvantaged, but government action has singled out disadvantaged people for special consideration. These are the special considerations they have been given: A 50c increase in prescription charges; the delaying of a legitimate pension increase; and for pensioners who do not survive without the increase the abolition of pensioner funeral benefits; a reduction in welfare services through the imposition of staff ceilings; and a heavy reduction of overseas aid programs to deprived countries. By these generous measures our Government extends special consideration to the disadvantaged not only in this community but also in other countries! A phrase such as 'giving effective educational opportunities to the disadvantaged and handicapped' sounds wonderful. In Canberra it means: Depriving the Koo marr i workshop of Government printing jobs; scrapping the work experience program for intellectually handicapped people; cutting down on remedial teaching and other special classes as well as reducing ancillary staff in our schools. All this has happened not only in Canberra but also all over Australia in every State. The Governor-General's Speech refers briefly to self-government in the Australian Capital Territory. Here again, the Government's statement is quite ambiguous. It refers to giving the Legislative Assembly responsibility for financial management and decision-making in Canberra's local affairs. A notable omission of course is that no reference is made to giving the Legislative Assembly legislative powers. What nonsense is this? We call it a Legislative Assembly but we will not give it legislative powers. The fear amongst local advocates of self-government on both sides of the political spectrum is that the Assembly will end up as something even less than a municipal-type council. This is not the intention of the advocates of self-government. It is not the intention of the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory last year. I hope it is not the intention of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley). The Government has set up a task force to report on the matter. If the task force does not recommend giving the Assembly legislative powers the Minister and the Government if necessary should make sure that they are given because it would be quite facial to call it a Legislative Assembly and not give it legislative powers. The ultimate in double-talk in the Governor-General's Speech is the expressed wish to expand job opportunities. This should be interpreted as meaning staff ceilings in the Australian Public Service, which I am afraid will require retrenchments if they are to be achieved or, alternatively, hundreds of people going on unattached lists with no prospect of getting another job and ultimate retrenchment. It also means the breaking down of valuable professional institutions such as the National Capital Development Commission as well as a severe cut in that organisation's works budget, thus inducing serious unemployment in the building trades. The NCDC has taken a long time to build up and its morale has been completely shattered by recent proposed retrenchments. The investment allowance is a typical measure in line with this Government's overall policy but the amendments just announced could not in any way be seen as a measure to reduce the Budget deficit. I know it is said that a Budget deficit will not be avoided this year, but the investment allowance will not improve the chances of avoiding a deficit next year. It will make administration more complicated and expensive. It still does not help small businessmen investing in equipment costing $500 or less. Overriding the significance of the investment allowance are the serious consequences of the Government's cuts in consumer spending and the effect that this policy will have on overall demand. Businessmen will not invest merely to please this Government if the Government does not play its part in stimulating demand. The Government's measures affect demand not only by increasing unemployment but also by increasing indirect taxes and reducing overtime, thus reducing the spending power of those still in employment.

I can honestly say that I have not heard one new word uttered from the Opposition benches since Parliament resumed. We heard it all during the 1975 election campaign. Opposition members have now introduced the 1975 campaign into the Thirtieth Parliament. They continue to expand their views on democracy. I wonder whether they would like Australia to have the sort of democracy which operates in Iraq. Members of the Opposition can rest assured that we on this side of the House trust the written Constitution and have explicit faith in the Governor-General. They may also rest assured that the people of Australia will not forget their deeds of 17 February.  Another point that disturbs me is that the pensioners of Australia are paid on a flat rate Australia-wide. No allowance whatsoever is made for the different areas in which they reside. The pensioners of the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia receive exactly the same amount of money and the same privileges as the pensioners who reside in Sydney and Melbourne.

I believe that those tables set out the situation quite clearly. Anyone who complains about the loading, as Opposition members would call it, towards the country electorates will see the situation clearly set out in the table on page 319.I will not deal with those tables in detail because the figures provided are quite numerous. A study of the figures reveals that very few electorates have a population which is more than 10 per cent above or below the quota. I think that answers the criticisms that have been made.  It has been suggested that some consideration should have been given to the 7 large electorates. I go along with that proposition because there are problems in the areas involved. Those problems are not confined to one particular political party because, as it so happens, all three parties are represented in those 7 electorates. They include the electorates of Kalgoorlie, Grey, Maranoa, Darling, Leichhardt and Kennedy. I believe that some consideration should have been given to those areas, because if the migrant population creates a heavy work load to people representing the metropolitan areas, we should think of the work load imposed, for example, on my colleagues, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett), in trying to visit their constituents. As I have said on a previous occasion, very few constituents in those areas can contact their Federal member at a local telephone call charge; they all have to pay the trunk call fee. If they wanted to visit their Federal member for any reason, heaven only knows what would be the average distance they would have to travel. In many cases it would be hundreds of miles instead of the few hundred yards which people in the metropolitan areas have to travel. In the short time available to me I want to make a very brief comment about my own electorate because all of the speculators have forecast that my electorate is about to disappear. If that does occur, I suppose I will be very disappointed, but what is far more important than that is the fact that the Wimmera electorate has been in existence since Federation. 'Wimmera' is not only the name of a Federal electorate, it is also a well known geographical name and no doubt the people who live in that constituency will be very disappointed, not at seeing my face disappear from the scene but rather at seeing the disappearance of the electorate in which they have been so proud to be resident for many years.

Some people would argue that our system is not representative because it does not embody for this House proportional or other forms of representation. All I can say to that is that our system is democratic and, in this Jubilee year, might I say that I hope it will endure as a system of consititutional monarchy for a long time. But it will survive only if we maintain and enhance its democratic values at a time when democratic values and the things which accompany them such as human rights and civil liberties are disappearing extremely quickly around the globe. From memory, only about 25 of the 140-odd individual independent nations of the world are exceptionally democratic with independent parliaments and with judiciaries. There are 115 or so regimes which need a strong democratic example such as we have in Australia. This Bill helps to give to this country a strong democratic representation in this place. Essentially, our system is a blend of the single constituency preferential 2-party system in the House of Representatives and of proportional representation in the Senate. That gives the people of this country the opportunity to have two bites at the cherry, or rather to enjoy the whole cherry.  The other aspect which is subject to controversy is the question of preferential voting, which thankfully is still embodied in the main Act. My attitude to it is that such a scheme maximises opportunities in the selection of candidates. The simplest way of explaining it is to say that under preferential voting, where the choice is wide, the scaling of priorities among candidates by citizens is a most natural selection, like everything else we do. For the benefit of Opposition members, I point out that in the morning we get up and choose our clothes. Some members might have the opportunity to go to their stores to pick out some bright clothes in which to come to this House. But we have a choice. It has been said about this legislation that there is going to be a 7 year lapse between redistributions. Surely the legislation itself ensures that there will be a review each year based upon population.

The opposition which haS just been put forward to clause 10 is simply humbug because, as was explained in the second reading speech on this Bill, the 7 year minimum requirement for a redistribution is justified when we look at the historical record in this country of when redistributions have taken place. We are told that 7 years is too long a span of time, but when we examine the record we see that, with the exception of the occasional State redistribution, one national redistribution was carried out in 1 906, one in 1 9 1 3, one in 1 922, one in 1934, one in 1949, one in 1955, one in 1968, and we are about to carry out one this year. That means that we have had only 8 redistributions in the 76 years since Federation. On average that means that we have had one distribution every 9Â½ years.

Quite frankly, as other Opposition members have said, this Bill is a sham. It is a supreme irony that it comes before the House after a week of condemning the Soviet Union for the lack of human rights in that country. Of course, supreme ironies are not uncommon with this Government. I was amazed the other night to hear the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) talking about his concern for the Afghans being killed.

It has used the motion as an opportunity to run a few hares, out of which it thinks it can get some political mileage. It has shown that since it went into opposition last, it has not changed one little bit. It has no consideration for the national interest and no consideration for putting facts before the Parliament. It is back at its old trick of accusing an incoming government of doing what it planned to do itself. The facts stay; they are there . The former Prime Minister indicated that his Government had no intention of acquiring fixed wing capacities for the Navy. The problem is that Opposition members did not have the guts to tell people when there was an election coming. The facts are that the former Government had no intention of acquiring a carrier for the Navy and Cabinet submissions were before the Government on that matter. It did not tell anyone about that matter because it did not want to tell anyone about that matter.  One of the other matters which concerns me is the degree to which people have been misled by statements by the former Government. It was, unfortunately, a practice to tell people that things would be done or had been done when they had not been done, and not the least of those matters was in respect of funds which would be made available. The former Government has run down the defence forces of Australia. It has-if the former Minister considers it such-neglected its responsibilities to national security, in that the former Minister says that the disclosures which have now become apparent constitute a danger to Australia in respect of the Australian Intelligence Security Organisation and other security organisations. The former Government had those reports in its possession for the last seven years and did nothing at all about them.

As the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) , the Treasurer, so cogently put it this week, it is a pity that Opposition members have not been crying those crocodile tears for the unemployed over the past seven years. In February 1976, 5.4 per cent of the work force was unemployed. By February 1983 the figure had grown to 10.7 per cent. The National Economic Summit Conference was the first attempt by a government to come to grips with the communication problem between governments and the people for whom they are legislating. As such, it should be applauded not only by the business and consumer community but also by the Opposition, which after all is part of the Parliament which has been elected to represent the people. As the representatives of the housing industry pointed out, the recently convened meeting of the industry attended by the Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr Hurford), the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) was another example of reporting to the people affected by legislation before that legislation is enacted.  The labour intensive construction of houses forms an integral part of the reconstruction of human lives which we are undertaking in Australia. While we in the Australian Labor Party have certainly worn the tag of the compassionate and sometimes do-gooders who wear our hearts on our sleeves, it is a fact, not widely recognised but nonetheless true, that we who have come to office from the ranks of the less privileged have a strong streak of practicality born of experience. This practicality is reflected in policies and attitudes towards social problems. Nowhere is this more apparent than in policies to combat unemployment. In vivid contrast to the non-policies of the Liberal and National parties, which parties point-blank refused to consider job creation schemes in the face of unemployment of dimensions unknown since the Depression of the 1930s, Labor thinking suggests that while long term policies dealing with the impact of a new technology are essential it is not only compassionate but also good sense to ensure that in the short term jobs are created. In similar practical fashion, we as a government will base our job creation on construction projects which will also go a long way towards alleviating the accommodation problem of thousands of unlucky Australians, given that we will have to phase in the programs which we wish to pursue, owing to the size of the deficit which we inherited. We will meet this priority and this will not only meet the prime objective of any healthy society, and that is that every last person in the society should have a decent standard of living, but will also give added spending power and stimulate, and inject hope into, a depressed business and consumer community. Our Government has opened the lines of communication with that community. It is the only reasonable way to run a country. The only surprising aspect is that such meetings and communication between governments and business and community groups have not taken place before. It does not surprise me that a green-eyed Opposition Leader subjects us to a tantrum on the success of the Government's operation in public relations, but it saddens me and I ask, in the name of the people who elected both the Government and the Opposition to represent them, that he exercise a little restraint. I now look forward to a further outreach into the community by a government committed to meeting the needs of that community. The previous Government's reaction was to suppress publication of figures on unemployment. I hark back to the actions of the previous Government, because it is so important to the success of our policies that the community realise just what has been done in the name of party politics by the Opposition. As the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) pointed out yesterday, one of his first steps upon reaching office was to order a collection of the figures on the unemployed on a regional basis. The collection on 17 March showed a total of 822,000 Australians officially without a job. The Government will reinstate the collection and publication of these figures. We do so in the belief that before a problem can be rectified it must first be recognised. This is a major reason for the failure of the previous Government to come to grips with the burgeoning economic and therefore social problems in Australia. It typifies the vast gap separating the Liberal-National Party and Labor policy. It is the reason why Australians turned to the Labor Party and it is the reason why Australia now, under new leadership, is turning its face in a new direction, away from the frightening sterile landscape of recession to the hope of revival born of long-sighted planning and compassionate administration. I turn now to one facet of the appropriations now under discussion which is a statistical reflection of the human face of poverty which is now, regrettably, a part of Australia. A sum of $2m is sought to supplement grants administered by the Department of Social Security for community welfare agencies. This supplementation is necessary because of the great burden on welfare agencies due to an unprecedented influx in the number of people seeking relief from poverty. Who are these people who are forced to go to charity for the first time in their lives in order to feed their families? They are the three million people who, according to the Australian Council of Social Service figures, are now living below the poverty line. In 1978 a joint government study with ACOSS regarding emergency relief proved that up to 90 per cent of those people on relief were social security beneficiaries. Many of those people are on the unemployment benefit. But let us not get emotional about the situation. We will talk of facts and figures. Over the past 12 months, welfare agencies such as Life Line, the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Salvation Army have been unable to meet the requirements of thousands of people who have never gone to charity before but who are now going not just for clothing and shelter, but for food, for the very necessities of life. A typical picture is a family whose income earner has been retrenched. Whether he is paying rent, which could be $50 to $100 per week in Brisbane, or whether he is meeting large payments on his house, housing takes such a lump out of the amount he gets in unemployment benefit that it is not surprising that he cannot make ends meet. This is a reality. In Brisbane alone over 200,000 people live below the poverty line. The way in which this has affected welfare agencies has become obvious. Twelve months ago Life Line was distributing food parcels worth $65 for emergency cases . Because of the number of people who are now coming for relief, it has had to cut the value of those parcels back to $25. It gives out food parcels worth $10, $15 and $25 at a time when the dollar does not go as far. St Vincent de Paul in Brisbane alone is expending $2,000 a day on food. These people do not come for the secondary necessities of clothing and shelter but for the urgent requirement of food. A profile of people in Brisbane and across Australia who now do not have enough money to buy food for their families is instanced in an article from the Brisbane Telegraph of last night. The article, headed 'Baked beans on the dole' states: Putting the car up for sale because you cannot afford to register it, coming home to share baked beans on toast with your pregnant wife and three children- this is the life of the unemployed family man in Brisbane. Ian last enjoyed a full-time job 10 months ago. He is a professional fisherman, jack-of-all-trades, and had 'people knocking on the door' with offers of work. His wife, Sandra, who is expecting their fourth child in October, said: 'You really take that pay-packet for granted, when it comes in regularly.' They will never take it for granted again. . . . Their fortnightly $297.60 dole cheque is usually accounted for before it arrives. Sometimes, bills account for two cheques at a time. It was this which brought Ian and Sandra and their children, aged 6 years, 3, and seven months, to Life Line. For the first time, they had to ask for outside help. 'We're able to get clothes from second-hand shops, but even their prices are going up. So is milk and electricity,' said Sandra. 'It was Ian's birthday last week and there wasn't enough petrol in the car to take it for a drive. It was a quiet birthday.' That picture is not something out of a Victorian novel. That is what is happening in Australia today. It is all very well to have an influx of facts and figures-and they are necessary-but until this House comes to grips with the problem that gives rise to the facts and figures it will be impossible to get Australia back on the road to recovery. That is the difference between the last Government and this one. Before a problem can be cured it must be recognised and its dimensions must be recognised. We sat here for seven years and saw those dimensions go unrecognised. It was very bad to hear then Government members say that there were no huge unemployment figures. They did not recognise the fact of unemployment, and that is on record.

The honourable member for Hunter has referred already to the vast volumes of the Act. I have heard him speak in this House on many occasions with the freedom of Opposition membership. He was able to make rash statements and promises which do not have to be met now that he has been transferred to the Government benches. I intend to refer to that aspect later. Perhaps some of those inequities about which we spoke when we were in Government will be redressed in the term of his Government. Income equalisation deposits and the averaging system that is available to primary producers might be further extended to those service industries which deal predominantly with primary industries that are subject to the fluctuations in prices, the droughts, the floods and the bad times, as are their clients, the primary producers. Those are just one or two examples.  I am glad that the honourable member for Hunter has spoken on this Bill. Going back through the records, I find it would appear that the reason he mentioned the full front bench on this side of the House was that he now sits on the back benches on the other side. He was responsible predominately when in Opposition for taxation matters; he spoke on taxation matters when the present Government was in Opposition. I pay him credit for the fact that he was born in a good year and in a good month. He is slightly older than I am, but there the comparison ends. On the other hand, the Minister for Finance, when he was in Opposition, had very little to say about taxation matters. Perhaps it is only because of the strict adherence by the honourable member for Hunter to a political philosophy or because he followed too closely in the steps of the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, that he has been relegated to the back bench and is not a member of the front bench. I am very sorry about that. I would have thought that , not so much because of his knowledge but as a result of the great number of words of wisdom that he spoke from the benches of the Opposition he should have been relegated to the front bench. Then again that is another matter. In that respect I refer to the great liberties that an Opposition can take from its position. I use as an illustration an extract from a speech made by the honourable member for Hunter on 27 October 1982 concerning the terrible things that were happening under our Government as far as tax evasion and tax avoidance were concerned. I think the honourable member would give us credit for the previous Treasurer putting tax avoidance measures, at some considerable extension of the Income Tax Assessment Act, into their proper perspective and closing them off as quickly as attention was alerted to them. The honourable member is reported on page 2627 of Hansard of 27 October as saying: The position in Australia at present is that through tax evasion and avoidance the Treasury, the Commonwealth Government, and all of the taxpayers in Australia who meet their responsibilities are being ripped off-- They would be the honourable member's words, would they not- to the extent of probably $7,000m every year. Of course these figures cannot be refuted. They have been supplied by much more eminent authorities than I would ever claim to be.

The turnaround and the continual somersaults of members of the Opposition are quite incredible. Here they are trying to hold the Government to ransom and to hold up the passage through the Parliament of the Bill to make the ABC a corporation, all because, as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, the ABC must retain its independence. Yet we know, as the Minister pointed out last week, the number of times the previous Government attempted to interfere with the ABC verbally, when the former senior Cabinet Minister, Mr Peter Nixon, on several occasions attempted to interfere with the ABC. If the ABC is not in as good a state as it should be, let us remember that Opposition members were in government for 31 of the last 34 years.

Let us look at the last appropriation of the Labor Government under Mr Whitlam in 1975. The appropriation then was $132.1m. After three years of the Fraser Government, in 1978, the appropriation was $141.5m. That is a rise of a little over 7 per cent. In fact, at that stage inflation would have been in excess of 33 per cent. So there was a real reduction of 26 per cent or 27 per cent in just three years of appropriations for the ABC under the Fraser Government. That Government did not interfere with the ABC-oh no; it just tried to strangle the ABC to death. Yet Opposition members have the audacity to come before the House tonight and support an amendment which the honourable member for Murray has moved, which will not be successful in trying to stifle the ABC once more. It is not on. This Government has a resolve to bring this legislation into operation and, thus, the new Corporation. It will be an independent corporation. It will not be interfered with by the present Government, nor, I hope, by successive governments, no matter what their political persuasion. It is a disgrace that we have this sort of amendment before us tonight. It really is getting down to the depths.  Rational debate from the Opposition is rather hard to get these days. The honourable member for Murray alluded to the nominations to the board. That is a separate issue. There will be fewer board members than there are members of the Commission, so someone will have to miss out. There will obviously be a reorganisation of that. But we have bowed to the greater wisdom on this occasion of the former member for Diamond Valley who included the nominations provision that exists in this legislation. We opposed it at that time, but we felt that that part of the Bill to set up this Corporation was best the way that it was. However, I remind the House of what I said earlier: The broadcasting industry, more than any other industry, is an ever-evolving industry which will need to be monitored. There may well be changes in a number of areas as the ABC settles down to finding out what is really working smoothly and whether there are any hiccups. Then it would come back to the Government and say: 'Surely we can refine this area or that area for the betterment of the ABC and the broadcasting industry so that we can have a strong broadcasting industry with government and private enterprise working together'. Until we have that, and not self- interested parties trying to push their own barrow, we shall not have the sort of industry and the quality of program that I am sure we would all like. Once again, I congratulate the Minister. The amendment is a disgrace to the Parliament, and I am sure that it will be defeated. I strongly support the legislation.

Slander and innuendo have replaced reasoned debate and concern for the truth. But the voters in New South Wales will not be impressed. Do honourable members opposite think for one moment that the voters in Manly, Earlwood, Gundagai, Queanbeyan-in any part of New South Wales-will really change their votes because of the scandalous accusations of the Opposition? They will vote on the jobs generated through the public works program, and on the stable government that Neville Wran has provided for New South Wales for the past seven years.  The real loser in the debate, besides the obvious victims of the character assassinations which have occurred, is the Parliament itself. This debate has demonstrated that many politicians do not deserve the privileges they hold in this House. Politicians must earn the respect of their communities.

The difference between the Government and the Opposition on this matter relates purely and simply to the question of the commencement date. We see no reason for this Bill to have a retrospective operation. We have not been given any really valid reasons by the Government in the course of the debate for its proposed commencement date. We have produced a very compelling reason for it to run from 12 May 1982. It was on that date that I warned all and sundry that the then Government and, by implication, a subsequent government if it was of like mind on these matters would act legislatively. I recall that particular occasion. The announcement that I made received very wide publicity, so there can be no argument or cavil from those concerned with these matters whether that is a legitimate date. In the course of this debate, no arguments have been advanced, no evidence has been adduced, and no reasons have been given other than the normal, quite misleading fulminations of the Labor Party against the Opposition-these weird and wonderful claims about Opposition members being the friends of all these dreadful people who lurk around the corner and prey upon the weak and indefensible in our community. We have become very conditioned to that attack.  I appreciated very much the reasoned contribution that was made to the debate by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). The honourable member for Charlton is always reasoned and interesting, but the honourable member for Stirling made a very valuable contribution to the debate, one that I appreciated very much. But I have to tell him that during the recent election campaign I found that this question of the Opposition's attitude towards the tax avoidance legislation that has been blocked in the Senate was not quite the winner for the Government that it thought. In fact, the public is getting pretty bored with the argument. By and large, the public has been convinced by a variety of sources, some within the Government, that, whilst it may have been easy to persuade people six or seven years ago that tax avoidance was a problem in our community, there is now a growing belief that the esoteric, artificial schemes have been effectively brought to an end. When people such as the former Minister for Finance, the present Minister for Trade (Mr Dawkins), the present and former Commissioners of Taxation and leading members of the legal and accounting professions run around saying so, it becomes obvious that the arguments being advanced by the Government amount to so much beating of the drum and are starting to wear a little thin. On behalf of the Opposition I say that if the Government imagines that it is onto some kind of electoral winner with this issue, it is wrong. I say to those members of the Australian Democrats who have voted with us on this issue previously that they ought not to be concerned about that part of their policy; they ought to be worried about their disastrous anti-American nuclear policies, which will do far more damage to the well-being of this country than the other attitudes they are adopting. I cannot condemn their attitudes on those matters strongly enough. Their attitudes on those issues are even worse than those of the left wing of the Australian Labor Party. However, I recognise that that really does not have anything to do with this amendment. Let me say, in conclusion, that the Opposition will give full and proper support to any legitimate anti-tax avoidance measures introduced by the Hawke Government. In that vein we give our support fully for the prospective operation of this legislation from the time that a warning was given. However, in accordance with the stance we have adopted as an opposition we see no reason at all, no evidence produced, no justification, no argument and absolutely no warrant at all for this legislation to operate from 1 July 1980. We reject that proposition. We will move an amendment in this Committee debate. If that amendment is not accepted by the Government the Opposition will vote against the third reading of this Bill.

The Opposition voted against that legislation. Opposition members did not have the numbers here to defeat it but with their allies in the Senate they got the numbers, so we did not pick up that $570m. We amended the legislation. We brought it back in again in order to seek to pick up $270m. They voted against it again and they got their allies in the Senate to vote against it and to defeat it. Finally, we amended the legislation again-in fact, we emasculated it. All we intended to do then was to tighten up the Opposition's legislation and pick up about $35m when it should have been $840m. What happened? Opposition members voted against it again in this chamber, and in conjunction and alliance with their allies in the Senate they defeated that legislation again. That was an amount in real terms of $840m that should have gone into the Commonwealth coffers to reduce the burden of taxation on the genuine pay as you earn taxpayer and the genuine business taxpayers who have been denied and repudiated by this Opposition, which has identified itself as a conservative Opposition, intent on applying its energies, whatever talents may be available to it, its time and sweat on defending the shysters-all the rip-off merchants. That is what is occurring. Why do not members of the Opposition re-examine their position and their credibility? Why do they not re-examine their reputation and their status before the Australian people? What happened to that once proud Liberal Party and to that once proud National Party? What a coalition of shyster defenders and protectors we have in this place at the present time!  We have indicated that we will persist with our attempt to have this legislation operate from 1 July 1980. We will have it applying from that date because that is the significant date from which those types of schemes, which have not yet been covered by legislation but will be covered by this legislation, started to operate. Would you believe, Madam Chair, how much Opposition members want us to pick up as a result of their amendment? It would be $500,000. For those shysters that the Opposition has been protecting, that is pocket money, pin money. That is the amount which the shysters that the Opposition protects and defends give to their wives to do the midweek shopping. The former Commissioner of Taxation's report in December 1983 indicated that about 5,000 of these trust stripping operations have been undertaken at a total loss to revenue of between $350m and $400m. We have a clear, positive, definite and repeated mandate from the Australian people to pursue the shysters, and pursue those shysters we will. If the Opposition persists, as it is now doing, in its efforts to defend and protect them, it should get out around the hustings and the traps and defend its position. It will not do so because it will not be game to do it, because in their vengeance the honest taxpayers, the pay as you earn taxpayers and the honest businessmen taxpayers, will have their revenge on the Opposition as they have on the two previous occasions. I appeal to the Australian Democrats in the Senate. We need their support to pick up this money. They should support us if they wish to restore any semblance of the credibility which they once had in this nation. They said they would 'keep the bastards honest', as honourable members might recall. That was their slogan. It is not an expression which I choose to use, but I know it is a very common expression in Australia. Let us identify them.

If the leaders of this great nation desire to change attitudes and values they should do so by convincing a majority of people before legislating and not after. Let me illustrate by using two examples of recent times how this present Government ignored this fundamental principle of a free democracy, legislated first and then tried to convince the people second. First, in an area of Tasmania which was formerly part of my electorate it used all the force of the law to override the express wishes of Tasmanians by preventing a hydro-dam being built. This was seen to be all the more unprincipled when, during the last election, it was not prepared to act in the same manner over Daintree Rainforest. Where is such a government's integrity? Secondly, there has been the opening of the floodgates to pornography and violent videos. I have listened to some of the new Opposition members talking about family matters, and I just trust that members on the Government side will do everything they can to look after families and not do what this Government did in its last term. The subsequent outcry clearly illustrates the people were not convinced by, are not convinced by, and indeed are strongly opposed to, such a change in permitted standards. It was left to the States, not the Government, to express the wishes of the people. That is a tragedy.  In conclusion, Mr Speaker, let us remember that the only authority governments have is dependent on the mutual co-operation of the people, that the only power that governments have is given by the consent of the people, that the only money governments have is provided by the people, and that each time this House passes new legislation it affects the lives of men, women and children.

Whoever Opposition members claim to speak for, they cannot claim to speak for the United States. Their whining has been refuted as flimsy and as pathetic. By whom? By the declarations from the United States by the Chief Executive of the United States Administration, President Reagan. Let me remind the House of what President Reagan had to say at the White House on 7 February this year, at the time of the departure of the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Hawke):  Australia is a reliable ally, an important trading partner, a trusted friend and a fellow democracy. He said of Australia and the United States: We've stood together through trials and tribulations. We've rejoiced together in triumph . . . As a key ally and a vital voice in world affairs, Australia makes a significant contribution to the way we approach international challenges. I repeat the words 'as a key ally'. What does this mishmash, this contrived posturing of the Opposition, declare? It declares that we have failed to act as a responsible partner in the Western alliance. The President of the United States has declared that we are a faithful ally and a vital voice in world affairs and that we make a significant contribution to the way the United States approaches international affairs. This concocted nonsense has been cobbled together in desperation by this very desperate Opposition. On ANZUS we are told, en passant, that it is in tatters; it no longer stands. This is what the American Secretary of State for East Asia, Mr Wolfowitz, had to say at a Press conference in Washington on 7 February: I think ANZUS is a treaty we view as intact. We would like to keep it intact. It's certainly very strong and solid with the Australians. I have no more to say of a very lengthy series of declarations of firm commitment by the United States to its relationship with Australia-a commitment declared positively and unambiguously by the United States Administration. In the light of all of that and in the light of this repudiation of the Opposition's cheap, contrived misrepresentation, one must ask oneself some questions about the motivation of the Opposition. Is the Opposition trying to undermine the confidence of this community or undermine the conviction of the United States about Australia at a very delicate time, at a very difficult time? We acknowledge that it is a time of difficulty and we have conveyed our concerns to the United States and New Zealand about the present situation in respect of ANZUS. Just because we are not shouting abuse from the rooftops and hurling invective across the aisle at one or other party to the Treaty, a member of the alliance, the Opposition feels that insufficient is being done. The proper and effective way to approach this sort of problem is to have continuous exchange between all three parties. There is no doubt about our concern in respect of ANZUS and the present situation; there is no doubt about our commitment and the undilutable quality of that commitment. Both on public record and in private discourse we have made that clear. We would hope that somewhere along the line, somehow, we will be successful in persuading the Government of New Zealand to change its tack, to adopt the sorts of courses we have adopted and persist with or, as the United States says, to rejoin active participation in the Treaty and its obligations. Members of the Opposition simply believe that if they hee and haw long enough their jackass antics will be taken seriously. It will not be long before we get blamed for the turmoil in Burkinosaso or the breakdown in Chad, or perhaps soon we will get retrospectively the blame for the football war in Central America. This is a futile and pathetic effort by the Opposition to try to poison the mind of the Australian public, to try to sow seeds of doubt that the Labor Government is anti-alliance, anti-Western and anti-American. The Americans have made it clear that the Labor Government is none of those things-that it is trusted, it is supported, it is endorsed and, more than that, it is influential within the associations it has with the United States and other countries. There has been, understandably, a great deal of focus on ANZUS. We have said on many occasions that it is a keystone to our defence and international political arrangements. But, by definition, using the English language parsed properly, 'keystone' means that it is one and that there are other keystones. Why is not some attention being given to those other keystones of our relationships? The world is much bigger than just the immediate area in question. It is extremely important but it is not the beginning and end or the totality of all of our concerns. For instance, we have key interests with the Association of South East Asian Nations. That is not covered by ANZUS. Is it suggested that that is a matter of indifference, of inconsequence? Nor is Papua New Guinea covered by ANZUS, but it is extremely important, as is the five power agreement. So too are commerce and diplomacy critical on the wider canvas for a country such as Australia. Then, of course, there is Australia's engagement under the defence co-operation program. That has been sustained by a succession of governments in this country. Political colour, conservative or Labor, is a matter of indifference; it has been supported. It was supported by the Whitlam Labor Government and by the Fraser Government, and it is being supported by the Hawke Government. This year we will be spending nearly $50m on defence co-operation in our region. About $18m of that will go to Papua New Guinea. The ASEAN countries will receive nearly $24m. Most of the remainder is to be distributed in the south west Pacific. As I say, it is focussed on our neighbouring South East Asian and South Pacific regions. The broad objective of the defence co-operation program is to promote the national independence of the participating countries. We participate on a regular basis in a large number of combined military exercises on either a bilateral basis or a multilateral basis. We carry out those exercises with other allies. We conduct with the United States land, air and maritime exercises which aim at improving inter-operability with our ally-air defences, air-submarine warfare, control of shipping, general training, et cetera. Under the five-power defence arrangements we exercise with the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore and New Zealand. We exercise also with regional countries, such as Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, and with old Commonwealth countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. From that outline we can see that the relationship within the alliance is not only as the Americans describe in respect of ANZUS-a very strong, enduring and viable thing insofar as the association between Australia and the United States is concerned. It is much more comprehensive than that. We do make a substantial and enduring contribution to what might be more generally described as the Western alliance. On critical tests this Government has stood up and been successful on the issues that really count. Let me take the issue of United States facilities in Australia, a subject of considerable disputation in this community. The Prime Minister and I stood up publicly, in the democratic forum-something foreign to members of the conservative parties-at the National Conference of the Australian Labor Party, and in any other forum available to us in this country for months on end, as we still do, to argue the justification for those facilities. We proposed and promoted them and we declared their essential linkage in policies such as those concerning deterrence and verification. I have said before that we wish it was a happier world to live in with no nuclear weapons or the threat of them and with arms control effectively in place. We aim at that very praiseworthy objective. We do not pretend to have a monopoly on this sort of thing but we would like a little credit for work we have done. In the meantime, living in an imperfect world, we have responsibilities in respect of those facilities. That is why we have defended them-we have done so with considerable success-and why we will continue to do so. But it has not been easy. It has not been easy because this issue suddenly exploded on an unsuspecting and totally uninformed Australian public. That is remarkable because one of those facilities had been in this country for two decades and the other one for a decade and a half-Pine Gap and Nurrungar. Why was the public unsuspecting and ill-informed? Whenever the Liberals in government were challenged on this issue and asked to explain what these facilities were about, instead of arguing the moral justification of them-the moral justification which I find unchallengeable; that is why I argue it-they scuttled into some cowardly funk hole stamped 'secrecy'. That is why we had an unprepared public. For the Liberals it was too hard to explain and too difficult to defend, so they retreated to the cowards' defence of secrecy. That is where the genesis of this mindless muddling through, which has epitomised Liberal-National Party administration in foreign affairs, came into being and continues today. We got out there and argued this case. Until Hawke and Hayden and their colleagues got out there and talked about deterrence and about verification and took on by the sharp tusks the opponents they were confronted with, no one had heard that debate in this country and it will continue. But it will continue sensibly because, at the same time, we will pursue that ultimate objective of effective nuclear arms control at mutually stable levels. We support a freeze. We support reductions. We will do all we can to try to work towards that end. It is hard work. It requires great diligence. It requires competent people such as those in the arms control and disarmament branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which scarcely existed before I became Minister for Foreign Affairs. Two officers were working part time on it and now there is the best part of a dozen. Our ambassador for Disarmament in Geneva is working at this. Having said all of those things, I come to the relative measures. Who is the keeper of all this virtue, this patriotic fervour that we have heard so much about in the last few days? We have been hearing about the inviolability of the ANZUS alliance. Only the conservatives know how to behave with the Americans! Let me tell honourable members what Mr Renouf had to say in his book of anecdotal experience, about the visit of the former Prime Minister to the United States of America. He said: The sourness of the relationship between the two governments carried over into 1979 when Prime Minister Fraser accused the US of not adequately protecting Australia's interests in the MTN, a weird charge coming from a man whose professed policy vis-a-vis the US was independence, and hinted that if Australia did not receive treatment in the MTN which she regarded as adequate, the future of the US defence facilities in Australia could be jeopardised. So here we have honourable members opposite applying their form of leverage. It is all right when they engage in a non-virtuous form of conduct, using the description that they have used. That is a principle in itself. It is humbug. ","N/A","WESTERN ALLIANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[31]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/para[2]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

But in the honest recesses of their hearts they know what history has proved-that when the going is tough the best bet is a Labor government. The going does remain tough in the Hunter Valley. Because of its industrial and manufacturing base, the Hunter has been ravaged by unemployment problems. Some towns in the Hunter Valley have unemployment figures double that of the national average. The people of the Hunter electorate, however, welcome the concern that our Government has shown towards the unemployed and they applaud the initiatives that are being taken to generate employment opportunities. I refer to the broadening of the community employment program, the new enterprise initiatives scheme, the increased support for apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship training, work experience opportunities, the community youth support scheme programs and the reforming of labour market programs to give greater emphasis to improved training and works skills development. All these are evidence of the Government's genuine concern for the unemployed and evidence of this Government's determination to act rather than to mouth ineffectually words of sympathy.  The House is aware of the recent crippling train strike in the Hunter Valley and its effect on the nation's credibility at a time when coal and wheat producers are fighting desperately to retain and gain markets and thus ensure employment. As I moved in the House last week, which motion was greeted with a chorus of derision by the Opposition, congratulations are due to those in the Hunter Valley who have come together in a spirit of consensus to create a consultative committee which will work for an early settlement of disputes which are likely to interrupt the passage of coal between mines and ships. The people of the Hunter Valley are deeply appreciative of the Government's commitment to revitalise and restructure our manufacturing industries so as to increase our competitive strength. The buoyancy and viability of our manufacturing and fabricating industries are central to the prosperity of the Hunter electorate. The steel industries assistance plan is crucial to our welfare. Voters in the Hunter Valley well know that, were it not for the Hawke government, there would not be a steel works in Newcastle. The Government has formulated positive policies designed to promote small business opportunities and to stimulate industrial development. In this House I will pursue the development of policy initiatives in that vital area. The electors in the Hunter Valley will endorse this Government's commitment to assist the restructuring and revitalisation of industries in the rural section. Of particular concern to me is the plight of our dairy industry. We have many fine dairy farmers in the Hunter Valley. From meetings I have held with dairymen, I find them to be responsible and sensible. But they are deeply and justifiably worried about the problems confronting them. They and I appreciate the efforts being made by my good friend the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin), who is striving mightily to find solutions to the problems of the dairy industry. Dairymen in the Hunter electorate are aware that the powers of the Federal Minister are restricted by State Government considerations. However, they are delighted that the Minister is prepared to visit Singleton to witness the problems of the industry at first hand and to establish a meaningful dialogue with them.  We all know the problems confronting the man on the land because of the agricultural policies of the European Economic Community, and for other reasons. But it is not to the Opposition's credit that it has deliberately falsified the facts about many rural problems. Opposition members claim that farm incomes are at their nadir when in actual fact farm incomes were at their lowest in 1982-83 when the rural community was being strangled by conservative hands. From 1977 to 1982, under the coalition, farm costs rose by 200 per cent whereas this Government has kept farm costs increases below that of the consumer price index.  Also of great importance to the Hunter electorate are the wine and tourist industries. Members of this House, due to the generosity of Wyndham Estate wines, will have ample knowledge that the Hunter wines-there may be some disagreement-are the best in the world. Vignerons have survived the 10 per cent wine tax but it is important that the industry not be made a milking cow. I urge the Government to take action to protect the Australian wine industry from the dumping of imported wines. However, I will have the opportunity at some future date to speak further on Australian wine protection. I emphasise that the Hunter electorate, because of its wines, its history and its proximity to Sydney, to mention only three factors, has the greatest tourist potential of any area in Australia. We have the visitation figures to back that claim, despite oversights such as that by the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism (Mr John Brown) in failing to allow Paul Hogan to publicise our valley. I point out that these visitation figures have been achieved despite the fact that our roads offer small inducement to tourists to visit our area. In fact, if anything, our roads are a deterrent to visitors. But, after years of neglect by successive Federal coalition governments, the roads in the Hunter electorate lay claim to being among the worst in the nation. It is only now, due to the energetic efforts of the present Minister for Transport and Minister for Aviation (Mr Peter Morris) that a fair proportion of road grants is being allocated to overcome the backlog in road construction which exists in the Hunter Valley. Good roads are necessary for many reasons. Towns such as Merriwa and Denman need good roads to counter isolation. The Hunter needs good roads for the heavy vehicles engaged in industrial and mining works. Good roads would triple the tourist dollar spent in the Hunter and we know the employment value of the tourist dollar. Because the Hunter electorate has virtually no public transport, good roads are even more essential. I turn now to a problem of such proportions that it constitutes nothing less than a national scandal. Because of constraints of time I will refer to this matter but fleetingly as I intend to pursue it at length in a future debate. I refer to a problem which is a major contributor to health and pollution problems in cities and towns in every State of the Commonwealth. Of course, I refer to the tragic backlog of unsewered premises. In this field, as in many others, conservative governments have a disgraceful record. The Whitlam Labor Government's initiatives were the first responsible efforts to eradicate the sewerage problems which exist. In successive Budgets, the Whitlam Government provided nearly $300m to assist the States to eliminate sewerage problems. I congratulate the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), who was the Minister responsible for that magnificent national sewerage program. But, of course, the program was ruthlessly dismantled by the Fraser Government. Not only did the Fraser Government fail to keep its promise to turn on the lights but also it denied hundreds of thousands of Australians the opportunity to pull the chain. I will return to discussion of sewerage problems at an early opportunity to seek assistance for those people in my electorate who are denied an essential health facility. Since my time has almost expired, I can do no more than to say that this Hawke Government is a caring government, a government concerned equally for this nation's youth, its adults and its senior citizens. It will provide a simpler, fairer and more efficient tax scheme. It will give increased assistance to local government authorities. It will provide better opportunities in education, health and transport. Honourable members would not think so to hear some of the debate in this House in recent times, but the Government will also work for international peace. It will eradicate poverty and create a better lifestyle for every Australian. This Government in the Thirty-fourth Parliament will bring to this nation and its people a new hope, a new confidence and a renewed sense of pride and achievement.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[32]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/para[9]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

I note that in the Senate I was criticised for failing to encourage private enterprise in the development of the Tuggeranong town centre. We sold the site to private enterprise for development several months ago at a very substantial profit for the Commonwealth. The problem is that Opposition members do not know what they are talking about. It is worth noting that, despite the statements of the Leader of the Opposition that he will cut billions of dollars from government expenditure, his shadow Minister for Territories has given a solemn undertaking, presumably with his Leader's blessing, that in every area of expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory there will be increased expenditure.

With the co-operation of our Aborigines, and with the means provided in this Bill, we should be able to tap into that heritage and increase the general public awareness of the diversity and depth of Aboriginal culture. Opposition members, despite their support for this Bill, still say time and again that they regard as a right the buying and selling of culture and heritage but it is also something to be interfered with. They acknowledge that there is a right to interfere with it. I go further and say that when a recognised cultural object or contribution is discovered, through a search or whatever, every action should be taken to have it publicly owned by the nation. The honourable member for Sturt made that point very well. Even if it is not owned by the nation, it should be displayed and made available to the people.  State governments are working very well in this direction. Let us take Victoria which, last October, established an Aboriginal resource centre and keeping place at the Museum of Victoria and developed an education program for schools. The education program will be developed in consultation with the Aboriginal community for the general public and for use in Victorian schools. Two of the only three remaining possum cloaks in the world, fragile feather aprons, vegetable fibre basketry and implements, including boomerangs, eel traps, fishing gear, digging sticks and spear throwers are among the several hundred Aboriginal artefacts from south-eastern Australia held by the Museum and displayed in Kershaw Hall. It would be a tragedy for the Aboriginal people, and for Australia, if the possum cloaks and the other items I mentioned were to depart from our shores to overseas collectors. I refer to the position in Queensland. In January this year the Minister, Mr Cohen, announced the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Centre at Rockhampton. I will not dwell on that, except to say that the project will consist of a museum which will display a collection of Aboriginal artefacts already held by the Central Queensland Aboriginal Corporation for Cultural Activities, along with other historical items. The Centre will include an amphitheatre for traditional type dances and displays and an area where tourists can learn the art of boomerang and spear throwing. The object of the Centre is obviously not to have a dead museum, its shelves covered with dust, but to bring the museum alive, to have a living museum and to show that Aboriginal culture is not dead, not a thing of the past, not rooted in a time 40,000 years ago, but that it is still with us, still developing and very much has a future. I received a letter from a constituent who had gone to Victoria and who had visited Kershaw Hall. He wrote: I was most impressed with the many Museum changes, giving a remarkable feeling of vibrant interest and excitement-so different to the stuffy old place of my child-hood memories (late twenties and early thirties). However, I'm mainly writing to express my disappointment and concern over one particular aspect of Museum display-namely Kershaw Hall-having recently been given to understand that this area is to be used by the Victorian Aboriginal Community for the housing of artefacts, special displays et cetera. I'm sure that the Museum can play a most significant role-not only in the preservation of items of Aboriginal cultural heritage, but in the education of children and adults of our community on the life of the original inhabitants of our fine country-and how white settlement affected this culture-and the life and times of Aboriginal people in Victoria today. He goes on, and this is the important part: I do look forward to the time when Kershaw Hall too, will give an `alive' impression, and Aboriginal people, with pride and dignity, will be able to assist all members of our community to learn about their past, present, and future. The point is that the right place to display Aboriginal culture, and to educate Australians about it, is perhaps not in our European-derived style of museums but in a setting which is as close as possible to the setting that existed before the white man came to our shores. I think the Rockhampton project is the way to go. I also mention that during my trip to New Zealand last year I had the opportunity to go to Rotorua and inspect the New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute at Whakarewarewa. I was most impressed with what was happening there. Not only were there artisans and carvers, for which the Maoris are so well known, but also we were able to see a Maori village. We were able to see, in the setting of the sulphur geysers there, the Maori culture and way of life. I would like to see that sort of thing happen in Australia so that the artefacts and culture we are preserving through this Bill are able to be appreciated by the ordinary men and women of Australia. An opportunity exists for a similar cultural setting in Victoria. The Australian Government is about to dispose of the Army School of Health at Healesville. The Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services (Mr Uren) has asked me to convene a consultative committee to advise him on future uses of the school building. We have invited submissions. I understand that the Committee can expect to receive submissions from Aboriginal groups and a combined submission from the Healesville Council. the Victorian Tourism Commission and the Regional Director of Education to establish a living museum adjacent to the world renowned fauna park-the Colin McKenzie Sanctuary at Healesville. Such an arrangement would permit the 300,000 annual visitors to the sanctuary to visit, at the same time, the living museum of Aboriginal culture and heritage. Aboriginal studies for school children would be conducted. The land is most important to the Aboriginal people because it is the site of the old Coranderrk Reserve. It is a suitable setting for such a museum. There could be displays and the sale of modern artefacts to overseas collectors who wanted to see an example, not of heritage, but of its reproduction. What the Minister and this Government have done for Rockhampton, I would like to see them do for Healesville. This Bill and the bicentennial program appear to be ideal vehicles through which to make such a project a reality. Our culture is priceless. It must be identified, retained protected and enjoyed by all Australians. Overall, it must be cherished and shared. This Bill is a big step in achieving these objectives. I commend the Bill to the House. ","N/A","PROTECTION OF MOVABLE CULTURAL HERITAGE BILL 1985","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/para[13]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

It still looks attractive to some but it does not look attractive to very many. As I have been saying for quite a long time, the only people who will opt out are the strong because they can get more.

When the monster of opting out is set free, those who are opting out will be everybody in the highly profitable industries who will do a lot better than they do under indexation. There would then be a surge of leap-frogging in the wages system which has happened previously in Australia, during the days of the Whitlam Government and during the days of the Fraser Government.

Of course there will be pressures on it. Opposition members talk about the superannuation case and align it with the indexation system. It also means under the agreement that if a 3 per cent productivity deal is granted the Government gets no tax clawback. The sacrifice is being made by the Government. If we had given 3 per cent productivity in wages, it would have overcome a lot of problems on the receipt side for the Government, but in terms of meeting the pressures that are building up in the community, one cannot expect 40 to 45 per cent of the people to have superannuation and the other 55 to 60 per cent to forget about it for the rest of their lives. They will not do so. There is an unassailable case for them to establish some form of superannuation in their industry if they can see that the other 45 per cent, basically in the white collar area, are looking after themselves.  Superannuation was on the industrial relations agenda whether we liked it or not. It was a question of how we dealt with it and how we built it into the system. Hopefully, we have built it into the system with as little disputation as possible in a way in which the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has overall surveillance of what will happen so as not to disrupt the Australian economy. When one looks at these things and at the package the Government has put together over three years, obviously one can debate these matters but there have been some achievements. There will have to be a lot of Opposition thinking before it can come forward with a package that may prove to be acceptable to the electorate in replacing what the Government is now doing. I do not see it as any mortal sin of industrial relations that one sits around the table with the trade union movement. We happen to be a highly unionised country. The fact that one can sit around a table and get some agreement about the way this is going to operate seems to bring a touch of sanity rather than be regarded as some vision of capitulation by the Government. I suspect that in the past there have been instances where conservative governments have seen some political value in wanting to show the electorate that they are at loggerheads or at war with the unions. Perhaps they have sought to prolong the debate about union power, union strength-union this, that and the other-but the fact is that if one can harness union reserves in getting their representatives to discuss problems governments will face in this area, which hopefully is what we have been able to do in the last three years, results can be achieved. Union forums, congresses and so on are open and people listen to what is said, and those events are well publicised. The present leaders, Bill Kelty and Simon Crean, are not shrinking violets. They are always on the media explaining their position. I think that we are in a new era in what is happening in industrial relations. It is a sensible one and Australia will benefit from what we have been able to achieve. Points were made in the debate relating to remuneration for Ministers. I think that we are virtually just following the pattern that has been established for many years. There will always be arguments as to whether Ministers are properly paid for the job they do and the hours they put in, but that is a minor part of our occupation here. As I said earlier, I think that more emphasis should be put on the role and the remuneration of back benchers than on the role and remuneration of Ministers. I thank honourable members who have participated in this debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.

The honourable member for Tangney also said that the Waste Watch Committee, in criticising government expenditure, should make sure it did not mention things such as the peace group grants because the youth really believes that those grants are worth while. In other words, he was saying that the Opposition should deceive the youth by not describing the Opposition's real attitude to many of the things it supports. I turn to education. The honourable member for Tangney talked about the number of people who cannot get into education institutions. He did not tell us why that situation has come about. He said that the Opposition would look to increased funds from the business sector or extra students enrolling on a fee paying basis. That is how the Opposition would do it.  To this shoddy document on youth policy which he sent out to Opposition members he attached a questionnaire asking them to come back with further ideas. Question 5 in that questionnaire was: `Are there any special ``tricks'' you have used to raise your profile among young people?'. In other words, Opposition members have not raised their profile by listening to the youth, by talking to the young people of Australia; they have tricked them into believing that they are doing something. If Opposition members had any tricks the honourable member for Tangney wanted to know about them so that all back benchers could embark on a similar exercise. That is the Opposition's policy on youth; it is one of deception, deceit and misinformation.  Let us look at its policy on education which the shadow spokesman put out in February of this year. The Opposition would cure the problem with a new system of awarding free places in higher education to replace the current arrangement. Honourable members should remember that the current arrangement is free education which is unlimited in the terms of the number of places in institutions. In replacing the current system the Opposition would award free places. Obviously the award would be made as a result of some test or examination. There is no indication as to whether it would be means tested. Given the Opposition's attitude on everything else, it would probably not be means tested. So it would mean that many of the people who under its proposals could afford to pay fees would still get the limited free places. What is more, the honourable member goes on to say at the end of his document: . . There are some 390,000 students funded `free' by the government. We will maintain full funding for roughly the same number . . . In other words, under a Liberal government there will never be an increase in the current numbers of free places. No matter how much the population grows in the future the Liberals will keep those numbers where they are. So the only increase that will occur in education under a Liberal government will be in private full fee paying institutions. That is the policy of those opposite and that is not what they are telling the youth of Australia. If there is any doubt as to their policy, let us look at their record in funding because the shadow spokesperson mentioned that some prospective students cannot get a place. In the last full triennium for which those opposite were responsible, the overall funding for higher education was cut-reduced in real terms-by 2.1 per cent. In capital works-that is, the buildings that provide the places at universities and other higher education institutions-the funding was reduced by 73 per cent. In that triennium they were able to provide only some 8,000 new places. Look at the record of our Government in the first full triennium for which we were responsible. Overall funding increased in real terms by 7.6 per cent. Capital works programs are up in real terms by 43 per cent. The number of new places is 36,800-a record that any government would be proud of. But let us take the argument of those opposite about the number of people who missed out on getting into university this year and last year. As the Minister said, there were 10,000 in real numbers last year and the number perhaps will be slightly higher this year. The figure cited by the Opposition member of 30,000 is one which he knows full well takes into account multiple applications for several universities or institutions by people who are hoping to be accepted by at least one.","N/A","HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

The National Party is still silent because it is terrified of Joh. He has most members' pre-selections in his pocket. They will go down the drain as soon as they utter one word of criticism about Joh in Queensland. The Leader of the National Party received an overwhelming vote of confidence in Wagga Wagga-87 to 58. On the Australian Broadcasting Corporation news on Sunday he said. `Have I had a great day today'. He was wiping the sweat from his brow. He said: `I have absolutely floored them'. But the other resolution was carried. They still want Joh down here in his job. So the motion was carried overwhelmingly by a margin of 87 to 58. What a great victory for this person who has been in the Parliament for 25 years-this great leader of the National Party, this great tactician, who, with his deputy went into his Party room last week, twice, and said: `Come on fellows, give me a vote of confidence'. Did they give him the raspberry! They said: `You must be joking; you are lucky to have a job at all, let alone get votes of confidence'. There are a lot of people who want the right honourable member's job; it is not only Joh. Personally, I do not think Joh will ever come here but he has all the Opposition members terrified. If they are not terrified why will they not tell us their policies?  Everybody who earns less than $600 a week will be worse off under the plan being put forward by the nut from Kingaroy. The Opposition is talking about a 9.4 per cent tax, yet it has no wages policy. The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, who is the shadow Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, sits opposite smiling at us. That is all right, I do not mind looking at his smiles. I just wish he would tell us what his wages policy is. I have been looking at a media statement from the Confederation of Australian Industry. Honourable members should see what it has to say about those who want to destroy the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The CAI approves of refining the Act, but it says: . . this is a very different thing from those who would do away with the system in its entirety. Their arguments however have nothing to support them but their own personal opinions and in fact represent a grave danger to employers. They advocate massive change with its commensurate risk of massive dislocation, without providing any clear idea as to how this change will be brought about nor any evidence that it will in the end be better for employers. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) is quite right. He made that brilliant 12-page speech about the Liberal Party which everyone in this House should read. This is one of the reasons why the Opposition cannot get a policy. The honourable member for Boothby pointed out to everybody in the Liberal Party that up until Christmas the Leader of the Opposition had as his chief of staff Dr Gerard Henderson. The Leader of the Opposition cannot be responsible for everything that Dr Henderson says but it was noticeable that as soon as Dr Henderson left the staff of the Leader of the Opposition he began writing all these articles in the Australian. He said that the honourable member for Boothby, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton), the late Senator Missen, Senator Puplick and the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) really had no place in the Liberal Party. Would it not be nice to have freedom of information applying to the office of the Leader of the Opposition? Would it not be nice to look at the memos which Dr Henderson sent to him about some of his colleagues during the two years he was chief of staff? Then the Leader of the Opposition said: `I will stick by the Liberal Party. I will not sell the Liberal Party out. This issue is far too important.' However, for two years he sat there listening to Dr Henderson telling him that these people were not worthy of their positions in the Liberal Party. That is why the Liberals cannot formulate a policy-because the honourable member for Boothby, the honourable member for Higgins and others on that side of the House who have a rational view about Australian institutions and do not want them destroyed will not put their hands up for all the reactionary right wing madness that is flowing through the veins of the National and Liberal parties in Australia today. That is why the Liberals cannot tell us what they will do with all these programs. They go to the universities and tell the kids that they will do away with the administration fee. They go to the stock exchange and tell the people there that they will do away with capital gains tax. They go to the wine and grape growers and tell them that they will do away with the brandy excise. But when they get together these matters are never all packaged up. They have to sneak around Australia hoping that little interest groups will believe their promises. The Opposition is an absolute rabble and it is about time this Parliament said it was a rabble and condemned it for its inability-and this is the first time for any Opposition since Federation-to give us any insight into what it intends to present to the Australian people.

But, of course, that is a long while ago. The number of small `l' liberals to be found on the opposite side of this House could be counted virtually on the fingers of my left hand, because they have simply ceased to exist as a dominant force within the conservative party and the coalition today. That is why the word `fairness' and the concept of public expenditure, in terms of having any merit at all, lack currency and form in terms of current conservative philosophy. Opposition members are not liberals. They are radical conservatives; they are Tories who are interested in ensuring that society works in favour of the greedy rather than the needy. They are interested not in protecting the interests of the people who are workers. That is indicated by their taxation policy, which is clearly geared towards the interests of people on the very high incomes; but it is even more clearly demonstrated by the attitudes expressed by the previous speaker in relation to wages policy.  The policy of the conservative Opposition in this country is one of denying wage increases irrespective of economic circumstances and irrespective of any capacity within the economy to pay. Irrespective of circumstances, at every wage case in recent years honourable members opposite have advocated a nil increase. They have never conceded at all that workers ought to share in the very significant growth in productivity that has occurred. In terms of the concept of market deregulation what honourable members opposite are concerned about is introducing a level of industrial conflict within this country which we have not seen, certainly since the 1930s. They are interested in introducing to industrial relations a notion of confrontation because they believe that the collective power of the corporate sector would be sufficient to ensure that any reduction in living standards in this country would be borne not only by people on wages but also often by people within those sectors of industry which struggle to pay the highest wages. Of course, that means a reduction in family living standards, which takes us in the direction of reducing the living standards of people who can least afford to have their standards of living decline. In terms of the Government's policy, we recognise that this country has been going through a very difficult period. We reject any notion that the difficulties that currently are being experienced in macro terms within this society reflect anything more than very basic changes in external conditions which have imposed a very heavy burden on the living standards of this country. We recognise that these are serious problems which need to be addressed. But I repeat: They need to be addressed in a way which expresses some commitment to some sort of fairness. During this very difficult period, and despite very significant cuts in real wages within this country, we have had the best industrial relations record of any government since the war. The reason for this is that we have been perceived to be moderately fair. We have been seen to be concerned to ensure that there is a reasonable and fair distribution in terms of income and wealth within the community. That is why we have had to take measures which, although tough, have been accepted. They are accepted because they are fair. On the other hand, we have this absurd proposition being peddled, again in very general terms, that it is possible to achieve a massive cut in the tax burden borne by the wealthiest people in the community at the same time as reducing wages significantly and cutting back on the public sector. This inevitably means a cutback in the area of the social wage and areas such as income security, education and health. It is the proposition that we can achieve a cutback in those areas at the same time as wages are reduced and at the same time as there is a negative redistribution in terms of taxation. What that adds up to is the creation of a society in which unfairness and greed are constantly rewarded and in which real need within the community is ignored.

That is the very next thing that they will do. They will privatise it, give it away, and introduce a voucher system so that those of some wealth can use little vouchers. I notice that Senator Messner, who is in the gallery, is nodding in total agreement. He agrees that the Opposition will sell the education system, get rid of the cost of it so as to save $1 billion. I thank Senator Messner for agreeing with me. I know that that is what members of the Opposition will do. I hope that everyone here has noted that the good senator agrees with me. They will give vouchers so that the wealthy can skip along to their private schools and get the same per capita grant as the poor. This is their equity and their fairness. They are a wonderful, mystical lot of people. They talk so much about the family. We heard the honourable member for Mackellar express concern about the poor. Yes, they show a great deal of concern for the poor! They will sell the education system to private enterprise and then they will reduce family incomes. They intend to have a three-year wages freeze. I hope that the honourable member for Mackellar can answer me in this House because I would like to know. He talked about all the increases that Australians face-mortgage increases, food price increases, education and health cost increases. How can he equate his mealy-mouthed expression of concern with the fact that he intends to freeze wages for three years? He says he is concerned for families, yet he intends to increase those costs and give those families a three-year wages freeze. I do not think he is concerned; I think he is a fraud and a phoney and so are all the Opposition members.  Apart from doing all that to families, the Opposition will sell Australia to the highest bidder. It does not matter to whom it sells Australia, but when the first bidder comes along it will sell. Let us be honest about this: We know who the highest bidder will be. There is only one country in the world with the money to buy Australia-Japan. That is exactly what the Premier of Queensland-the Opposition's unknown hero, the one it will not talk about in this place-has been doing to Queensland. He has been selling it to the Japanese. That is the Opposition's plan. It will take the yen for Australia. It cannot run away from that fact. When Opposition members say that they will abolish all controls on foreign enterprise in Australia they know that there is only one country in the world that can afford to buy-Japan. I wonder what Mr Ruxton will say about that. I never hear Mr Ruxton concern himself about the fact that this country is losing control to the Japanese and that is what Opposition members want to support. Mr Ruxton never talks about that. Opposition members will sell Australia for yen. I wonder what they will do next. Then of course the Opposition parties will privatise. That is the secret agenda of members of the Liberal Party-the very secret agenda. They will do what Maggie Thatcher has done in Britain. They will balance their Budget every year by selling off the assets of every Australian. They will sell the Commonwealth Bank for a start. Opposition members should be honest about this. We have given them the chance to debate this matter; they have had the time tonight. They should come clean and be honest. But they cannot do so. They cannot stand up in this House and give us their private agenda; they cannot come clean and tell the rest of Australia what they plan. We know that the Opposition parties will sell the Commonwealth Bank and Telecom Australia. We know what will happen then. Every Australian farmer will face an extra $1,000 on costs. We do not see the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and other National Party members who express concern for farmers running around the place and saying: `What will happen to the farmer when we sell Telecom?'. They do not really care. After all, the white-shoe brigade from the Gold Coast are their new gurus; they are the people to whom National Party members now pay obeisance. Those are the people who will fund the massive billions of dollars for their next election campaign. Joh will come down with his fistful of dollars and look after you. That is the sort of campaign that we will get. Honourable members opposite talk a load of nonsense when they come into this House. Why are they not honest enough to give us their policies? Why will they not come into this House and tell the Australian public and the Parliament what they plan to do about taxation? Why are they not honest enough to lay out a policy on health care? Why are they not honest enough to come into this House and tell us what they intend to privatise? Why do they not tell Australian families some decent truths for a change and tell them exactly where they stand in this whole debate. The answer is that either they cannot or they are dishonest. Those are the only possible solutions-either they have no policies whatsoever or they do not have enough courage to reveal their secret agenda in debate in this place. I suspect it is the latter. As the coalition's historical antecedents have shown to the people of this country in their years of government, they will go on the path of deceit. They will not debate fairness or equity; they will go down the path of deceit, as they have always done historically as parties. They will deceive the Australian people and destroy them should we ever have the disastrous luck to see them back in power. Opposition members are a hopeless lot.

When we talk about tax in this Parliament Opposition members say that they will abolish capital gains tax. They have a strange notion about capital. They somehow think that those who have the capacity to take earnings in other than earned income should not pay tax. That is the argument they put forward. They say that those who have the capacity to use the stock market, property or other forms of investment which one could call capital under the terms of the Income Tax Assessment Act should not pay tax on the gains. That is a strange notion and Opposition members are quite prepared to give their friends those perks again. They are simply saying that those who gain economic wealth through one form of activity should gain that economic wealth and power without tax because it is not earned income, a salary or a wage. That is what they are saying when they attack the capital gains tax. They say that those people who invest in property, shares and other forms of capital should not pay tax. I would like to hear some arguments from one of the simplistic members opposite on these matters. I would like to hear why someone who invests income in an interest bearing investment account and who pays tax on the proceeds should pay that tax while someone who invests in a non-income earning capital investment, such as a rental property, should make a gain on the property but not pay tax on it. Why should a person who chooses one form of investment because that person does not need an income receipt at the time, and makes an accretion to economic wealth, not pay tax while a person who has less financial capacity and invests in an income earning asset such as a bank account or a fixed term deposit is disadvantaged?

He advocates an increase in taxes. Opposition members are running around the place suggesting that they can cut taxes. They could have a $14 billion deficit, yet they still say they will cut taxes. Not one of them could lie straight in bed. The article continues:  `I am devastated by the commitment of a great number of people to the belief that there is some solution in major tax reductions . . . That is the sort of stuff the Opposition is peddling. It believes that some magical, mystical solution to our problems can be brought about simply, by a tax reduction. This is the solution that President Reagan has inflicted upon the American economy. The Americans are printing money on their presses 24 hours a day. They cut taxes on a false notion and then they start printing money madly. That is the Opposition's solution. What does Professor Galbraith say about these weird notions of cutting taxes? He says: This is a form of mysticism that adult people should not tolerate. I do not tolerate it. Where does that leave members of the Opposition? It leaves them in infant childhood; they still have not grown up. He goes on to say: As adults we should be willing, when demand presses on supply, when deficits are structural in our economy, to meet the task of appropriate increases in taxes. But the Opposition is going to cut them. The professor continues: I don't find myself coming as an advocate of the newest panacea, namely the flat tax.

Those instrumentalities that we have will have to be made available to the public. If Opposition members were on the treasury bench they would have to do the same. There is money in Australia. This Government has encouraged the influx of foreign money. There are extra banks here now. We have the money to be able to do things. Our little people, those who want their superannuation to be not taxed but invested in a little bit of interest in their own country, will take up the shares and buy out and assist in the running of these enterprises. Let us put them on a competitive basis with the rest of free enterprise throughout Australia; but let us do it carefully.  I was never opposed to deregulation completely. I have always believed that there must be some form of cross-subsidisation where necessary. Primarily that has been the responsibility of government-owned enterprises, because we have managed them. There is some responsibility when it comes to cross-subsidisation in private enterprise. Maybe the Trade Practices Commission can have some kind of influence or say on this matter; government legislation certainly can. I do not think that we want to get away completely from a reasonable point of view. This has been a very wide-ranging debate, so I shall conclude my remarks by commenting on the Ansett takeover of East-West Airlines. The Trade Practices Commission has told Ansett that it must divest itself of at least five services in New South Wales-Armidale, Grafton, Kempsey, Port Macquarie and Taree. I am particularly interested in Port Macquarie and Taree, and my friends the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson) and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) are certainly interested in Grafton and the other services concerned. The fact is that it was well over three months ago that Ansett was told that it had to dispose of those services. The local people want to know what is happening. We want to know what is happening. We have spoken with the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Commissioner McComas. Undoubtedly all the honourable members concerned have spoken with Australian Airlines and the executive of Ansett-I have done so-and other airlines that may be interested, and have conferred with their local authorities with respect to these runs. The Trade Practices Commission itself wished Australian Airlines to take them over. Australian Airlines was, I believe, not enthusiastic about taking them over because it could not see itself clear in acquiring the aircraft and running the services. So today it is perhaps supporting another smaller line that will feed into it to be able to provide the services. As my time is short, let me sum this matter up by saying that the important factor about it is that there might not be any of those particular runs that will pay for themselves and provide a profit at present. That is why I raise the matter of some form of cross-subsidisation. There is a potential in the years to come, with efficient management, for those lines to become viable. That is the important thing. They will be viable. I am sure that the services to Grafton, Port Macquarie Taree and Kempsey will be viable because of the great growth of population and people who want to use air facilities. Their cost is high at present, but if they are viable and there is a bit of competition around, I am sure that prices will come down in time.

What does the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale), have to say about the last extension of the two-airline policy? Opposition members say, `The Labor Government will deregulate the airlines', but these so-called free marketeers were the ones who entrenched the legislation.  Let me tell the House what my perspective is on the capital requirements of Australian Airlines and compare my views, coming from the electorate of Chifley, with those of someone who comes from another electorate, say the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). One of the highest priorities in the electorate of Chifley is education. We have the Nepean College of Advanced Education in the electorate of Lindsay, and more recently the Chifley University has been set in train, something which the Liberal-National Party Opposition refused to endorse in the last election. Let us consider the perceptions of someone in the ACT and maybe I will be able to explain the different views I have in looking at the capital requirements of Australian Airlines. The ACT has some of the wealthiest electors in Australia. It has the highest education retention rates and they are increasing. It has a magnificent university and college of advanced education (CAE), and that university gets top level recurrent funding. The CAE in my area is subject to rapid growth but it is operating on a shoestring. We have a new university which requires some $600m in funding, but we have one of the lowest retention rates in secondary and higher education. I do not deny, as the paper that has been distributed by the Minister for Transport and Communications Support (Mr Peter Morris) suggests, that Australian Airlines requires a capital injection. My perspective is that I do not want to see my constituents suffer in terms of their access to education, whether it be secondary or university, because of a decision made to fund Trans-Australia Airlines and not to fund or to cut back on the university capital works that are required. It is important that we continue Australian Airlines in government ownership, but I cannot see any difficulty in the proposition-and this is yet to be decided-that we ought to explore other opportunities for the injection of capital. On the issue of government controls, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Wentworth, this is a serious question in relation to quite a number of statutory authorities and trading authorities. It is clear that if we want board accountability, if we want efficiency and effectiveness in the services delivered by these organisations we have to lift some of these controls. It is interesting to note that in all the years of conservative government those opposite never really had a rational approach to government trading enterprises. It is this Government that has undertaken a thorough review of these bodies, and in particular I refer to the review on the impact of these controls on successful operations. I have much sympathy for what the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) suggested in his speech on 22 February when he talked about the need to examine the scope for removal of other broader controls on the operations of Australian Airlines. He ran through Loan Council borrowings, industrial relation co-ordination, restriction on superannuation arrangements, and the tying of executives' salaries to the Remuneration Tribunal. We have to understand and to come to grips with the fact that we cannot lay down some solution that will fit every trading authority. We need to examine and consider this issue case by case. Certainly, Ansett's current success-and I acknowledge its success; I have talked about market share-is broadly a function of its vertical and horizontal integration of other services. It is doing that very well and this gives it an advantage. There is competition at the moment and there will be further competition when we deregulate and open up the airline industry. It is clear to me that there has to be a significant movement for Australian Airlines on the issue of controls.  I am suggesting that the incorporation of Australian Airlines into a company is a very important step because it signals some of the changes the Government will make. Unlike Opposition members, I point out that an advisory committee is reviewing this matter. The shadow Minister for Transport and Communications never fails to denigrate this committee, which is due to report in March. It is regrettable that the Opposition denigrates the individuals on this committee because, clearly, in order to be successful, any government, whether Labor or conservative, requires people to serve in advisory capacities on a number of committees. People certainly give of their time and expertise to make a valuable input. I think it is unhelpful for members of this House, and certainly shadow Ministers, to denigrate the character and integrity of those people. I am confident, unlike the Opposition and the shadow spokesman, that this report will be a significant one and that it will assist the Government to come to grips with some of the issues that it has to face in relation to Australian Airlines and further deregulation.  I may be wrong, but I suspect that no member of the Opposition, in wishing to denigrate the position of Australian Airlines and in suggesting that the only successful model is completely to sell off Australian Airlines lock, stock and barrel, has mentioned East-West Airlines Ltd. That airline certainly provided some cheaper fares. Of course, what has not been said is that the airline was forced to sell out because it was losing money at quite a significant rate. I make the point that the companies that have failed since the Australian National Airlines Commission, or Trans-Australia Airlines, was set up, have always been in the private sector. They are the companies that successively have had to be bailed out. Australian National Airways-the old ANA-was bailed out by Ansett because it was losing money and had gone broke. Special legislation was rushed through the Victorian Parliament so that Ansett could not be taken over by TNT Ltd. Finally, TNT and News Corporation Ltd got together to buy that company out. I am quite happy to acknowledge that the management that has been put into Ansett Airlines of Australia has resulted in Ansett certainly being a much better performing company now than it was under the old management. I guess we are trying in this Bill to free up Australian Airlines to allow it to compete on equal terms. I would like to refer again to the capital requirement of Australian Airlines. Because I come from an electorate in the western suburbs of Sydney, I may have a slightly different perspective on the issue of capital injection. But it is entirely appropriate that the Government should not make any decisions on this issue until it has heard from its advisory committee in March.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN AIRLINES (CONVERSION TO PUBLIC COMPANY) BILL 1987","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/para[5]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

But now, today, apparently because the realisation of the contemptible estimation in which they are held has sunk in, they thought, `Well, gee, we shall have to have a censure motion'. If we look back over all of the censure motions that have ever been moved in this House we would never find one so insubstantially based and so unconvincingly put as the one which is currently before the House.  Before I do anything else, let me establish at the outset the double standards, the sheer hypocrisy, on this question of privacy and the protection of privacy which has characterised the performance of this Opposition in this Parliament in the last two weeks. I think there will be the recollection in the minds of all honourable members of just what we went through last week. What happened last week? The Opposition pursued the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate. Why did the Opposition pursue him? It was because he properly refused to disclose confidential Australian Federal Police information. That was the Minister's stance-that he had been provided with advice from the Federal Police, advice which went to the affairs of a citizen, and on all the precedent and on the strict advice of the Federal Police, Senator Tate said, `I am not going to disclose confidential information which goes to the individual'. That was the Opposition's standard of principle last week: the Minister was to be condemned because he would not disclose confidential information. Now this week it is saying that this man, this honourable Minister, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), is to be condemned and made the subject of a censure motion because he has done so. Where is the Opposition? If honourable members want at the outset some more proof of the Leader of the Opposition's pathetic hypocrisy it is this: he talked not only about law but also, would you believe it, morality. That gentleman came in and talked about morality. Impliedly criticising the Solicitor-General for the meanness and tightness of his script, he says, `You may have been saved by a Solicitor-General who is not competent, but if you have been saved by an incompetent Solicitor-General you stand condemned on moral grounds'. So says the Leader of the Opposition. Who is this man to talk of morality from this insubstantial basis and platform? Who in history of this country has gone to the people seeking to become Prime Minister on a more massive platform of lies than this gentleman did in July last year? When he was involved in the 1983 election he was associated with one of the most massive lies about the deficit facing this country. Subsequently, he was exposed as having lied, and lied massively, to this country about the extent-- ","N/A","PRIME MINISTER","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

There can be no question about that. The moral case of the Opposition has been founded on what it believes to be its strong stand in principle on the issue of rights to privacy. If the Opposition wants to take that stand, it is entitled to have examined its record in this place on that matter since it has been established as an Opposition. Virtually since the Opposition's inception it has tried to get successive Ministers to expose in this place matters of sensitivity relating to private rights of individuals. As Special Minister of State, I had occasion to experience that for month after month when Opposition members made inquiries as to the procedures of police investigations. Opposition members never accepted from me the argument that the people who were the object of those inquiries had a right to privacy until charged.

They did it quite cleverly on occasions, but they did get out the names of persons concerned in those inquiries, who then got blackguarded anyway even though subsequently nothing happened to them. Of course, it has been the direct personal experience of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) that one such event occurred to his family. So, we can look at Opposition members' offences against rights to privacy. They have been successful in ensuring that privacy has been overthrown.  Whatever else one may say about this situation, one thing stands absolutely clear: there was never an intention on anybody's part to expose people's private positions. There was never any intention at any point of time to expose individuals. In fact, the opposite was the case; there was a determination that the rights of people would be protected in that regard, and constant advice and assurance were sought that this would be the case. The position is that the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) gets his information from a much wider variety of sources than just the Health Insurance Commission. Yet not once has the honourable member for Canning sought to bring into any public forum, either here under the right of parliamentary privilege or outside in the general community, the information that has come into his possession on specific cases of doctors involved in overcharging. In this regard, too, no exposure has been given to any matter in a public forum that would enable identification to be made of the doctors in this case. There we have the contrasting positions. We have seen the position of members of the Liberal Party Opposition on privacy when it relates to matters which it suits them to raise in this place. They will do it again; we can be absolutely certain that, before this Parliament is out in a couple of years time, there will be instances when they will come in here and argue that the right of the public to know overrides the right to privacy. They will do that as sure as night follows day. There will be a 24-hour memory applying to that, as there has been in the case before us today. So let us dismiss from the outset the sort of extreme unction with which the Opposition has pursued its policy on the issue of privacy. It is absolute cant. We now come to the question of the responsibility of Ministers and where Ministers ought to be entitled to sit while investigations are under way into matters concerning their departments. What we have here is a dramatic instance of double standards which the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) sought to glide over lightly. He chose to make an exception for the position of a former Minister for Primary Ministry in the meat substitution case. He sought to glide over that by saying that in that case the Minister had tendered his resignation and had it rejected. I remind the right honourable gentleman that in this censure motion we are not discussing the position of the Minister for Community Services and Health. The reason we are not discussing the position of the Minister is that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) shot his bolt last night by moving a censure motion against him, without information, and therefore under Standing Orders the Opposition cannot move another in this place. That is how sensibly members of the Opposition pursue the parliamentary procedures. That is why that matter cannot be considered here today. The question was asked: `But what did the Prime Minister do about it?' The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) did precisely nothing.

The Leader of the Opposition managed to come in here and say that the legal opinion of the Solicitor-General in no way countered anything that members of the Opposition had said in this regard last night. What nonsense! I had to sit here through their miserable performances last night. They repeatedly suggested in this place that the Minister was directly legally culpable. They were not wandering around the place saying that he was not directly legally culpable but only morally culpable-which is what they have been arguing here today. Today they do not dare argue against the position of the Solicitor-General on whether or not the Minister is legally culpable. They have decided to skid over the question of legal culpability and move to asserting that perhaps he is morally culpable for the administration of affairs in his Department. I have already dealt with that issue and where Opposition members stand on such interpretations. They have been effectively answered in that regard.  They have also been answered in regard to the Minister's administration of his Department both on the question of privacy and on the sort of advice tendered to the Minister. I will go through that again because I think it is appropriate here. It is worth while reminding the House and anybody who happens to be listening of exactly what the Managing Director had to say. He said: Last year the Commission supplied your office with information about the charging behaviour of a sample of different specialist groups and this information was the basis of Mr Gear's public statements. The information supplied to your office did not identify either the doctors or their patients. It was in the form of statistical data which may be released by the Commission where the information does not identity an individual patient or practitioner (Section 135 (5) of the Health Insurance Act refers). This is the section under which statistical information is provided to requesting organisations including the Australian Medical Association. I suggest that that is not a bad position on which a Minister can stand on the question of whether he has properly exercised his responsibilities. He asked whether the data that had been passed via his office to the honourable member for Canning was appropriate within the framework of the Act under which the Health Insurance Commission operates. He got back the advice from the people concerned with this-well before it had become a matter of public dispute in this place-and the advice was that it emphatically was. This morning the Leader of the Opposition found himself dancing on the spit prepared for him by George Negus, who began to get to the nub of the matter, which is the extent to which the Leader of the Opposition ought to be taken seriously on this. The interviewer, George Negus, persistently put this point to him: But the public might like to know whether or not the information rather than the names of the doctors is true, that some doctors in fact have been charging six times the scheduled fee-isn't that in the long run as great a concern to the public as what you're saying? The Leader of the Opposition danced around that question. Negus came back with the question: Isn't it reasonable to blackguard doctors if they're charging six times the fee? Then the Leader of the Opposition said: It is reasonable to give legitimate information, but is it legitimate to selectively leak information? The Leader of the Opposition conceded to Negus that it was legitimate to give legitimate information. What advice did the Minister for Community Services and Health have? The advice was that what his office had was legitimate information. That was the position on which the Minister was operating-the fact that he had received legitimate information. The Opposition cannot get away from that fact. It was recognised by the Minister, before anybody on the other side of the chamber had recognised it, that there was a possibility that the information that had been supplied to him may have been flawed. That is why he took the action he did the other day. He took that appropriate action immediately, in a timely way, and not under pressure to ensure that his administration of the position was appropriate. In addition to that, he has put in train an appropriate investigation into affairs in his Department that will arrive at a conclusion that a Minister should, obviously, actively seek. The Prime Minister has done his duty in seeking to inform himself on whether the Minister for Community Services and Health committed any legal breaches. He has received that information. He has done all that is required of him. The Minister for Community Services and Health in this affair has done all that is required of him in his efforts to protect both the public interest and the interests of the private individuals concerned. There is no case for censure. We can dismiss this motion out of hand. I move: That the question be now put. Question put. Original question put: That the motion (Mr Howard's) be agreed to.

I have looked at the arguments put forward by Opposition members. Where is there one tittle of evidence to show that there is uncertainty amongst Australian Airlines' employees as to their future as a result of the provisions of this Bill? The structure of this legislation makes their future more certain and clear and is in marked contrast to the mess that was created by the Fraser Government when it introduced the legislation which it could not implement.  The final allegation in the second reading amendment states that we are to be condemned for: the continuing poor administration of Australia's aviation infrastructure. The fact is that this Government has taken positive steps to improve aviation arrangements and administration over the past five years. Firstly, the Government moved very quickly to implement the Bosch Report of the Independent Inquiry into Aviation Cost Recovery for the use of aviation infrastructure. This ended the subsidisation by taxpayers of aviation infrastructure which prevailed until that time. Secondly, the Government has moved to end the two-airline policy from 1990 and to open the domestic aviation industry to competition from that time. Thirdly, the Government has vested the operation of major airports in the Federal Airports Corporation to ensure that these airports are operated on a commercial basis. Fourthly, the Government has announced the establishment of a Civil Aviation Authority with effect from 1 July 1988. The Authority will take responsibility for the efficient operation of the airways system from that time, while ensuring primarily that the safety function is maintained. Therefore, the Government has taken all the necessary steps to ensure that domestic aviation arrangements and infrastructure are administered in the most appropriate way. I will not argue, nor can any honourable member argue, that there are not considerable challenges that have to be met in terms of the future of the airline industry. But the record shows that there has been more real achievement in the administration of this important area under the Hawke Government than has happened in years gone by. There are many achievements, but there is still much to be done. Again, if one looks at the record, there is no way at all that this House would be justified in endorsing a second reading amendment which speaks of the `continuing poor administration of Australia's aviation infrastructure'. That is nonsense and honourable members opposite know that it is nonsense. There is one other matter that I should point out. In the course of this debate the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) raised concerns about the Trade Practices Commission's decision to require TNT-News Ltd to divest itself of certain routes operated by East-West Airlines following the takeover of East-West. I am informed, and for the information of honourable members I inform the House, that in a Press release issued today Australian has declined offers from Ansett Airlines of Australia to purchase at a premium the East-West Pilbara and Skywest Airlines Pty Ltd Jetstream operations in Western Australia, which were part of the Trade Practices Commission's divestment order. I felt it desirable to inform honourable members of that in the course of this debate. In conclusion, I believe that many challenges lie ahead of this Parliament in determining the whole future of the aviation industry. I congratulate the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, because I believe that he has not for one moment lacked the resolve to face up to the very difficult policy challenges that lie in this area. He has confronted them and brought into the Senate and the Parliament proposals which face up to those challenges and provide, where necessary, legislative procedures, of which this is one, which will ensure the future of this industry and reassure the travelling public that ultimately we will have a structure that will ensure not only the very high level of safety of which all Australians can be proud, but also an industry which will provide the most effective, efficient and low cost service to all our citizens.

We ought to contrast the real position of someone like the honourable member for Mackellar and that of the Government. There is a commitment to elitism on the part of the Opposition, this hard ideological position that Opposition members are happy to embrace. For example, it is clear that retention rates in private schools are way above those in public schools. It is that sort of disparity which the Opposition, through its policies, seeks to entrench. I think that the real issue is that we ought to be saying about all young Australians that they have the capacity and capability to do well in education and that they should not be forced into private education or any other type of education for that matter. I shall return to that point, but I want to link up some remarks with Austudy.  When Austudy was introduced there was much concern because it is an age-related measure; it is dependent on how old one is rather than at what stage of schooling one is. But in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory many students commence Year 11 when they are 15 years old. It was believed that this would act as a disincentive to their continuing with their education. I have a table of school participation rates for Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory and Australia as a whole. From these statistics one can see that such a disincentive is not operating. Whilst I accept that those fears were genuine, statistically such a disincentive is not being shown. I seek leave, Mr Deputy Speaker, to incorporate that table in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read as follows- SCHOOL PARTICIPATION RATES 15 year-olds 1986 1987 Change (% age points) 16 year-olds 1986 1987 Change (% age points) New South Wales... 92.1 92.2 +0.1 62.9 65.8 +2.9 Victoria... 92.0 93.3 +1.3 77.9 78.8 +0.9 Tasmania... 96.8 97.3 +0.5 51.0 53.6 +2.6 Australian Capital Territory (a)... 100.2 102.2 +2.0 85.9 89.3 +3.4 Queensland... 85.1 86.5 +1.4 63.4 66.9 +3.5 South Australia... 88.9 92.0 +3.1 67.0 69.7 +2.7 Western Australia... 83.1 84.0 +0.9 57.6 58.8 +1.2 Northern Territory... 72.1 76.5 +4.4 49.8 55.1 +5.3 Australia... 89.8 90.9 +1.1 66.8 69.0 +2.2 ","N/A","STUDENT ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1987","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/para[1]","N/A","N/A","N/A"

This is something that the farm lobbies are whipping up pretty well now. The very simple fact is that a wages market is never a purely competitive market. If we had deregulated wages now, we would have a wage blow-out of the order that we had in this country in 1974 and 1981, both of which virtually blew a lot of the manufacturing sector out of the water. The reality is that the sort of market we get in wages never ratchets down. Even in the depression, both nominal and real wages never came down. There would also be massive exploitation. The fruitpickers award in Queensland is $231 per week. There is no overaward payment, because of the Queensland system. Council workers also get about $281 per week. The Opposition wants big increases in parliamentary salaries. I ask Opposition members whether they live on $231 per week. If we had wage deregulation, the exploitation in this country in some labour markets would be even worse than it is in the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne.  We come now to borrowings and debt. For the first time in 35 years, there is a nil public sector borrowing requirement. The Commonwealth Government puts no demand on the public purse-for the first time in 35 years. These borrowings are mainly by the private sector, with some by State and local government authorities. The Opposition is against the North West Shelf; it is against development. That is what all the borrowings are about. The Opposition talks about the Foreign Investment Review Board. What is the Opposition's policy on the FIRB? The policy is to wipe it out. Yet it is saying that it has to undertake more scrutiny. The next thing that the honourable member for Maranoa touched on was wheat. He talked about the stabilisation fund. There is no stabilisation fund. I think it has been about 20 years since there was one. There is an underwriting scheme. The Commonwealth Government paid out under that scheme some $200m. Of course, that is what the underwriting scheme was there for when the world price of wheat collapsed with the United States of America export enhancement program. But the Commonwealth Government stands behind the wheat industry with $1.1 billion national interest cover, a complete loan guarantee for all its finance for the first advance, and now, with the new plan coming in, an additional loan guarantee so that it can get into the domestic market rather than being excluded from it. The honourable member talked about beef acquisitions. Five abattoirs have been bought with Japanese investment. Midcoast, on the north coast of New South Wales, was in receivership. The Japanese bought into it and kept it going. Lockley had come down to a small animal works. It was no longer a real meatworks in the export sense. There has been 30 per cent Japanese investment in Gilbertsons, and that will place Gilbertsons in a very good position to get into the Japanese market. Two Japanese people invested in Kilcoy. Oakey is the only one which I think has some bad aspects to it. The Opposition talks about criteria. I will give the four criteria.

Both anti-discrimination and affirmative action legislation are specifically designed to provide an avenue for a particular group-in this case women-to achieve equality. They recognise that equality has been denied previously and that certain actions need to be undertaken to overcome the existing barriers to full equality for women. The general principles of equality have been canvassed by the High Court, as I said previously, and specifically by Justice Brennan.  As the honourable member for Forde indicated, it is important that we recognise today as International Women's Day. She gave what I thought to be a very erudite summary of the history of International Women's Day. In 1986 the Government introduced the Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Act in recognition of the fact that there are structural factors preventing women from enjoying the same employment opportunities as men. They are not factors based on any inherent capacity or skill, or any inability. It was also formal recognition of the fact that government has an essential role to play in legislating to reverse these structural barriers. The legislation signifies a recognition of the role that women have to play in society and the fact that society is better off as a consequence of women being able to utilise their skills and make a contribution that they feel is significant to our community. This legislation covers both higher education institutions and all private sector organisations with 100 employees or more. It is the only affirmative action legislation affecting private sector employers. The first reports from this legislation are now starting to come in. In November of last year about 99 per cent of the 233 private sector companies with over 1,000 employees lodged reports detailing the status of their women employees. In May of this year firms with between 500 and 999 employees are due to lodge similar reports and start affirmative action programs. This amendment relates specifically to the changes in higher education institutions which result from the Government's education policy and it seeks to ensure that where institutions amalgamate, the continuity of affirmative action programs, developments and reporting requirements will be preserved. The Bill provides for transitional arrangements to preserve affirmative action program development and those reporting requirements. The fact that inequality of women is structurally based means that there is a range of factors that need to be addressed to give women the real choices to reassess and change the position they hold and want to hold in society. The changing of the position of women requires a multi-faceted strategy, one which-I am proud to say-this Government has adopted. It must address the economic position of women within our community. It must address women's health issues, educational issues, employment and training issues, and the obvious and very important issue of child care. This Government's record in those areas is a contrast with the approach adopted by the Opposition-something which needs to be appreciated and understood. We have seen within its `Furtive Delusions' document, otherwise known as Future Directions, the way in which it wants to take this country. The record of this Government in child care is unsurpassed in the history of this nation. The provision of affordable and quality child care is crucial to enabling women's full participation in our society. By the start of 1989 the 20,000 places promised by the Government will be fully operational, bringing the total number of Commonwealth provided child care places to 110,000, an increase of 64,000 since 1983. In the area of aged care, the focus of this Government's policy has been on the provision of residential and support services geared to people's real needs. In May 1988 further reforms to improve standards and quality of life for nursing home residents were announced: by 1991 no single resident will need to pay more than 87.5 per cent of the single age pension plus rent assistance. This Government recognises and acknowledges that with the changing demographic nature of our society, the people who will be most dependent upon these sorts of facilities at the older age limits are women. This is acknowledged within the context of the strategies that this Government is developing and in the current review of income security arrangements for retired people. Women are the major users of health services, reflecting their special health needs, their major role as carers and the higher usage of medical services among the aged. The national policy on women's health will be released shortly. In addition, $5.1m has been allocated in the three years to 1990 for breast and cervical screening services. Eleven projects in all mainland States are being put in place. The Government has allocated $11.1m to the family planning program in 1988-89. And most significantly, to address the structural inequality that women confront within the community one has to address the area of income security. Assisting women and their families out of poverty is a major priority of this Government and it is something which I will talk about in more detail in a moment. The national agenda for women is a comprehensive set of strategies devised by this Government to improve the status of Australian women. The action plans contained within the agenda highlight specific areas in which the Government intends to act within the next five years. Education is another area which needs to be understood in terms of the actions which this Government has taken to provide better educational opportunities and therefore lifelong employment opportunities and life experience opportunities for women. The completion of a full secondary education by girls in Australia has increased rapidly over the life of this Government, from 44 per cent in 1983 to 57 per cent by the end of 1987. The Government recently released the national policy for the education of girls in Australia. In employment and training, since 1983 more than 56 per cent of all new jobs have gone to women, with the proportion of women in the labour force increasing by about five percentage points and the female unemployment rate declining by two percentage points. In November 1988 the Government released the Australian women's employment strategy-a Federal, State and Territory government strategy-to reduce gender segregation in the work force, to improve conditions for workers with family responsibilities, to improve training opportunities for women as part of an industry restructuring and to promote pay equality. In Australia today there are approximately 3 million women employed, compared with 4.4 million men. Following the 1982-83 recession the Australian economy has recovered strongly. Growth in the economy has been correlated with growth in women's employment between April 1983 and August 1988. In that period employment growth was stronger for women, with 27 per cent, than for men, with 12 per cent, in both full time and part time employment. The increase in female labour force participation rates is associated with a number of social trends, including declining fertility rates, a rise in the proportion of marriages ending in divorce, and a dramatic increase in the number of single headed families. That brings me to discuss the issue of income assistance. Following the contribution from the honourable member for Flinders, it is important to understand the way he has distorted the performance of this Government in the area of family income and family support. I will refer to comments made by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in this House on 6 March when he said: It is important, when one is discussing income distribution and income transfers, to take account of social wage measures . . . for example, the impact of Medicare. If a family has children, clearly it needs health insurance. Medicare is worth about $21 a week for a family earning around average weekly earnings (AWE). In relation to superannuation, this Government, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has made superannuation widely available to ordinary families. Under the 3 per cent arrangements that is worth $14.40 a week for a family on average weekly earnings. In the area of education, we do not need to refer only to the increase in the retention rates, from 35 to 65 per cent, under this Government-nearly 30 per cent more are staying to year 12-but more precisely, an average weekly earnings family with one year 11 student and two younger children will receive about $32 a week from Austudy. So taking just those three social wage measures together and comparing them with the Institute of Family Studies alleged tax loss- which was mentioned by the honourable member for Flinders- we are talking about a gain of $67 per week or its equivalent. This matter is not acknowledged by the Opposition, but it ought to be acknowledged. I am sure it is understood and appreciated by the community generally. For the enlightenment of the Opposition I refer to an article in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald by Ross Gittins, which gives a decent and rather reasonable analysis of that position and which gives the lie to the propositions which have been put by the Opposition on this matter. Even though the majority of women over 35 years of age are either in paid work or wanting to be in paid work, the image that society holds of women is as mothers and wives rather than as workers. The family is still, and will remain, the institution around which women's identities are shaped by society. There is no argument with women choosing to see their primary role as child carers and home based. There is no dispute about the value of this work. However, I am concerned by the conservative representation of the family and the emotions which are being appealed to and the rhetoric which espouses a return to so-called family values. It is powerful ideology and it is one which has its foundation in the history of this country. But it is one which has been changing and that is not acknowledged by the Opposition, which does not seem to understand the demography of this country. I refer to an article by Peter McDonald entitled `Families in the Future-The Pursuit of Personal Autonomy', which states: There is no doubt that there have been substantial changes in the demography of the family since the early 1970s, the important aspects of which are as follows. He points out: . . in 1971, 36 per cent of 20-24 year-old women had never married compared with 64 per cent in 1986. . . There is no doubt that much higher percentages of Australians will not marry at all during their lifetimes. It is worth pointing out that the article states: . . marriage rates in 1971 imply that 99 per cent of men and 100 per cent of women would ever marry . . . The 1986 rates imply that only 63 per cent of men and 65 per cent of women will ever marry. . . The percentage of marriages ending in divorce based on annual data increased from 14 per cent in 1971 to 35 per cent in 1986. . . Among family households, there has been a growth in one-parent families and in couple families without children. These trends relate to delay of the first birth, divorce, ex-nuptial child-bearing, and the emergence of the `empty nest' life cycle stage, the stage when all the children have left home. Couples with no children present made up 31 per cent of family households in 1986 while couples with dependent children constituted 45 per cent. One-parent families were 8 per cent of all family households. I think that ought to be understood by the Opposition, because it has not addressed that in its Future Directions document. We need only to look at the imagery portrayed by that document to see that it nowhere near acknowledges the changing nature of the demography of this country or the changing nature of the aspirations of the people who live in the community. There is no denying the support that this Party and this Government have for the role of women and the family. It ought to be understood that when we are addressing policy directions for this community, not only in the area of affirmative action but in the area of child maintenance and family assistance, in the area of child care generally and in the areas of education and employment, we are adopting strategies which address the needs of the community and not ones which are hidebound by a premonition of what we believe would be a mirror of standards which may have applied in the 1930s, 1940s or 1950s. The imagery which this document portrays is one which does not gell with the majority of Australian families. It does not gell in terms of the employment figures or the way in which this country's demography is heading, the way in which women are choosing to lead different lives and the way in which this Government is providing those opportunities for women not only to remain at home, but also to enter the work force and to have educational opportunities. That approach is far different from the sort of approach which is offered by those on the Opposition benches. That is something I am sure the community generally will easily and readily understand.

He does not have much going for him in that coalition. The Leader of the Opposition chooses now to defend his mate by taking his defiance of the Chair a point further. He comes into this place asking for respect for his position. He comes into this place asking for respect for his Opposition. He requests that respect in an environment in which he turns loose his front bench to create mayhem here. Let us look at some of the statistics of that mayhem. We get a constant stream of criticism from the Opposition that this Government abuses Question Time. Opposition members claim that they are not able to get information, that they cannot get questions asked and that they are unable to convey to the House and the rest of the country via Question Time a legitimate criticism of the Government's activities.  I will just produce a few statistics on how many questions were asked in the previous Government's last three years in office and how many questions have been asked in our last three years in office. I would not have raised these matters, but the Leader of the Opposition took his censure motion into the broad areas of the conduct of Question Time, the role of this House at Question Time and whether the chamber is conforming to its functions as a result of the way in which it is chaired. In 1980 a total of 762 questions were asked. In 1981, 942 questions were asked; in 1982, 708; in 1986, 934; in 1987, 898, and in 1988, 715. So, in terms of the number of questions asked in this place, in terms of a fair crack of the whip for the Opposition in being able to criticise or quiz the Government via Question Time, in each one of our last three years more questions were asked of this Government and, therefore, more opportunities were available to the Opposition than was the case in the last three years of the previous Government. The Leader of the Opposition, in his unctuous way, suggests to you, Madam Speaker, that you have failed to hold order in this House. There are plenty of observers in the press gallery and people on both sides of the House who have served in this House longer than the period of office of this Government. There has never been an opposition which has chosen to express itself in a way in which it seeks not to debate but to create disorder in order to shut down the processes. That has never occurred before. I can remember back to 1982 because it was during my first term in Parliament. I ask honourable members to contemplate what was happening in 1982 and to compare it with the pathetic display that we get from the Opposition now, which falters in every effort it makes to mount an attack on the Government. It is faltering here today in trying to mount an attack on the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). In 1982, day after day, we were standing this on its head with censure motions that were having a major impact on public respect for the way in which the Opposition, then in government, was governing this place. In that period 62 points of order were raised in Question Time. Let us face it: the Opposition raises points of order in Question Time in order to be disruptive. Members of the Opposition can come in this place, with all the unction and mealy-mouthed nonsense that they like, clasping their hands to their chests, pointing out how good they are and wrapping themselves in the cloth of propriety. But they know darned well what the process is of taking points of order at Question Time. About 5 per cent of them are legitimate points of order. And the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) is one of the principal offenders. He has not been in this place long, but he has managed to start a reputation not for any position on policy, not for any position of advancing the interests of the people of this country, but for creating disruption in this place. He, along with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), managed to produce in the course of last year something like 144 points of order-almost treble the number of the points of order that were produced during the time we were in Opposition. He has scarcely concealed the fact that the Opposition front bench has a policy of disruption. The Opposition has a few people to do it: one is a fairly clever person in the form of the honourable member for O'Connor; and it has a couple of dullards, and I include the honourable member for Farrer, who will not make a reputation in this place by any other means. He will seek to make his reputation in this place by dissolving its good order. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this category of people who will leave this place only with a reputation for dissolving its good order.

Madam Speaker, you have found yourself confronted with a situation in which you are continually challenged by the Opposition front bench as to the dignity of your office. There has not been an occasion when the honourable member for O'Connor has come to the dispatch box to raise a point of order, and having done so and having had a ruling on it, and has not chiacked you on the way back to his seat. He does not wait until he gets back to his seat. He chiacks you on the way back. Madam Speaker, you have shown forbearance for the honourable member for O'Connor for the last couple of years with his Opposition Leader approved behaviour. At least, I suppose, that is some form of manifestation of his cleverness. He knows that on the whole you feel obliged, Madam Speaker, to permit a free flow of debate in this House and to permit a certain amount of respect for members who raise points of orders on the ground that there is some vague possibility that they might be serious about them. I think in this situation that you have found yourself to have been sorely mistaken, because rather than simply get a response that acknowledges that Opposition members have got away with something they have decided on this occasion to censure you.  There is another reason why the Opposition censures you, Madam Speaker, and why there have been so many censures. It is not because you are a bad Speaker. It is not because your Deputy is a bad Speaker. The simple fact-I am afraid to say it but it happens to be true, and it is one of the reasons why we see only one female face on the very far back benches of the Opposition-is that the Opposition hates to see women in positions of authority. Opposition members have not been able to stand your presence in this place since you have been here. I have noticed this with my deputy, the honourable member for Canberra, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly). The hatred and the venom that has been directed towards her by Opposition spokesmen since she has had that position goes beyond the normal bounds of political discourse. They are unused to seeing women in positions of authority and they cannot cop it when they see it. come in here with their Future Directions document. They adverted to it here. The Leader of the Opposition is going to run from this place. The jingle associated with it was devised by the creator of Louis the Fly. He made Louis the Fly a household name and he hopes that, like Louis the Fly, the Leader of the Opposition will become a household name. He has become a household name throughout Australia. He has become a household name as a man who is an ineffective politician, as a person who is not fit to hold a leadership position in this country. He is not fit to hold that leadership position for the way in which he seeks to exploit political issues which are best left unsaid. There is scarcely a consensus position established in this chamber on policy matters or on behaviour in the chamber which the Leader of the Opposition has not sought to abuse in defence of his own position. His own position is secure. Nobody on his front bench has the guts to challenge him. He does not act as a secure man. He acts as a totally insecure man. He acts on that in policy terms. His Future Directions, which has been flung about the place, has more to do with his leadership than it has to do with any serious policy issues. Part of that insecurity is reflected by his incapacity to sit in that seat without yapping. He sits there through Question Time-yap, yap, yap. A man who does that and who can get up subsequently and make an unctuous speech in criticism of you, abusing you, Madam Speaker-having been tolerated day after day in this chamber by yourself because you believe that you ought to extend some respect to the position of Leader of the Opposition-is intolerable. Mr Hayden never behaved like that in this place. Not ever did Mr Hayden behave as the Leader of the Opposition behaves in this place. The Leader of the Opposition comes in here and expects us to take seriously the way in which he wraps himself in a cloak of propriety. He is the person deserving of censure. He has appointed the personnel and approved the strategies to create disruption in this House. The statistics prove it. There is no question about that. The behaviour on the front bench proves that. The Opposition has created an unusual problem that no other chairman or set of chairpersons has had to confront before. It is no wonder on occasions that the Chair finds it particularly difficult to handle. But when finally the Chair or chairmen decide to defend themselves, that is precisely the cowardly moment that the honourable member chooses to attack them. The Leader of the Opposition is establishing a reputation for cowardly behaviour and he deserves no credit.

Such leasing arrangements allow Qantas to finance new aircraft at a significantly cheaper rate than would otherwise be available. This type of arrangement is commonplace within the aviation industry, and I am advised that the National Tax Administration of Japan has published very tight regulatory guidelines, with which all leases of aircraft to foreign airlines must comply. As regards the Australian tax position, I made it clear during the last debate that the Australian Taxation Office ruling, which Opposition members were concerned about, did not apply to this type of arrangement, which is tax neutral from the Australian Government's point of view. Similarly, the legislation proposed by the Treasurer to overcome `double dipping' schemes, is to be directed at schemes that operated to the detriment of the Australian revenue. As I have stated before, the Qantas arrangements are not of this nature.  I also indicated in the debate on the previous Qantas loan guarantee legislation that the appropriateness of guarantees for future Qantas aircraft is currently under review as part of the process of implementing the May 1988 reform package for Qantas.

Even today, it costs this nation $4 billion a year in tax concessions for the superannuation scheme. The Government has tried to encourage people to plan for their own retirement, to work now earning that money, but saving it. As I said, superannuation is the most direct form of saving for retirement. At the same time the Government has made a commitment in writing. It is on the record that the people shall have the right to choose a lump sum on retirement. I heard Opposition members-particularly the Nationals in my area during the election-running around saying, `Your right to get a lump sum will go'. It is nonsense. It is in fact untrue. It is a lie. It is on the record. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said it. The previous Minister said it in his superannuation policies. It has been on the record from every Government Minister.  People have the right to choose to take a lump sum. But the Government has introduced incentives to encourage people to take a mix of a lump sum and an annuity. Use of the reasonable benefit limits will achieve that. We want the right for people to have a lump sum because when they retire they want to pay off the home. They want to buy the new car. They want to take that holiday. They need the dollars in the pocket. We also do not want a situation where people blow out their $150,000 pay out or whatever it might be. At the moment the average superannuation payment across the nation is only $100,000. Compare that sum with what some high fliers in business get and people will appreciate why we have had to get tough on the reasonable benefits limit-the maximum amount people can take that is tax concessioned. At the same time the Government has worked at the bottom end. Whilst it has set a limit at the top so anything people take over that amount will face the normal tax rates-people can get tax concessions up to it-the Government has also raised the threshold where there is no tax. From 1 July no-one shall pay tax on any lump sum up to $64,500. Before 1983, people paid tax at a marginal rate on 5 per cent of the lump sum they received. Then it was changed so that people paid 15 per cent up to $50,000 and 30 per cent after that. That has now been changed so that a person can take on retirement the first $64,000 and pay no tax whatsoever. Then there are tax concessions right through to their reasonable benefit limit which is calculated based on the salary they were earning and the highest salary, which they select, they earned over three consecutive years in which they have a multiplying factor. The Government has provided incentives. It now says to people, `If you were on $30,000 a year and your multiplying factor was seven'-previously the tax concession stopped at seven times 30, being $210,000-`and if you were in a private fund before such as Australian Mutual Provident Society, National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd or some of those reputable firms, and you had invested in a private fund and your eligibility was for $210,000 but you had actually been buying a superannuation scheme worth $300,000 under the Liberal and Nationals, you lost the other $90,000. You forfeited it. It went back into the fund. This Government has now created the scheme whereby you can take the extra. You can take the other $90,000 but you pay the normal marginal tax rate on it'. This is the fair way to go. Mr Deputy Speaker, it has been this Government that raised the threshold so there is no tax on the first $54,500. It is this Government that has brought in incentives-what we call the half and half incentive-where if people take half annuity and half lump sum they can multiply not by seven times their salary but by 11.25 times their salary. That is a considerable amount of money. The other thing that is most praiseworthy of this scheme-and I have not heard a comment of praise coming from the Opposition; not just in this debate but in the past-is that it has been this Government that sorted out the problems for the spouse. Before there was a deterrent. A person would take the lump sums because he believed if he took the annuity and died then his wife missed out and his kids missed out. Now there are provisions whereby his wife takes 85 per cent of what the annuity was and if she in turn dies then a large proportion of what he would have got over a 10-year period now goes into his estate. But people do not understand that. I want to come to that point in conclusion. There is a need not just to fine tune the legislation as we are doing but also because a couple of anomalies arose out of the Budget last year. I am pleased that the new Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has addressed these by applying the law from 15 February; it is this Government that has picked up all the problems and has fine tuned them. We need to explain because the confusion out there is unbelievable. I do not mention this to get sales-I am not running a commercial-but prior to the election I wrote a book which I have entitled Security in Retirement-a New Understanding. I have already distributed 5,000 of these and now I am looking to go commercial to try to meet the demand. Why is there a demand? Because people do not understand; they do not understand the terminology; they do not understand what vesting means; they do not understand what the RBLs are; they do not understand the rules; they do not understand the multiplying factors in the formula. I know people can go to accountants and I know they can talk to the superannuation representatives, but there is a need to have a basic understanding. So I would urge the Minister, as he carries these changes through the House and finally through the Senate, to consider the production of easy to read simple English books using case by case studies so that people can understand their rights and their responsibilities. I think, in judging from what the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is now putting forward by way of amendment, that we need to go out and sell again the importance of compulsory superannuation. We need to let the people realise that they are the beneficiaries. It is not government. There are many, many advantages and we understand that. It means that there will be better retirement incomes, but it means also that this nation shall have enormous wealth, a pool of money that the nation itself can borrow from. One of our reasons we have this international debt crisis is that people have been borrowing overseas. We do not have the resources in financial terms, in dollar terms right here in this country. But the superannuation pool, by compelling workers to contribute to this scheme and having employers contribute, means billions of dollars will be available right here in this nation for economic growth. It means also that because of the changes in terms of having a unified system of superannuation there will be great labour market reform taking place, greater mobility and flexibility in working patterns. But importantly there are economic advantages for the individual and I am surprised that the Opposition would come forward today trying to break down what has certainly been the most historic change ever, the most progressive changes in superannuation. I make the final point, Mr Deputy Speaker: this is about the quality of life of the elderly and the retired, and those in the Opposition who oppose superannuation as they have been doing are opposing the quality of life of ordinary people.

They did nothing. They did nothing to face what was a tragedy for this country. I acknowledge that it has been a tragedy; there was a coincidence of interests between employers on the waterfront and unions. Both had attitudes which were obviously not entirely attuned to the interests of this country. But they built up over more than 30 years of the Opposition's time in government. And the Opposition has the hide now to say that all we have got to do is get the gun out and the situation can be rectified.  Senator Collins has had the attitude that there are problems that need rectification. He has spent countless hours talking with the employers on the waterfront, the port authorities and the trade unions. If those opposite are really interested in seeing results-and I think they probably do not want to see results-they will not be disappointed in the relatively near future in the significant further results that will be achieved. They should know already that in regard to a number of ports, changes have already been made; for example, productivity increases of very considerable amounts have been achieved in grain handling. The reason why we had a meeting of senior Ministers is that Senator Collins believed that he should share with us the difficulties that he was encountering and to get our view as to what may be the appropriate course to try to accelerate the rate of reform. Out of those discussions, which will be followed up, I believe that during this year Australia will see very significant improvements on the waterfront-something achievable only under this Government. The record of the Opposition should lead it to be silent on this matter and leave to those with competence the very difficult task of improving the performance of the Australian waterfront. It is something that needs to be done. It was not done in all that time in which the previous government was in office. It can only be achieved, as it will be, under this Labor Government.

The national information and awareness program shows the small business community how to find information.  It is necessary to address who is in contact with the small business community. As I said in the last debate, for those running a small business, three people are fundamental to the effectiveness of small business: the bank manager, the accountant and the lawyer. When the Bureau of Industry Economics did a survey asking small business proprietors whether they were ever told that small business help was available from their bank manager, only 60 per cent responded positively. When asked whether they knew where that information could be obtained, only one per cent responded positively. So we have the fundamental problem that the information and services available through the States are not reaching people in need.

This issue was reactivated today in Question Time following a question that was asked of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) relating to comments by the newly appointed Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Tony Cole. He made it very clear, and again I use the comments of the Treasurer, that it is nonsense to suggest that a consumption tax would have a significant impact on net savings in Australia. For some months the issue of the consumption tax has irregularly raised its ugly head. Opposition members have floated the issue, run with the issue, developed the issue, and then hidden the issue.  I suggest that Mr Tony Cole's comment today is another nail in the economic policy coffin of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia because the whole central point of what the Liberals and Nationals have been saying is that a consumption tax, firstly, will significantly increase savings in this country and, secondly, will reduce the tax on exports and thus have a very positive impact on the quantity and, in turn, the quality of products that we sell overseas, thereby obviously having a major influence on the imbalance of trade that has existed and can exist. Mr Tony Cole is saying that the consumption tax will not be the panacea that the Liberals and Nationals have been looking for; it will not be the panacea to every economic problem besetting our nation. I note that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has never gone to any lengths to explain his full proposal. He distinguishes himself quite negatively from previous leaders of the Opposition, for at least they enunciated and explained their policies so that the people of Australia could see the alternatives. But in this instance, we see that it is part of a strategy. It seems to be a part of the Opposition strategy of what one might call perception building-an attempt to create in the minds of the community a belief that in some way it has the answer. It reminds me very much of the Bjelke-Petersen era in Queensland when Premier Bjelke-Petersen constantly used the phrase, `Don't you worry about that'. In one way it was a reasonable philosophy and a very effective mechanism for settling people down-to leave it to the Government.

One way that this can be done is by slashing government outlays. Where the Government has tried to cut down on a million dollars here or there, Opposition members have opposed it. I would suggest that, in light of their efforts in this House, we will not see much action there.  The fact is that, if we look at the mathematics of this whole proposal, their system does not work. Their system will mean a greater burden on low income earners; it will mean a slashing of the higher income tax levels to the detriment of those people who are in a lesser position to afford such a burden. It would mean an inflation rate in the first year of almost 14 per cent because it would mean an increase in the consumer price index, of the cost of living, by 7 per cent. Ultimately, it would mean resultant wage pressures. It would mean further rises in the cost of goods because that would no doubt be passed on by those in the retailing sector. There is much evidence to show that a consumption tax does not even generate the additional revenue, savings and advantages that the Liberals and Nationals are saying that it does. The final point is that it is dearer to collect. The cost of collecting the present wholesale tax is about 40c in the dollar. As I said, the number of players is only 75,000.

Opposition members cannot say, as they come into the debate in this place, that they will, by all the reforms they wish to implement, produce an increase in productivity in this country, when the increase in productivity that they foreshadow in their own Fightback! document is less than that which has been achieved by the Government over the last nine years.","N/A","PRIME MINISTER","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A","N/A"

How can Opposition members then live with the fact that in their Fightback package, on their most optimistic scenario, the foreign debt rises to $245 billion?  What we have is a Leader of the Opposition injected with a gramophone record, because the speech that he made here today, give or take the opening two or three minutes of abuse of the ABC and the Four Corners program, was the speech he made last Thursday night; it was the speech that he has made on every occasion since the Opposition brought down its Fightback package. It is simply a taxonomy of urging on the Government, `You are not doing micro-economic reform; you are not doing what you should do on the waterfront; you are not doing what you should do in the labour market; you are not doing what you should do on telecommunications; you are not doing what you should do for the jobless'. He thinks that by constant repetition of this sort of statement, without recourse either to the evidence that we produce in support of our policies or even to the evidence that he has produced to back up his policies, he can make those policies stand without being tested against his own words. The Leader of the Opposition is prepared to contemplate a very high level of unemployment on a virtually permanent basis. That is his position. Remember when that Fightback! document came down? It was an absolute guarantee to all the folk out thereâtwo million new jobs over the next nine years. An absolute guarantee. We now get statements from the Leader of the Opposition that that two million is, as the Prime Minister said, gradually slip sliding away. His two million is an indicative figureâ`We will aim towards those two million jobs'.  When the Opposition comes down with its analysis of our package, the one piece of its analysis of our packageâand we do not necessarily agree with that analysis of our package at allâthat is suppressed is what we have estimated as 800,000 jobs over the next three years and the Opposition estimates at over 900,000. That does not actually get a run, does it? That actually gets suppressed. These absolute paragons of integrity have decided that that is one feature of their analysis of our proposition that they ought not to run, because to concede that point to usâthe central issue of todayâwould be to concede that they have no argument with us in the next election campaign.

I am sick of sitting here and listening to this because I wait all the time for his evidence. We get assertion; we get no evidence. We hear, `The Government has not done what it ought to do. The railways are all terribly inefficient'. Opposition members are not aware, of course, that the expenditure in the national rail freight program is dependent on work practice efficiencies and those work practice efficiencies are being negotiated with the relevant unions.  As to the waterfront, the Prime Minister somewhat undersold himself. He said that the productivity efficiencies on the waterfront were around 50 per cent. It is true, as he says, that by the end of this year there will be a 50 per cent reduction in the work force, but the productivity rates of improvement are 60 per cent and upwards, so a much higher rate of productivity is being achieved on the waterfront. The Leader of the Opposition claimed, for example, that there had been a massive increase in idle time since these reforms had been allegedly put in place. Last year the cost of idle time fell by 80 per cent. Idle time levies were abolished at the end of last year with the move to full enterprise employment in major ports. He has not even bothered to look at what has been put in place in the waterfront; he has not bothered to look at what has been put in place as far as our railway systems are concerned. Others normally associated with the political persuasion of the Leader of the Opposition have done so. Let me quote the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce last month. These are people who actually keep up to date as far as waterfront reform is concerned.

If Opposition members bothered to read their own document, they would see that a group of them just vaporiseâthey disappear out of the system. Unemployed people, therefore, would no longer have that support. The way the Opposition has planned in this document to cut real training opportunities will devastate the training programs which are essential not just for now but so that as this economy recovers we do not find the kinds of blocks and jams that we have had in the past.  As has been pointed out constantly, the families who spend most of their income on daily living costs would be worse off.

I think it is beginning to sink in for Opposition members that, essentially, a GST is inherently regressive because the lower income earners pay a much higher proportion of their income in tax than the wealthy. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out, the Opposition, unlike a number of other countries, has refused to exempt food from the GST, while it has exempted travel packages for overseas trips. At some time the Opposition will have to explain to people why, unlike many countries overseas, it has not exempted food from the GST but somehow has exempted overseas travel packages.  will have to face up to the Treasury analysisâand neither of the two Opposition speakers today has tackled the essential revelations in that documentâand explain in their own constituencies why this analysis shows that average losses in the bottom two deciles, the bottom parts of the full time wage and salary earners, are between $10 and $18 per week, whereas the average gain in the top decile, the top 10 per cent, is between $27 and $82 per week. The document that Treasury has presented, because it is a very objective document, points out that pensioners will, on average, get small gains, but many of them will lose because of higher than average expenditure on food, clothing and footwear. Some of those detailed analyses are particularly important because we need to look at the consumption packages of particular individuals as well as the more general averages. Moreover, the analysis that we have accepted, because it is in the Opposition document, is that all retailers will automatically lower their prices by the cuts in wholesale tax. The evidence from many overseas countries that have introduced a GST and offset it with wholesale taxes is that the opportunities are taken to keep prices up. The Opposition has a degree of confidence that retailers will not take the opportunity to increase their profits and blame it on the GST. The Opposition is introducing changes, and we are accepting that retailers and wholesalers will not take advantage of the changes that are taking place, but it will be very difficult for people in the community to believe that that will not take place.  We have not in our documentânor has the Opposition in its documentâcovered the flow-on effects of first level inflation. As the Treasurer pointed out, perhaps all that we have talked about is undermined completely by the fact that there is a massive holeâa $4 billion deficit. Opposition members talk to me about how they will compensate the poor and the pensioners, yet they cannot compensate them on the present package, because of that $4 billion deficit, which comes from the mistakes in the Opposition's revenue calculations and, more importantly, the mistakes on the expenditure.  In my own field, the Opposition has plundered the social welfare budget for $2 billion. An examination of that shows that the budget is reduced by $1.1 billion. When we go through each of those proposals the Opposition makes to save $2 billion, we find in the end that there is about $1 billion. That is because the Opposition has made three major mistakes in its calculations. I do not want to go into them all in detail. The Opposition admits to the administrative costs of its proposals. For example, to put people onto special benefits after nine months on JSA is an extraordinarily expensive operation. The Opposition has not allowed for the displacement effects anywhere near the level required. When people get jobs, they often take someone else's job and that person goes onto a social security payment. The Opposition almost entirely forgets the displacement effects. The Opposition assumes that when people have their benefit chopped off, they will vanish into thin air. The truth is that most people whose benefits are cut off often will move onto a lesser benefit and get less money. The Opposition has not allowed for that. As I said before, in the Opposition document some of the unemployed simply vaporised.

If, by reason of a continued equality of votes, the special ballot is inconclusive, then, unless a name is withdrawn, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes. When the sitting is resumed, the votes shall be taken again unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. At any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of any subsequent ballot, a Member whose name was submitted in the first ballot may withdraw his or her name and all further proceedings shall take place as if a motion for the appointment of the Member as a Deputy Speaker had not been moved.

If the offices of Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker become vacant at the same time the House shall appoint 2 Members to be Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker in the same manner as set out in standing order 13. Single vacancy in office of Deputy Speaker or Second Deputy Speaker 22B. When a single vacancy occurs in the office of Deputy Speaker or the office of Second Deputy Speaker the House shall appoint a Member to fill the vacant office in the following manner: A motion shall be moved, without notice, that a Member be appointed Deputy Speaker or Second Deputy Speaker, as the case may be, of this House, which motion shall be seconded. In the case of appointment to the office of Second Deputy Speaker, only a non-government Member may be named in the motion. The Speaker shall then ask if there is any further motion, and if there is not, shall say that the time for motions has expired. No Member may then address the House or move any motion for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office, and the Speaker shall, without question put, declare the Member named in the motion, to have been appointed to the vacant office. If more than one motion for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office is moved and seconded, the Speaker shall, after the second motion, and after each subsequent motion (if any), ask if there is any further motion, and if there is not, shall say that the time for motions has expired. When the time for motions has expired, debate may ensue, but it shall be relevant to the election. No Member may speak for more than 5 minutes. At any time during the debate, a motion without notice may be moved by a Minister rising in his or her place, and whether any Member is addressing the Chair or not, 'That the question be now put', which question shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. Upon the carrying of the question 'That the question be now put', or upon the cessation of the debate otherwise, the appointment of the Member to fill the vacant office shall be proceeded with as provided in this standing order. Before the House proceeds to a ballot the bells shall be rung as in a division. When only 2 motions for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office are moved and seconded, each Member, other than the Speaker, shall deliver to the Clerk a ballot paper in writing, containing the name of the Member named in one or other of the motions for whom he or she votes, and the votes shall be counted by the Clerks at the Table; and the Member who has the greater number of votes shall be appointed to the vacant office. When more than 2 motions for the appointment of a Member to the vacant office are moved and seconded, the votes shall be taken in the same manner, and the Member who has the greatest number of votes shall be appointed to the vacant office, provided he or she has also a majority of the votes of the Members present; but if no Member has such majority, the name of the Member having the smallest number of votes shall be excluded from subsequent ballots, and a fresh ballot shall take place; and this shall be done as often as necessary until one Member has such majority when he or she shall be appointed to the vacant office. If, after any ballot, other than a ballot which takes place in accordance with paragraph ( k ) of this standing order, in which the names of only 2 Members are submitted, there is an equality of votes, the Speaker shall give a casting vote and the Member for whom he or she votes shall be appointed to the vacant office. If, after any ballot in which the names of more than 2 Members are submitted, it is impossible by reason of an equality of votes to determine which name shall be excluded from subsequent ballotsâ If there is an equality of votes for 2 Members, the Speaker shall give a casting vote and the name of the Member for whom he or she does not vote shall be excluded from subsequent ballots; and If there is an equality of votes for more than 2 Members, a special ballot shall take place at which there shall be submitted only the names of those Members who have received equal votes and in which each Member shall write on the ballot paper only the names of the Members he or she wishes to retain. The name of the Member who receives the smallest number of votes shall be excluded from subsequent ballots. If, by reason of a continued equality of votes, the special ballot is inconclusive, then, unless a name is withdrawn, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes. When the sitting is resumed, the votes shall be taken again unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. At any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of any subsequent ballot, a Member whose name was submitted in the first ballot may withdraw his or her name and all further proceedings shall take place as if a motion for the appointment of the Member had not been moved. Whenever a withdrawal leaves only one Member in respect of whom a motion for appointment to the vacant office is before the House, that Member shall be declared to have been appointed. Standing order 28B (general purpose standing committees): At the end of paragraph ( c ) add: 'Provided further that, for the purpose of consideration of a bill referred to a committee pursuant to standing order 217A, one or more members of the committee may be replaced by other Members nominated in accordance with the provisions set out in this paragraph.
