"That may be so. My friend the honorable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates) interjected while I was speaking last night something about Barwells legacy. I wish to return for a moment to that subject. No doubt Sir Henry Barwell was extravagant in his administration of South Australian affairs, but he did a tremendous amount of good work.","17"
"And I repeat that such statements coming from the honorable member are contemptible.","17"
"It has been hinted that this debate must be concluded to-day. Had the Prime Minister responded to the call of humanity we could have ended the discussion in about two hours. The work people of Australia have declared in no uncertain'way, ' We want work ' ; but the Prime Minister has shown a callous disregard of their urgent need, the like of which I did not think he was capable. He has treated the motion altogether too lightly. There are in Australia to-day at least 100,000 work persons out of employment.","17"
"Many hundreds of dispirited, gaunt-faced men daily tramp the streets of Newcastle looking for the jobs that do not materialize. In their homes or what is left of what were once reasonably comfortable dwellings - for the best part of the furniture, in many cases, has found its way to the second-hand shops - pale-faced, anxious wives and children nightly await the return of ' father.' There is little need to frame the query, ' How did you get on to-day?' The answer is already revealed in the listless eyes and the grim tightening of the lips. On the faces of the women and children the ravages of semi-starvation are plainly apparent.","11"
"In view of the economic conditions ruling at the commencement of the present year it was necessary for a reconsideration of the volume of immigration, and it was decided that during the forthcoming winter the number of assisted migrants should be reduced to a minimum.","11","12"
"Action on these lines has been taken on two occasions since the beginning of this year in order to relieve the present situation in New Zealand. In speeches from a public platform and in Parliament, the Prime Minister of the Dominion has stated that his Government is doing its best to improve the economic condition of the people. It has, as I have stated, taken steps to prevent migrants from entering New Zealand whilst the present economic depression continues. Even Mr. Amery, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, who recently visited Australia, returned to Great Britain with opinions somewhat modified as to the ability of this country to absorb migrants. In speeches delivered since his return to the Mother Country, he has stated that the transfer of British people to Australia is not by any means an easy matter, and that great care must be exercised to ensure that those who come to Australia shall be profitably employed. The honorable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) and other Ministerial supporters, appear to endorse the view of the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Government has no authority to prevent the influx of foreign migrants. I challenge that contention most emphatically. When dealing with this subject last year, I quoted section 3k of the Immigration Restriction Act, which reserves to the Governor-General in Council complete authority to restrict migration if the economic conditions existing in the Commonwealth warrant such a course. The Government of New Zealand is acting under a similar authority. It is generally admitted that economic conditions in Australia at the moment are most unsatisfactory. I say, therefore, that it is competent for the Government to take the necessary steps to restrict migration and so relieve the present depression. I have nothing to say personally against immigrants from European countries. Some of them are my personal friends. My contention is that since the economic position of the Commonwealth is not satisfactory, we should restrict migration, and be particularly careful not to allow an influx of migrants whose standards of living are lower than our own.","11","12","17"
"I would have no hesitation whatever in enforcing that policy whenever the economic position of Australia justified that course, and I would have no fear of international complications, because such action would be in the interests of prospective migrants. The Prime Minister knows that the Government is vested with the necessary authority, and yet he excuses the inaction of his Government by endeavouring to persuade honorable members that any restrictive action might result in grave international complications. I have in my possession a translation of a speech made by Signor Mussolini, the Prime Minister of Italy, dealing with the migration of Italian nationals to foreign countries. I may add that I obtained this translation from the Foreign Affairs branch of the Prime Ministers Department, so that the right honorable gentleman must know the views of the government of Italy on this important subject. Mussolini declares that if Italy is to have any voice in international affairs in the future she must enter the next half of this century with a population of 60,000,000. The Prime Minister has declared that the migration of Southern Europeans would not seriously affect the economic position of Australia. Official figures show, however, that in the three years, 1924-27, the excess of arrivals over departures of Europeans was 26,000, mainly from Southern Europe. On this basis we may assume that during the last five years we have added at least 40,000 people from southern European countries to the population of Australia. Can it be argued that the presence of 40,000 migrants from the other side of the world, people whose standard of living is below our own, will not have some influence on the Australian labour market?","17"
"I am instructed by the -union to write you and bring under your notice a matter of importations of cooperage. Resch's Brewery, Sydney, have imported 750 casks from Germany. These casks will be used as containers for distribution of beer in Sydney. At the same time there are many coopers unemployed in Sydney who could quite well make these casks. There are unemployed coopers in the other States as well, and plants available to do this work in all States.","11"
"If I were a beer drinker in Sydney I should not drink one drop of Resch's beer from German casks. Resch's Limited, although it has a German name, is an Australian firm, and it should work under Australian conditions. I contend that the tariff should be so amended to bring about additional employment. I do not say that the Government can provide reproductive work for everybody, but it can by legislation upon certain lines, provide employment, notwithstanding the waitings of the honorable member for Perth (Mr. Mann), and the jeremiads of the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster), who I am surprised to find is drifting into the freetrade camp. At onetime he was the champion of Australian industry. Every member of this Parliament should he vitally concerned for the employment of our people. Unemployment is rife although summer is here. Our harvest has been better and our wool prices higher than we anticipated. Things are not so gloomy as we expected, but we are approaching the bitterly cold winter months, when women and children will not have sufficient blankets to cover them nor sufficient garments to clothe them. Many of our men, women and children will suffer severely during the winter. The prospect is appalling. Let us, as true Australians, endeavour to give some relief to suffering humanity. The dole system is a curse to any country. Sometimes I think that in a place like Australia we should be ashamed to talk even about unemployment insurance except in certain cases. There should be work for all and we should be poor, puny Australians if we did not attempt to give some relief to the unemployed.","11","12","17"
"All unions are keenly anxious for a 44-hour week, but it is another thing to be able to get it. Forty-eight hours with a job is better than 44 without one. This is the real stumbling block in many of these cases for a shorter week. To grant it would mean the loss of their jobs. The workmen of the community cannot afford it. There is not enough money being made. If hours were got down to 404, a lot of men would starve. When we get down to the question of where the border line exists I have come to the conclusion that if the great majority of workers were to say: ' We will not work more than 44 hours, ' they would pinch their bellies. That is getting down to homely language. I am not troubling about the employers so much. The 44-hour week for every one would never do. It may be that in twenty years time the country generally, will have so increased productiveness as to make a general reduction feasible.","11"
"Eight or nine months ago he said -","11"
"I am willing to help you to get a 44-hour week, but you can only get it if you produce in 44 hours as much as you now produce in 48 hours.","11"
"Honorable members are acquainted with the views of Mr. Chapman on the question of piece-work; but for their benefit I shall read again what he has said -","11","12"
"The Council of the Australian Railways Union . . . has affirmed more drastically than ever that any member of the Australian Railways Union who accepts the bonus for butty gang, piece-work, and similar pernicious systems, will be disciplined even to the point of expulsion.","11"
"If these men admit the correctness of the Chief Judge's view they are to be expelled from the union! Has any member of the Opposition questioned that attitude? No; they have all taken it lying down. Every one knows that it is impossible to make any progress except along the lines suggested by ' the Chief Judge. What can be said of men who claim to be the leaders of the workers and yet sit idly by while Arbitration awards are being defied even by employees in Government workshops? It cannot be argued that the employers, who in this instance are the people themselves, have any desire to cut down the wages of the men. During the last few weeks the boilermakers at Walsh Island dockyard threw the whole of the works idle because of a proposal to introduce piece-work, which is contrary to the rules of their union. That is a State Government undertaking. The Minister for Works in New South Wales has been obliged to consider the advisability of disposing of the undertaking to a private concern as a result of the current trouble. 'When the Federal Arbitration Court conceded a 44-hour week to the engineering trades it attached to the award what was understood to be a condition that piece-work should be introduced in order to assist the industry to improve production and meet enhanced costs. Walsh Island recently undertook a big contract for the construction of six steel cars a week for the State Railways Department. The management was unable to keep pace with the work and therefore called for more union workers. Great difficulty was experienced in obtaining those additional workers; consequently the management offered a bonus on the piecework system. The boilermakers' organization asked the management to abolish the system in three days, and said that in the event of its failure to do so they would have to call the men out of the workshops. The threat has been made that if the work in question is transferred to the Sydney workshops other unions will be involved. It will he seen that the men are disobeying what Chief Judge Dethridge laid down as a condition precedent to a 44-hour week. They not only will not allow their own men to work, but they threaten to force others out of employment. Yet not a Labour leader has the courage to say that this policy, which leads to the sending of work outside Australia, is one of the most potent causes of unemployment, and that it is time a definite stand was taken in regard to it. The New South Wales Railway Commissioners decided on the construction of steel cars mainly as a result of the lessons that were taught by a number of disastrous collisions, ' which showed that wooden cars telescoped easily and caused casualties, a result which could be partially eliminated by the use of steel cars. The conversion of the present stock of wood cars to steel cars has been delayed by the strike, thus increasing the danger to the travelling public in New South Wales. Not merely is employment being interfered with, but the lives, the health and the welfare of travellers are jeopardized because these men will not accept conditions that are generally recognized to be necessary to industry. The Labour delegates who accompanied the industrial mission which visited the United States of America advocated on their return a system of payment by results. Yet the unions will not agree to it, and the leaders of the Labour party dare not raise a voice in protest.","11","17"

"Before the luncheon adjournment I dealt with the failure of the official leaders of Labour to do their duty to the workers of Australia by showing them clearly that the only practicable means whereby a permanent improvement in their conditions, particularly in regard to hours, can be achieved is by increase'd production. What is true of the question of hours is equally true with regard to strikes. Since we have compulsory arbitration, both Federal and State, a strike is surely an anachronism. Compulsory arbitration surely means that the two parties to a dispute place their case before an impartial tribunal, which determines the issue, and the finding or award of that impartial tribunal should be accepted without quibble and be binding on both parties. But we find that, despite this system of compulsory arbitration, there is a continual series of strikes.","20"
"The figures afforded a definite comparison in the only manner in which a comparison could be made. The Prime Minister set out the position in a straightforward manner, and it is unworthy of honorable members opposite to attribute ulterior motives to the right honorable gentleman. During the last five 'years the loss in wages to Australia, as a result of strikes, was no less' than £7,500,000. The indirect loss was a great deal more than that. The honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore) quoted figures to indicate what 100,000 men out of work meant. My figures show the actual result of strikes which would not have occurred had the leaders of the Labour movement said boldly that they were opposed to anything of the kind. If in their opinion the awards of the arbitration tribunals should not be obeyed, they should say at once, ' Let the arbitration system be scrapped.' Honorable members opposite, however, are too prone to advise their supporters to accept any award that is favorable to them, and to decline anything that is unfavorable.  I propose to quote some figures relating to the coal industry to illustrate the effect of strikes. The coal industry in Australia has a special tribunal to settle all its disputes, a body specially appointed by this Parliament. During the last five years, however, the loss in wages due to strikes in the industry amounted to £5,500,000. The continual set-backs to the coal industry, due to interruption by strikes, have caused a stupendous loss to Australia. They have increased the cost of coal to such an extent that, gradually, the export trade of Australia is being lost. In 1921 we exported 2,771,000 tons of coal, whereas last year we exported only 675,000 tons.","17"
"I rise to a point of order. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) has repeated a statement which the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore) said was untrue. I submit that the Treasurer should accept the word of the honorable member for Dalley.","17"
"Order! The Treasurer made a statement in connexion with certain matters of finance. The honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore) interjected that the statement was untrue, and that the Treasurer knew that it was untrue. Such a remark is distinctly out of order.","17"

"It is obvious that the Government is in sore straits, otherwise it would not attempt to apply the 'gag' when a motion of censure is before the House. Honorable members who have not yet spoken to the motion, but desire to do so, will now be prevented from speaking, notwithstanding that they have gone to some trouble to collect data to place before honorable members. Realizing that honorable members on this side have presented facts to the House, and that further facts are in the possession of honorable members who have not yet spoken, the Government is endeavouring to suppress them by applying the ' gag.' Honorable members on the other side have evaded the real issue ; they have consistently refrained from offering any suggestion to alleviate the distress caused by unemployment in Australia. At the last moment the Treasurer has risen in an effort to divert attention from the real issue by raising the question of arbitration. Seeing that the Government is supported by free traders, foreign importers, ex-strikers, and ' shandy-gaff ' protectionists, it is useless to expect from it a policy which will advance Australia's interests. Following the Prime Minister's callous references to the unemployed, honorable members behind him slandered the workers of Australia, thus injuring Australia in the eyes of other nations. Last of all we have the Treasurer attempting to deliver a lecture on the duties of Australian industrialists, and advocating piece-work. I wish the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Hill) was present to hear what I am about to say regarding piece-work in the department under his control. The construction of a railway in the far north was recently commenced. As a result of a vote of workmen it was decided to adopt the principle of piece-work. They entered into an agreement with the department for the construction of certain earthworks. Expenditure 1 amounting, in some instances, to as much as £300 dr £500, was incurred in the purchase of the necessary plant; but as soon as the Government found itself in financial difficulties, the Minister repudiated the whole of those contracts. It is easy enough for Ministers to preach doctrines in which they do not believe; but they find it difficult to put them into practice. Apparently, what is a vice in the workers is a virtue in members of the Government. If that is to be the spirit in which the Government will meet the workers at the suggested peace conference, all I can say is, ' God help the workers.' The Government appears to take a delight in injuring the workers on every possible occasion. Recently it amended the Navigation Act, making it no longer necessary for competent seamen and officers to be employed on vessels of under 50 tons weight. In the most dangerous waters of Australia the only safeguard to the lives of travellers was removed. In its desire to obtain sweated native labour at 3s. a week, the Government dispensed with the services of certificated masters. Yet it asks the industrialists of Australia to attend a peace conference. What can be expected from a government which on every possible occasion stabs the workers in the hack? The whole of the defence offered by honorable members opposite has been hyprocritical. The Treasurer has spoken about finance. Was there ever a more hopeless bungle than we have at present with the Treasurer not only unable to forecast his revenue but also quite unable to approximate his expenditure to his revenue? Parliament has passed bills authorizing the construction of urgent railways and other works, and provision has been made in loan bills for the cost of these works, but the Treasurer,' unable to approximate his expenditure to his estimated revenue, cannot find the money for them. The works thus suspended would have employed thousands of men not in localities where migrants would have congregated but in portions of Australia requiring development. If carried out they would have 'increased Australia's production, and thus have provided more avenues for employment. But the bungling methods of the Treasurer have tied them up.  I have information in my possession that would give the lie to the deliberate misquotations of honorable members on the Ministerial side of the chamber. The fact remains that there are 100,000 men unemployed in Australia to-day, and when we realize how many persons are dependent on those who are out of work, the present state of affairs is appallingly tragic. Yet the Prime Minister declares that it is not the concern of the Commonwealth Government. If I had the time I could make that argument look ridiculous and so with all the other arguments used by the right honorable gentleman in dealing with this motion. I could show that lack of administrative ability and the refusal to provide adequate protection for our secondary industries, and adequate means - transport and other - for the promotion of primary industries, are the direct cause of the existing unemployment. I know that the motion will not be carried, and that the gag awaits those who want to speak to it; but it will go down in history that the Bruce-Page Ministry was the most callous that ever controlled the Commonwealth.","17"
"No, but if I were depending on a job for my livelihood and the harder I worked the sooner I would bring it to an end, and if there was nothing in sight for me to do afterwards, self-preservation would compel me to make the job last as long as possible. When we get to the bread and butter side of the question we must admit that that is the position. I have not yet got to the sob stuff about which the honorable member for Gwydir (Mr. Abbott) was so pleased to talk.","17"
