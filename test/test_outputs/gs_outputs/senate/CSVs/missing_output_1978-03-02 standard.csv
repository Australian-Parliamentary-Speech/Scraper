"2U4","I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I seek leave to have the text of the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The speech read as follows- The main purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative framework within which the Commonwealth will be enabled to make agreements with the States on financial assistance for water resource projects. Projects selected under the Government's $200m national water resources program will be authorised by such agreements. It has been the practice for assistance to the States to be authorised by specific purpose Acts. However, the Government is of the view that standing legislation of this nature is more appropriate to the requirements of a long-term program. Moreover, it will reduce the legislative load in the Parliament without in any way restricting the flow of information or reducing the opportunities for debate. A copy of every agreement with a State must be tabled in the Parliament. In addition, the Parliament will need to consider separately the appropriation of funds for the purpose of the agreements. Turning to the provisions of the Bill, section 3 defines the range of projects for which assistance will be available to the States. It encompasses all aspects of water resources management for which Commonwealth assistance would be appropriate- conservation and distribution works, water quality management, desalinisation of agricultural land, flood mitigation and floodplain management, and studies or investigations relating to all aspects of the assessment and utilisation of Australia 's water resources. Section 7 includes an appropriation in this financial year out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of $2. 5m to meet existing commitments to the States for the following water resource development projects: $lm to New South Wales for flood mitigation works on the coastal rivers and $1.5m to Queensland to enable completion of the Gin Gin channel in the Bundaberg irrigation project. I should point out that the Commonwealth has provided $17m since 1964-65 in grant funds to New South Wales for flood mitigation works on its coastal rivers, generally on a 2:2:1 funding basis- Commonwealth, State and local government authorities respectively. The Commonwealth has always accepted a contingent commitment in respect of flooding disasters, and this particular program has without any doubt considerably reduced the destructive effects of these recurrent natural hazards. It has also contributed significantly to the security of life in flood-prone areas. The Commonwealth first became involved with Queensland in the Bundaberg irrigation project in 1970 with the provision of a grant of $12. 8m for Monduran Dam, Gin Gin channel and the main pumping station linking the dam through Gin Gin channel to the Burnett River. A further grant of $4.4m was provided in 1 974 to cover cost increases for these works. The current grant, on a dollar for dollar basis with the State, will enable the works with which the Commonwealth has been associated to be completed in this financial year and will enable the water now stored in Monduran Dam to be utilised more effectively. The administrative arrangements for implementing the national water resources program have been established and the States have been invited to submit their priorities for Commonwealth assistance under the program. The Bill before the Senate is a step in this process, and the continuing nature of the proposed Act lends itself eminently to sustained initiatives by the Commonwealth to ensure the most effective development and utilisation of Australia's water resources. I commend the Bill to the Senate. Debate (on motion by Senator Georges) adjourned."
"8G4","As Senator Missen has indicated, my attention has only just been drawn to the comments of Mr Waight. I have had a quick look through them. Some are fairly technical. And I do not know whether I would accept his interpretation of proposed new section 7Q. To me, it seems to provide a pretty wide discretion embracing the discretion that a court would have in criminal proceedings to reject evidence of whatever character. However, I will have that matter looked at and give it further consideration. As I have said throughout the Committee stage, this is not necessarily the end of any matter raised. The Bill is to be debated in the other place before it is finalised. If necessary, it can come back to this chamber. I adopt the same attitude on these matters as I did on others. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment; report adopted."
"KTZ","Nonsense. Mr Acting Deputy President, with the concurrence of the Minister, I seek leave to have the table incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read as follows- N.B.- excludes workers' compensation insurance in coal industry. The percentage increases in value of claims from 1 973-74, 1 975-76 were (in order): N.B.- Victoria and New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory main competitors for South Australian manufacturing firms. The Australian increase was 63.3 per cent, that is South Australia was third best and better than the Australian average. N.B.- excludes workers' compensation insurance in coal industry. The percentage increases in value of premiums from 1973-74 to 1975-76 were (in order): The Australian increase was 150.1 per cent, that is, South Australia was third best and well below the Australian average. Claims and Premiums per Worker I have attempted to calculate a per worker figure since the statistics do not record how many are covered nor do they allow comparisons of rates in each State by occupation. Because of the uncertainty of who is insured, I calculated the numbers in each State in May, 1976, who were: (a) in the labour force, (b) civilian employee, and removed from these the number employed in coal mining. In both cases, South Australia was third lowest and 22 per cent below the Australian average. In both cases again, South Australia was third lowest and 25 per cent below the Australian average. I think that I have rebutted all of the arguments put by Senator Messner when he tried to build up a case in relation to South Australia. No doubt his colleagues will quote his words, but when they read my speech they might think better of it. Senator Young's speech was based on two points. The first was the usual backslapping in acclaiming the Governor-General's Speech. As I said earlier, it was a well-delivered speech but it was not written by the Governor-General. Two of the most important matters on which Senator Young dwelt were the election results in South Australia, and he made a very interesting comment on that subject, and the question of uranium, about which he misquoted several things. Even though he quoted from the South Australian Hansard, a completely different picture emerges when one reads it properly, and I might refer to that later. I invite Senator Messner to get hold of a copy of a document printed in South Australia entitled South Australian Development 1977' to see how the State is progressing and what we are doing there. Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland, for years has been putting out documents like this to prove to the people what his State is doing. On the very first occasion that the South Australian Government does a similar thing to acquaint the people with the facts Liberal members ask questions without notice or put questions on notice about how much the publication costs, how much people were paid to do the photography and how many people were on the free list. They have tried to stifle information being made available to the general public in South Australia on how the State is developing at a rapid rate under the Dunstan Labor Government. I deal now with what Senator Young had to say on the election results. On page 173 of the Senate Hansard of 28 February he is recorded as saying that he was going to indulge in a wee spot of parochialism. He continued:"
"KTZ","No, it was in 1953, under the Playford Government. In March 1956 we find that the Labor Party obtained 47.37 per cent of the vote and the Liberal Party 36.69, the latter again forming the Government. In 1959 the figures were 49.35 per cent for the Labor Party and 36.95 per cent for the Liberal Party, which again formed a government. In March 1962 the Labor Party obtained 53.97 per cent of the vote, nearly 20 per cent more than the 34.5 1 per cent obtained by the Liberal Party, yet we still could not form a government. Going on to 1965, we find that we had to obtain 55.04 per cent of the vote to win government in that State. That is the way in which the gerrymander worked, yet the Senator Youngs were completely silent. Turning to 1968, under Steele Hall's leadership, the figures were 51.98 per cent for the Labor Party and 43.82 per cent for the Liberal Party. The latter formed a government, although we obtained 9 per cent more of the vote. Going on to 1970, we find that Labor obtained 52.14 per cent of the vote. That was the first time since 1965 that the Liberals, though not having a majority of the vote, failed to form a government. From then on, we formed a government in 1970. In 1973 we obtained 5 1.52 percent and the Liberals 39.79. In 1975 we obtained 46.32 per cent and the Liberals obtained 31.53 per cent. In September of last year, that great year when Mr Tonkin challenged Mr Dunstan to go to the people and take account of himself, the result was 5 1.64 per cent for the Labor Party and 4 1 .2 1 per cent for the Liberal Party- again a 10 per cent majority, but this time we won government. We find hononourable senators coming into this place and criticising the last Senate election figures. They are saying that because they got so close in the overall figure for South Australia at the last election they were robbed of one seat in particular- yet nothing was said in all those years about the times when the Labor Party had a massive majority but could not form a government. I seek leave to incorporate that document in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read as follows- I also seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the statement by Mr Dunstan on industrial relations to which I meant to refer earlier, and concerning which Senator Messner made such great play. He quoted the statement that Mr Dunstan had made in Victoria a week or two ago. Leave granted. The document read as follows-"
"DV4","by leave- On behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) I present a speech he made in the other place about three hours ago. I think all honourable senators have read it. I seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read as follows- On 14th July 1977, Sir John Kerr announced his intention to relinquish the office of Governor-General. He made his decision because he believed the events of 1975 and the position into which he had been forced while serving as Governor-General of Australia had left some scars on the Australian body politic, which would be more quickly healed if he stepped down. Sir John protected the Australian people and Parliament according to the law, according to the Constitution and according to his duty as Governor-General. The attempt of the Labor Government to stay in power in defiance of Parliament compelled his proper and inevitable dismissal of that Government. An executive governing without the sanction of the Parliament is the hallmark, not of a democracy, but of a dictatorship. His difficult decision gave the people the opportunity to vote and uphold the Parliamentary system. The people of Australia passed their clear judgment on these events and Sir John's actions in the election of 1975. History will judge them just as clearly. It will support the actions Sir John Kerr was compelled to take in the extraordinary circumstances in which the Government of the day so reprehensibly placed him. Australia, as a nation of free people, owes as much to the courage of Sir John Kerr as to any man in our history. Had he not acted as he did, had he not prevented the unconstitutional designs of the last Government being consummated, the shape of Australian democracy would have been twisted and distorted. Sir John's action was opposed by a hostile and bitter minority. Division was caused by the statements of the then Leader of the Opposition, by Senator James McClelland and other members of the Labor Party who sought to make the Governor-General a scapegoat for their own actions. Because of this unjustified bitterness, the office of the Governor-General became a matter of national controversy. Sir John recognised this- we all did. He believed he could best serve Australia by standing aside, by allowing another to serve as Governor-General. This he did. His action was applauded. I believe his action was right, that it contributed to our nation 's healing process- to a return to normalcy. In this Parliament two days ago, I drew attention to Sir John's long and notable career of public service, and to the fact that both as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and as Governor-General, he would have been able to devote more of his life to serving Australia had not most unusual events intervened. At the time of Sir John's resignation, he said he looked towards new fields of constructive activity. It was clear that he still wished to serve this country in some other capacity where he could serve energetically but out of the public gaze. Recognizing Sir John's desire to continue serving Australia, I, after consultation with my senior colleagues, offered him on behalf of the Government the opportunity to do so. This became possible after the Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to me on 1 February, advising that in his judgment the Australian diplomatic posts at Los Angeles. Bombay and UNESCO should be reopened. As a result of that advice from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and after consultation with my colleagues, the Government decided to offer Sir John the post of Ambassador to UNESCO. The Government took this step in the firm belief that Sir John Kerr would fill the post with honour and as ably as any man available from within or without the public service. The Government believed that having served this nation honourably, Sir John should not be cast aside, relegated to the shadows, simply because he was forced by the Government of the day to make a difficult decision. The Government believed that he had earned the right to serve the nation quietly, at peace with himself, at peace with the nation- at peace with his family. There were people in this community who were determined that this should not be so. Since his appointment as Ambassador to UNESCO, the attacks on him in the Parliament and attacks outside it have been renewed. Sir John Kerr, once having discharged his duty to the nation under the most difficult circumstances, has no wish to continue as the centre of public dispute, making it impossible for him and his family to live the normal life to which we are all entitled. An Ambassador at UNESCO trying to carry out his functions under these conditions would find it impossible to discharge the responsibilities of his office."
"DV4","I can only deplore the actions that led to this decision. The bitterness of the attack, especially in another chamber, since Sir John left the protection of the office of Governor-General, has shown that the Labor Party still blame him when in logic and in justice, they should be blaming themselves. They are still seeking to find a scapegoat for their own misdeeds. The A.L.P.'s refusal to allow Sir John to serve his country in peace has been despicable; their actions and statements on this matter have served only to discredit themselves. There have been some who have sought to confuse the high purpose of this man with the remuneration he would have received in his new post. If this is to be a point of principle, then it should equally have been applied to appointments such as that of Senator Murphy to the High Court, Mr Barnard to an ambassadorship. The principle of taking a full salary while retaining their pension was established by the previous Labor Government. It is plain that this itself is not the major matter of dispute. If there are others who believe Sir John's actions in 1 975 to have been proper and necessary, but who now want to pass him by, who want to forget he ever existed and deny him the possibility of service; I only ask them to ask themselves how much justice, how much fairness there is in that view. By his decision, Sir John Kerr leaves public life. A long and distinguished public career is thus ended. I respect his decision. I cannot argue with it. To be an ambassador, constantly pilloried, constantly in the public glare, who had his family placed under intolerable stress, was something he did not want; he deserved better. I feel shame for those events which led to this decision. I expected less meanness, more generosity and more understanding of a person who only wanted to serve his nation. 1 can only hope that all Australians will now show Sir John the decency and respect in his retirement that his great integrity and courage in public office have earned him. Sir John Kerr can hold his head high as he leaves the public arena he has served so faithfully and well."
"N/A","Mr Murdoch conveniently returned to Australia during the general election campaign. He announced a policy of political neutrality for his fleet, until he realised there was a possibility of the election of a Labor government. All of his newspapers- metropolitan dailies, suburban newspapers and country newspapers- and his radio stations came out with full guns blazing against the Labor Party. One only has to look at the front page editorial of the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the day before the election- the editorial on 9 December headed'We can't afford a change '-to realise this. It was shifted from about page 3 to the front page of the Daily Telegraph. We saw on television Mr Kerry Packer, the Managing Director of the Channel 9 network, meeting the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, at the Bulletin World Champion Golf Tournament, showing Mr Fraser on the Channel 9 television network throughout the nation as a mere mortal who appeared to be vitally interested in the sport of golf. We heard rumours about Sir Reginald Ansett of the Channel 0 network putting up the money for the Sir Henry Bolte advertisements which were shown in Victoria. We heard about the Labor advertisements getting to Channel 10 in Sydney and suddenly ending up in the hands of the Liberal Party Executive. Doubtless, when one takes into account the country Press it is only axiomatic to say that there was a one-sided election campaign and a one-sided election results. The whole weight of media operations throughout the length and breadth of this nation was fanatically directed to ensuring the election of one particular party. I suggest that that situation is not for the good of this nation. It is the direct antithesis of democracy. We need objectivity and balance in this country. That has to be achieved if Australia is to reach political maturity and a state of full democracy. The time has therefore well arrived when the monopoly control of Australian media has to be looked at very seriously, as has been happening in the United States of America."
"KAS","It is now two years and nearly four months since Sir John Kerr determined the commission of the honourable E. G. Whitlam. Criticism of the former Governor-General in scurrilous terms has persisted, and as a result he does not now intend to take up the post in Paris which had been offered to him. It is as well to remind the community and those who have protested so often against Sir John Kerr that he gave good reason for his actions in those days in 1975. 1 know of no persons, particularly those who have criticised Sir John, who have directed their criticism at the written explanation he gave for his actions. Those people have been incapable of criticising logically. Their weakness leads them only to personal abuse of Sir John and to their dishonour. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the statement issued from Government House on 11 November 1975 and the contents of the letter written on that day to the then Prime Minister. Leave granted. The documents read as follows-"
