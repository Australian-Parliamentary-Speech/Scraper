"7.00E+04","I thank the senator for his question. The bottom line, Senator, is: no, I cannot confirm anything that you have told me. I do not have a brief from the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, who is responsible for reconciliation. In relation to those matters, all I can do is take the full detail of your question on notice. I will get back to you quickly about it. I can add that, when people seek a meeting of one sort or another, and then one later finds that the media has been invited and you have not been informed of that, it is sometimes quite understandable to say, `Look, I'm sorry, I thought I was having a private meeting, not a media circus.' I do not say that to confirm that is Minister Ruddock's view. I do not know, I have not discussed it with him and I do not have a brief. So I will take the details on notice and come back to you.","12"

"7.00E+04","I thank the senator for her question and for her interest in these matters. It is true that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare issued a report last year showing death rates from heroin-related overdoses had increased threefold between 1983 and 1995. That is a massive explosion and a very serious problem for Australia. The deaths in fact increased from 21 per million to 65 per million in 1995. This government recognises that addiction to illicit drugs, and heroin in particular, is a serious problem. We recognise it requires a three-pronged strategy: law enforcement is a part of it, education is a part of it and health measures are a part of it. But this battle against drugs is not the Howard government's fight alone. The fight against drugs is one we are happy to be a part of and committed to be a part of, but it is also going on in local communities, in schools and in individual families. And, of course, it also involves the state and local governments. The Howard government has committed almost $300 million in additional resources to fight illegal drug use. We have wisely decided to allocate these resources roughly equally between law enforcement on the one hand and education and harm minimisation health issues on the other. We are damaging and disrupting major drug syndicates and we are removing more and more illicit drugs from the streets. The Commonwealth will play its part. But, sadly, as Bob Carr attacks the federal government for making its contribution to the fight against drugs, his own government has not been anywhere near as successful. The recent report, Drugs, Money and Governments , has identified the New South Wales Carr government as the worst performing state government in dealing with its drug problems. The report says: The major shift in ratings over previous years was in NSW where their already negative rating was further reduced. It went on to basically conclude that expenditure on health related programs to deal with drug treatment and rehabilitation had been dropped from just over $7 a head to $6.60 in 1996-97, and it concluded: . . it is disappointing to note the very poor performance of the NSW government. NSW is the largest state and arguably has some of the most significant drug problems . . . but has failed to prioritise drug problems or make a serious commitment to reducing drug related harm. I hope the effort of the Howard government has prompted the New South Wales government to lift their game. Premier Carr claims to have done so, and I look forward—this government looks forward—to later figures showing that they have. The survey asked how Bob Carr's government had performed on a range of questions. You might like to guess, Madam President, where New South Wales came in on the criteria of ensuring that treatment programs and services were available vis-a-vis the states and territories. They came last. In identifying the extent of drug problems, they came last. And in having a clear strategy to address drug problems, they came last. There is some hope though, Madam President. The survey asked whether New South Wales was ensuring that programs are provided to prevent and reduce drug problems. They did not come last. They only came second last there. They were pipped at the post for that honour by the state of Queensland. The Carr government has shown itself to be not interested enough in doing something about drugs—in health, in education and in law enforcement; and it should put up or shut up.","12"
"GB6","At the request of Senator Faulkner, I move: That the Workplace Relations Amendment Regulations (Nos 2 and 3), as contained in Statutory Rules 1998 Nos 338 and 353 and made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 , be disallowed. I must admit when I first addressed this matter it seemed somewhat like Groundhog Day . This is, on my counting, the fifth time the Senate has been called upon to look at what could be regarded as a new instrument. In seeking to characterise what we were looking at yet again, my attention was drawn to an article by Glen Milne in yesterday's Australian , where he described the minister's behaviour on another matter—namely, that of his position on the republic—as reported by Liberal MPs as popularist and unprincipled. I call upon this depiction in relation to these regulations. I will go on further to explain why the Senate should disallow them. We will not back down on this. It is a sensible measure. It is consistent with the International Labour Organisation convention. It is consistent with what other countries do overseas. These are the baseless lies that the minister continues with in relation to these regulations.","17"
"5K4","You are just starting to listen now to the debate, are you? These regulations and the underhanded way that they were introduced are another betrayal of the Australian people. Do not forget this government's broken promises and how over the last couple of years they have really revealed their true colours on many issues of importance to Australians. The government, as senators would know, wooed voters with weasel words and rhetoric about delivering to families. They wooed voters with weasel words about protecting the poor, the needy and the vulnerable in our community. They wooed voters with weasel words about guaranteeing that no worker would be worse off under the new industrial relations regime of the coalition government. John Howard and Peter Reith promised to give workers a right of appeal if they had been unfairly dismissed. What they did not say is that, if you happen to work for a small business, that promise just does not count. You have got no right of appeal in that circumstance. All workers in that situation have been betrayed yet again by the Howard government because, if you do appeal, they are going to slug you by doubling the filing fee for an application for unfair or unlawful termination of employment. Of course this is at a time when workers, ordinary Australians, have a cash flow crisis. Most people, except those born with a silver spoon in their mouth and the coalition frontbench, would understand that. It is pretty clear what the government are up to here. I think it is important to place on the public record what the government has said in relation to unfair dismissal. As the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard said: I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hardworking employee. In one of his headland speeches, he said: Let me make a hard and fast commitment that when we win government we will ensure that Australia has a balanced unfair dismissal provision which is fair to both employers and employees. We won't tolerate unreasonable dismissals. Our position is very clear. If you have been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal. Of course they did not qualify it at all. They have broken these commitments to the Australian people and Australian workers. The impact of these regulations goes to the very core of the lives of all working Australians and their families. There is a very strong link between a worker's role in the work force and the quality of life that is enjoyed by a worker's family and children. John Howard promised to provide security and certainty to families. These regulations do an awful lot to dismantle the security of employment that workers hope to enjoy. Of course, security of employment is fundamental to the security workers have as a family. We do not think it is something that John Howard or this government should be messing with. Parliament has made a ruling on these exemptions. The Senate has expressed its will twice by rejecting the government's unfair dismissal exemption legislation so the government has tried to revisit the matter through the back door. Let me say that our position on this remains unchanged. I urge the Senate to stand by its earlier resolution and vote to disallow these sneaky and underhanded regulations that are so typical of the way this government does business. Question put: That the motion ( Senator Jacinta Collins's ) be agreed to.","17"
