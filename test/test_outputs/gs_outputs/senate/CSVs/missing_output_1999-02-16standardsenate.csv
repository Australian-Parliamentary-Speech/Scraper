"BH4","Madam President, I have got an answer to a question that Senator Faulkner asked yesterday and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard . Leave granted. The answer read as follows— Yesterday during Question Time Senator Faulkner asked me two questions regarding Senator Ellison and a supplementary question regarding Mr McGauran. With respect to the first question regarding Senator Ellison the premise of the question is wrong. There was no repayment. There was a payment on 29 September 1998. Following that payment the then Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin, wrote to Senator Ellison on the 1st of October 1998 acknowledging receipt of his letter and cheque and stating that the matter was now considered closed. Senator Minchin acted on the basis of proper departmental advice. The prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary advised him on Saturday, 17 October 1998 that the issue had been fully resolved to the satisfaction of Senator Minchin. This took place prior to the Prime Minister appointing Senator Ellison. The premise of the second question asked by Senator Faulkner is also incorrect. No repayment was required. A payment was made by Senator Ellison. Senator Ellison explained his reasons for doing so to the Senate yesterday. The Prime Minister's Principal Private Secretary advised him of Senator Ellison's payment on Saturday afternoon the 13th of February. With respect to the question on Mr McGauran the question seems to be based on a premise that this was a matter separate to those which were the subject of a full and comprehensive review by the Department of Finance and Administration of Mr McGauran's claims against entitlements conducted in 1997. All these matters were dealt with at that time. It will be recalled that following a thorough review and consideration by the Federal Police and the DPP no further action was deemed warranted by those agencies. The Department of Finance and Administration concluded this matter in December 1997. Mr McGauran was advised and this issue was dealt with in a Senate Estimates hearing on 25 February 1998."
"8U4","I seek leave to make a personal explanation because I claim to have been misrepresented. Leave granted. At question time today in the other place the Treasurer, Mr Costello, alleged that I was seeking to delay debate on the new tax package past 30 June. He quoted from a media release of mine from 24 November 1998 and then expressed surprise that I did not rule out this debate carrying over into July in answer to questions from the media yesterday. Madam President, the Treasurer did not bother to read all of the press release. In particular, he did not bother to read the final paragraph, which stated: Everyone knows what we have agreed to because it is all in the motion. Nowhere in the motion to set up the Senate inquiry—and I remind all senators, through you Madam President, that it was an all-party, all-person agreement—did anyone agree (not the Greens, not Senator Harradine, not the Labor Party; no-one agreed) to any final voting date. We did agree to get on with the debate on 19 April. Indeed, that was reported in the media the next day. One example—and I will just quote one—was in the Financial Review of 25 November: Despite agreeing to the inquiry reporting by April 19 next year, leaving plenty of time for a vote before June 30 1999, Senator Lees said there was no obligation on the Democrats to vote on the tax package by June 30 next year. This was the case on 24 November and it is what I reiterated yesterday at the doorstop. But I would also like to point out to the minister, about comments he made in the House today, that the three bills referred to in my 24 November media release and quoted by the Treasurer were all single bills. So the expectation of 84 hours of debate for a complicated package of what was 16, but seems to be a growing number of, bills actually designing a new tax and social security system is surely not unreasonable. I am therefore surprised that the Treasurer is surprised at my comments. However, I am no longer surprised that he would use the House of Representatives as a forum to wilfully misrepresent them."
"1M6","I seek leave to make a personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented. Leave granted. Yesterday Senator Alston said in relation to the postponement of the reporting back date on the sale of Telstra inquiry: It has been perfectly clear that there has been a pattern of obstruction and a deliberate attempt being made on a regular basis to stall proceedings. As I understand it, Senators Bishop and Allison have worked in tandem. Senator Allison has made it clear that unless Senator Bishop is there she will not be there even though she has the capacity to make a quorum if the Liberal members are in attendance. This is both wrong and mischievous on the part of Senator Alston. I have not worked in tandem with anybody to stall proceedings. The arguments that he advances show his ignorance about the events leading up to yesterday and the decision making of the committee. Furthermore, there are serious questions about the way the committee has been functioning, under extreme pressure from the government, I must presume. In fact, yesterday's hearing went ahead in spite of the fact that there was no quorum. The hearing was attended by Senators Eggleston, Tierney and Carr and me. This was not a quorum, but the chair insisted on proceeding anyway, saying that Senator Payne would arrive shortly. She did not arrive at all. If anyone is putting at risk the time line for completion of this inquiry, it is the government; it is not the Democrats. If there was any question that I might be attempting to stall or delay proceedings, that was my opportunity to indicate to the chair that we had no quorum; and that would have effectively cancelled the hearing. But I did not do that, and I did not do it because I have at all times attempted to be cooperative, however absurd the government's time lines turn out to be. There is no need for me to go over those time lines. Senator Bishop did much of this yesterday. But it must be said that submissions to this important inquiry closed on 15 January. The government says that there have been two months but, as we all know, December and January are the worst possible times to be organising an inquiry, even leaving aside the fact that there are two other inquiries competing with that committee at present. The point I want to make today is that on this inquiry, as on all others, I have made every attempt to fit in with the wishes of the chair and the other members of the committee. I would like to take the Senate through some of the events leading up to yesterday's hearing. On Thursday, 3 February the hearing in Canberra was scheduled to finish at 4.45 p.m."
"H15","I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Bill 1999, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings. I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings. I seek leave to have the statement incorporated. Leave granted. The statement read as follows — Year 2000 Information Disclosure Bill 1999 Purpose To encourage disclosure and exchange of information about Year 2000 computer processing remediation actions by limiting legal liability for statements concerning Year 2000 readiness. Reasons for urgency Passage of the legislation in the Autumn sittings is essential to ensure that information about Year 2000 readiness is freely disseminated as soon as possible. The timely disclosure of information will be important in assisting both public and private organisations to address their Year 2000 needs. Circulated by authority of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Senator Woodley to move, on the next day of sitting: That the Senate— notes that: the Government has indicated that it is considering demolishing the Aboriginal tent embassy by using section 8A (2) of the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance 1932 (ACT), and the tent embassy is listed as a `significant place' in the Australian Heritage Commission's Register of the National Estate, and that this means that the Commonwealth, the National Capital Authority and the Australian Federal Police have an obligation under section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 to inform the Australian Heritage Commission of any action they are proposing to take in relation to demolishing the site; condemns the Government for provoking anger among indigenous and non-indigenous Australians by raising the possibility of demolishing the tent embassy, a place which has long been recognised as a significant place by indigenous and non-indigenous Australians and has been formally recognised as such by the register; and calls on the Government to: immediately abolish any plans to demolish the tent embassy, and consult with the Ngunnawal people of the Australian Capital Territory with regard to the possibility of constructing a formal memorial at the site of the tent embassy to commemorate the important role the site has played in the struggle for the rights of indigenous Australians since it was first constructed in 1972. Senator Cook to move, on the next day of sitting: That the Senate— notes the tragic loss of life among sailors in the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race and the heroic efforts of the rescue services in saving lives in mountainous seas and atrocious conditions; expresses: its sympathies for the families and friends of Glyn Charles, Bruce Guy, Phil Skeggs, Jim Lawler, John Dean and Mike Bannister, the six yachtsmen who died or were tragically lost at sea in the course of the race, and its gratitude for the rescues of some 55 sailors; acknowledges the professionalism and courageous efforts above and beyond the call of duty by the many men and women from the various rescue agencies involved, amongst them, personnel from: Victorian Polair helicopter aircrews Westpac Lifesaver rescue helicopter aircrews NRMA Careflight Gary Ticehurst, G & A Ticehurst Helicopters the crew of Moira Elizabeth the crew of Josephine Jean ACT & SE NSW Aero-medical Helicopter Service Telstra Control radio, especially Lew Carter aboard STS Young Endeavour Lt Commander Neil Galletly and the crew of STS Young Endeavour Victorian and New South Wales police, especially the Victorian airwing and the Eden police Royal Australian Air Force, especially the aircrews of the spotter aircraft Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Eden Royal Australian Navy, especially the crew of HMAS Wollongong Australian Maritime Safety Authority; notes that there are a number of inquiries investigating the disaster, foremost of which are those inquiries being conducted by the New South Wales Coroner and the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia; and trusts that the combined findings of the inquiries are properly implemented and result in safer standards for yachts, equipment and skill levels for all people who venture to sea in boats. Senator Brown to move, on the next day of sitting: That the Senate notes that: the Computer Services Corporation (CSC) wrote to all senators on 4 February 1999 announcing the donation of computer equipment from electorate offices to the Computer for Schools Program run by Education Networks of Australia and that this commitment was accepted by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp); on 9 February 1999, (CSC) wrote to senators withdrawing the offer so as to `allow electorate offices to purchase the second hand equipment'; and calls on (CSC) and the Minister to revert to the original decision to donate the computers to Australia's schools. Senator Ian Campbell to move, on the next day of sitting: That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the National Health Act 1953 , and for related purposes.

Senator Ian Campbell to move, on the next day of sitting: That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 , and for related purposes. Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 1999 . Senator Stott Despoja to move, on the next day of sitting: That the Senate— condemns: the decision by the Government to force unemployed persons who fail to meet government standards of literacy and numeracy into remedial courses under threat of losing income support, and the inappropriate use of coercion against some of the most vulnerable members of society to address such a complex and sensitive issue; and urges the Government: to change this decision, and instead take immediate action to rectify the flaws in the referral process which has prevented many young people from accessing these remedial courses, and to cease its attacks on young people, and young jobseekers in particular, and direct its employment efforts towards job creation, rather that continued `scapegoating'. Senator Ian Campbell to move, on the next day of sitting: That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the law relating to therapeutic goods, and for related purposes. Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 ."
"H15","I table a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the second report on the deaths of Australian based journalists in East Timor in 1975, together with the report and a copy of a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Indonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard . Leave granted. The statement read as follows — I watched the report on the ABC's Foreign Correspondent program on 20 October 1998 concerns the deaths of five Australian-based journalists at Balibo in 1975. While not usually persuaded by journalistic crusades, I was struck by the account presented by the alleged new eye-witness to the deaths of the journalists. Having taken a transparent and open attitude to this matter over the years I felt that further inquiry was justified into this new account and that I owed it to the families to see that all available information relating to the deaths of their loved ones was thoroughly examined. I therefore asked Mr Sherman to look again at the deaths of the five Australia-based journalists. Mr Sherman's brief was to evaluate any information about the deaths emerging from or relevant to the Foreign Correspondent program, which was in addition to that covered in his first report. As the new information related to the deaths of the journalists at Balibo, Mr Sherman did not look again at the death of Roger East—nor was he was offered any new information on the death of Roger East. As I did when I tabled Mr Sherman's first report in 1996, I emphasise that the Government has been thoroughly transparent on this issue. At the beginning of the second evaluation I said that Mr Sherman would have full access to all material held by the Government on the matter. Mr Sherman did ask for access to a variety of material, including relevant intelligence material, and for interviews with a number of former government officials who worked with this material. The Government cooperated fully, and respected Mr Sherman's independence at all times. Mr Sherman sets out his account of the information from Government sources in Chapter 5, and his conclusions about it are on page 139. The Government is also giving favourable consideration to the publication of documents relating to this historical period and a final decision will be made in due course. In his letter to me covering the second report, Mr Sherman states that he recognises the Government may be concerned that his references to intelligence material disclose details of sources and methods relating to the gathering of intelligence. The Government takes disclosure of such information very seriously, and has therefore decided not to include in the tabled version of the second report some references which could disclose sources of intelligence. These references are a very small component of Mr Sherman's report, and their length is apparent in paragraphs 5.28, 5.29 and 5.30. While the Government regrets having to take this action, it does not affect the conclusion Mr Sherman makes about the intelligence material, or his overall findings about the deaths. I thank Mr Sherman for the care and attention he has devoted to this important task. I want to express the Government's appreciation for the manner in which he has discharged his responsibilities. The conclusions of Mr Sherman's second report are in Chapter 8. Mr Sherman concludes that the Balibo 5 were killed: at Balibo, early in the morning of 16 October 1975 probably before 7.00 am; by an attacking force, consisting of Indonesian troops and anti-Fretilin East Timorese but under the control of Indonesian officers; in circumstances of continuing fighting between attackers end defenders or at least before the attackers had secured their objective. Contrasting with the hearsay accounts of the deaths in the 1996 report, the bases for these conclusions include the accounts of three individuals who claim to have witnessed at least one of the killings. I am not going to comment in detail on Mr Sherman's findings as the report speaks clearly enough for itself, although I would note that he concludes that the evidence available on the Balibo killings is quite inconsistent, particularly as to circumstances of death. Mr Sherman produced his report on the basis of information available outside Indonesia. The Government asked, at the highest levels of the Indonesian Government, that Mr Sherman be allowed to visit Indonesia in conducting his evaluation. The Indonesian Government did not agree to this request and we cannot compel it to do so, any more than it can compel the Australian Government to do something which we might or might not want to do. Nevertheless, I have again written to my Indonesian counterpart, Mr Ali Alatas, asking him to pursue any further information which would throw additional light on the conclusions reached. In the letter I also ask again for any additional information the Indonesian Government is able to provide us on the death of Roger East, whose killing was a concern of Mr Sherman's first report. I am happy today to table that letter along with the second report. In its approach to the second report, as with the first, the Government has remained concerned for the next of kin. Officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have provided copies of the report to the journalists' relatives and invited their questions and comments on it. The Australian Government deeply regrets the deaths and remains willing to receive any credible new information about them. In this context, and as part of our transparent approach, the Government would be favourably disposed to proposals for a parliamentary inquiry on this matter, should the parliament wish."
"XI4","This evening I want to speak about the appearance in March of Australia before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, so I am particularly pleased that Minister John Herron is in the chamber. Many senators will not be aware that there is a process which enables the UN committee responsible for the compliance of parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination to seek from countries their particular response when there is criticism of that country's policies, and tonight I want to detail some of these processes. At the meeting in Geneva in August last year, a draft decision prepared by Mr Banton, Mr Wolfrum and Mr van Boven was introduced stating that there were worrying developments in Australia regarding the situation of Aboriginal people. I cannot go through all of this debate at the United Nations CERD committee because it goes from points 29 to 51—over five pages. There was quite a considerable debate of concern, which I will summarise with this statement by Mr Wolfrum: . . the situation in Australia was clearly deteriorating. It was deeply regrettable that institutions such as the post of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, which the Committee had praised so highly in 1994, were disappearing. Aboriginals were being marginalized, their life expectancy was about 10 years less than that of the white population and the illiteracy rate among Aboriginals was approximately five times higher. Similar concerns were expressed about the native title legislation and whether or not it complied with the convention—a debate which we had regarding the Racial Discrimination Act at the time of the debate in this place. Tonight, in the spirit of reconciliation, I want to comment on how the government could maximise its appearance before the CERD committee as an opportunity to move forward in regard to the reconciliation process that the Prime Minister has committed himself to. A report has been prepared by the Attorney-General's Department and has been released. I have sought permission from the Government Whip to table the document and that has been granted. I now seek leave to table the Attorney-General's Department report. Leave granted. For those who would like to look at this document, it is available on the Attorney-General's web site. But I think it is important that honourable senators have the opportunity to read it. I have to say that it is not a comprehensive document; it is not a visionary document. If Australia is being asked to justify its position in relation to meeting the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, I would have thought the government would go out of its way to spell out its vision for the future, its vision for reconciliation. The Australian government is already about 2½ years overdue with its periodic report on how it is moving to implement policies that overcome racial discrimination, and it would seem that this was the perfect opportunity. Indeed, if you were as cynical as I am on such occasions, you could even argue that the govern ment could have deflected some of the attention about the two issues that the committee raised by focusing on its vision for reconciliation. I find the document extremely disappointing. But I think there is still time for the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation—Phillip Ruddock—and you, Minister Heron, to retrieve the situation not only in terms of fundamental justice for Aboriginal people in this country but for Australia's international reputation. On Australia Day this year, in an advertisement headed `It's Time for a Treaty', 57 Aboriginal leaders publicised their demand for `the Australian government to sign a treaty with Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples', stating that it `should be concluded by 26 January 2001 as a symbolic date for negotiated settlement between the nation and the indigenous peoples'. I know that this government has said all along—and in opposition it was also policy—that there would not be a treaty. But politics is the art of compromise. The Prime Minister could give a public commitment to negotiating policy with indigenous people. For example, we could have negotiation here, out at the front of Parliament House, in relation to the tent embassy, instead of the confrontation that has developed. If, when Australia speaks at the United Nations on 12 March, there could be a statement of absolute commitment for negotiation, even that would be a major step forward. Also, I believe the government could and should seriously reconsider the abolition of the position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. It does not mean a lot of dollars; it is not a major step backwards in terms of government policy—and obviously I am looking at it from the government's point of view, not mine. But I am looking for realistic ways in which the government can set a new tone on 12 March in Geneva. I am realistic; I know that there is no way this government will turn its back on the Wik legislation. So I predict that it will be criticised by the United Nations committee for that particular piece of legislation. So why not balance that criticism by trying to recognise the concerns and giving a commitment to reinstate the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner? In addition, I think an important issue is the selection of the Australian representative for Geneva. We do not yet know whether it will be a public servant—and, with every respect to public servants, I hope it is not. I believe that this is an opportunity, an occasion, for the attendance of a senior minister—the Attorney-General himself, Phillip Ruddock, even the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister were really committed to reconciliation, if he were really concerned about the way in which Australia is being portrayed internationally as to its treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, then he himself would be there. That may seem a bit unrealistic, but I think it would be a very good opportunity. I think it is appropriate that on that occasion the government make some very strong statements of commitment for the future—commitment to negotiation; for it to recommit to having the position of Social Justice Commissioner, which was seen by the United Nations as very innovative and forward looking; and commitment to genuine reconciliation which, of course, will involve recognition of ATSIC and reinstatement of many of the programs that are now so underfunded."
"UI4","asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 2 December 1998: On how many occasions did the department refer unauthorised disclosures to the Australian Federal Police between March 1996 and October 1998. In each instance where an investigation has been undertaken has that investigation been concluded. Have any officers been charged with offences relating to unauthorised disclosures that occurred during this period; if so, how many."
"UI4","asked the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 11 and 12 November 1998: With reference to the report prepared by Mr Peter Kennedy under the Public Service Act 1922 into advice given in relation to tabling of material in the house of Representatives on 29 May 1997 and released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 on 2 June 1998: on what grounds under the FOI Act were specific deletions made:"
"9X5","The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows: I have been advised by the Department of Finance and Administration: All deletions, from the copy of the Kennedy report that was released under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) in June of this year, were made in accordance with one or more of Sections 36, 40, 41 and 42 of the FOI Act with one exception (see paragraph 5 be low). The copy of the report that was released was annotated to indicate where and under what sections of the FOI Act deletions were made. The reasons for deletions made in the copy of the report that was released are summarised in the attached table. Material was deleted from the Report, by the Departmental decision maker, for the following reasons: Section 36—it was decided by the Departmental decision maker that this material fell within the 'internal working document' exemption of the Act in that it contained advice, opinion and/or recommendations given by senior officers of the Department to the then Minister, or related to discussion/liaison/communications of a very high level between senior officers of the Department. On balance, it was decided by the Departmental decision maker that release would not be in the public interest. Section 40—it was decided by the Departmental decision maker that release of this material might prejudice the attainment of the objects of an examination, test or audit conducted by the agency; would disclose information that could reasonably be expected to have a substantial adverse affect on the management or assessment of personnel by the Commonwealth or by an agency; and/or that disclosure could reasonably be expected to have a substantial adverse affect on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of an agency. On balance, it was decided by the Departmental decision maker that release would not be in the public interest. Section 41—it was decided by the Departmental decision maker that release of this material would be an unreasonable disclosure of personal information concerning a number of third parties. Section 42—it was decided by the Departmental decision maker that this material concerned legal opinion obtained in the review process, and as such was subject to legal professional privilege. The Departmental decision maker considered all possible provisions of the FOI Act and, I am advised, released as much of the Report as he thought possible. The Act provides a remedy for applicants where there is disagreement with a decision. FOI requests to the Department are handled by authorised officers of the Department. In the preparation of this answer, it was noted that paragraph 7.18 had been inadvertently deleted from the copy of the report that was released under the FOI Act and a copy of that section has now been provided to the applicant. * Paragraph 7.18 was inadvertently deleted from the copy of the report released under the FOI Act and a copy of that paragraph has now been supplied to the applicant."
"1M6","asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1998: Is it a fact that the states had to present the Commonwealth with specific plans for establishing literacy programs which then had to be agreed to by the Government before being allocated extra funding for this purpose. Can a copy be provided of the literacy plans put forward by each state. Can a list be provided of the criteria schools applying for funding under the Keys to Life program must meet. Can a breakdown be provided of the funding allocated for literacy programs on a state and school by school basis. Outline how literacy funding is awarded to schools with literacy programs which do not specifically meet the criteria set down by the Commonwealth. Can a breakdown be provided of literacy funding which has been allocated to schools with literacy programs which do not specifically meet the Commonwealth's criteria on a state by state and school by school basis."
"9X5","The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: The Commonwealth this year introduced a change to administrative arrangements for Commonwealth funding for literacy in schools. As a condition of funding, states and territories and non-government education authorities were asked to provide a strategic plan on how schools will ensure that students meet the national literacy standard by the end of Year 3. A copy of each literacy plan was provided to the Senate Legislation Committee during August 1998 in response to Senator Carr's question of 9 June 1998. A set of plans has also been forwarded to Senator Allison. The Commonwealth is not able to provide information on the Victorian Government's Keys to Life program (now known as the Early Years literacy program). This information can be provided by Education Victoria. The Commonwealth is not able to provide information on literacy program funding on a school by school basis. The Commonwealth can only provide a breakdown of funding allocated for literacy programs by state and sector (allocations for 1998 attached). The Commonwealth sets out broad guidelines for administration of Literacy Program funds. State and Territory government and non-government education authorities are responsible for complying with the guidelines and meeting the accountability requirements. These are set out in the Commonwealth Programs for Schools Quadrennial Administrative Guidelines 1997 to 2000 which are publicly available. No. See answers to Questions 2.2 and 3 above.

"8O6","asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: How many officers are currently employed in Australian Search and Rescue (AUS-SAR). Does AUS-SAR consist of two separate components, a maritime cell and an aviation cell. How many officers are employed in each cell. Are staff from each cell currently being cross-trained in the other cell; if so, is this being done: (a) to reduce costs; and (b) as a result of a government direction. Has this program been subjected to a formal analysis that gives the safe minimum number of staff; if so: (a) who undertook that analysis; (b) when was the work commenced; (c) when was it completed; and (d) what were the major findings of the report. Can a copy of the report be provided. Does AUS-SAR plan to reduce the number of staff employed over the next 2 years; if so, by how many."
"YW4","The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: There are 57 AMSA officers currently employed in Australian Search and Rescue (AusSar). No. There are no cells in AusSAR. AusSAR is a division of AMSA and, within that division, there are three sections—Operations, Search and Rescue Resources, and Policy—and an Executive area. Eight (8) officers are employed in the Policy section. Six (6) officers are employed in the Search and Rescue Resources section. Thirty-nine (39) officers are employed in the Operations section. Four (4) officers are employed in the Executive area. No. The creation of AusSAR brought together the search and rescue operations of AMSA and Airservices Australia into a single operational unit, namely AusSAR. There has never been a requirement or expectation that staff from one area or background be able to fully perform the duties of staff from another area or background. However, familiarisation of some staff between areas is occurring. The benefit of familiarisation is that with a greater understanding of what each of the areas within the operations room is about, staff will be better able to contribute as a cohesive team in a search and rescue incident. Such familiarisation training is not being done to reduce costs nor is it being done as a result of a government direction. No. N/A. It is anticipated that the current staffing levels will remain unchanged."
"1M6","asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 23 November 1998: Is it a fact that there have been 23 dugong mortalities in 1998, the same number of mortalities as in 1997 before dugong protected areas (DPAs) were implemented. (a) How many of these mortalities were due to gill netting; and (b) can gill netting be conclusively ruled out as a cause of death for any of the 23 dugongs. Given that the dugong death rate has not declined with the implementation of DPAs, will a review be conducted into the adequacy of these areas. Given that Zone A DPAs do not permit netting: (a) if dugong mortalities due to netting have been reported in these areas, will the Minister consider upgrading them from Zone B, where netting is permitted, to Zone A. k, Will the Minister consider declaring further DPAs in areas that were originally recommended for inclusion by independent experts, particularly where dugong mortalities may have occurred in 1998, indicating that such recommendations should be acted on."
"BH4","The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: Twenty-seven confirmed dugong carcasses (not including animals taken legally by indigenous hunters) have been reported in Queensland for the year to 30 November 1998, compared with 28 and 32 confirmed mortalities reported in Queensland for the same period in 1996 and 1997 respectively. The 1998 deaths comprise 12 from within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area; 10 from within the Hervey Bay and the Great Sandy Straits region; and 5 from the Moreton Bay region. It is important to note that, since the implementation of Dugong Protected Areas in January 1998, there has been no confirmed deaths as a result of gill netting in any of the Zone A DPAs or Zone B DPAs. (a) Determinations on the cause of death have been made for 10 of the 27 dugong carcasses. In two instances drowning in a gill net has been identified as a cause of death, one near Cairns and one at Midge Point north of Mackay. Other identified causes were: disease (confirmed for one animal from Hervey Bay, and assessed as probable for another animal from Hervey Bay and one from Moreton Bay); boat strike (in two cases from Moreton Bay); non-permitted hunting (confirmed for one case from Clairview near Mackay); research (one death during research in Moreton Bay with an assessment that the animal died `probably as a result of an existing heart disease'); and a `probable human-related cause' (identified by the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage for a carcass near Townsville). The precise cause of deaths was unable to be determined for 17 of the 27 dugong because the carcasses were too decomposed or they were unable to be removed for necropsy. Since the establishment of DPAs in January 1998, there have been fewer confirmed deaths due to gill netting along the Queensland coast. In particular, there have been no confirmed deaths in DPAs due to gill netting. In any event, the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council is committed to ongoing review of the success of the emergency measures to protect dugong on the Great Barrier Reef. This ongoing review will include an examination of the effectiveness of surveillance and enforcement activity in the DPAs. I am pleased to say that an additional $230 000 has been provided recently by the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments through the Ministerial Council to increase surveillance and enforcement in the DPAs. This is expected to result in an additional 132 vessel patrols and 75 surveillance flights into the DPAs in the first half of 1999, together with special project and educational operations. The Commonwealth Government has also promised to provide an extra $3.4 million over 3 years to enhance surveillance and enforcement in the Great Barrier Reef The ongoing review will address all causes of death including gill netting. Dugong mortalities due to netting had not been confirmed in any of the DPAs, including Zone B DPAs, to the end of November 1998. The Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council is committed to ongoing review of the measures it has instituted for the conservation of dugongs in the Great Barrier Reef and adjacent areas and has not ruled out any additional courses of action for that purpose."
"QD4","asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Has Emergency Management Australia (EMA) assessed the likelihood of disruption or emergency posed by the `millennium bug'; if so, can a copy of the analysis be provided. What steps has EMA taken to develop contingency plans for such emergencies. (a) Who has been consulted in developing contingency plans; and (b) what agencies and community organisations would be involved. What funding has been allocated to strengthen the capacity of the community to respond to contingencies or emergencies created by `Y2K'."
"BE4","The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: The protection of life and property is the responsibility of State and Territory Governments and, on behalf of the Commonwealth, Emergency Management Australia (EMA) has been working with peak State and Territory emergency management bodies to assess the likelihood of disruption to community lifelines due to Year 2000 remediation failures. A national workshop to share strategies for reducing the risks to health and safety of the community and for managing the consequences of remediation failures was held on 10-11 December 1998. State and Territory emergency managers noted that the extent and duration of the effects of failures are unknown but were hopeful that effects would not be catastrophic and that, with adequate funding, they could be dealt with. Notwithstanding, given that there is uncertainty, contingency planning should be based on the worst case. The main responsibility for developing contingency plans rests with States and Territories. However, EMA will be developing a sub-plan to the Commonwealth Government Disaster Response Plan (COMDISPLAN) to ensure that the Commonwealth Government is prepared to respond to Year 2000 specific requests from States and Territories for Commonwealth Government assistance. (a) In developing a contingency plan EMA has undertaken preliminary consultation with Commonwealth agencies through the Commonwealth Counter Disaster Task Force and with State and Territory emergency management agencies. The main government agencies being consulted are the Office for Government Online at the Commonwealth level and State and Territory emergency management peak bodies. No direct community consultation is planned by EMA as this will be undertaken by State and Territory emergency management agencies in developing their plans. EMA has not received any additional funding for Y2K planning. Costs for activities conducted to date have been met from within existing resource allocations or on a shared basis with States and Territories."
"QD4","asked the Minister for Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: With reference to the Mt McCall Road in the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage area, which the Minister decided to keep open, contrary to the original management plan: In the 1997-98 financial year how much was spent on: (a) road maintenance; and (b) upgrading the haulage way from the Franklin River. (a) Which rafting companies used the route to run short trips down the Franklin River during the 1997-98 financial year; (b) how many trips did each company make; and (c) how much did they pay in fees. Which rafting companies are currently offering short trips down the Franklin River. Have the following works been completed, as promised by the Minister at the estimates hearings in November 1997: (a) provision of washdown facilities (include a description of the facilities, their location and the procedures in place to ensure that they are used); (b) remedial work to mitigate erosion (include a description of the works under taken); and (c) revegetation of verges, (include a map of the area revegetated). Who is liable if anyone is injured using the haulage way or the road. When will the decision to keep the road open next be reviewed."
"BH4","The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: (a) In the 1997-98 financial year, $22,000 was spent on maintenance of the Mt McCall Road. In the 1997-98 financial year, $28,000 was spent on upgrading the haulage way from the Franklin River. (a) The following rafting companies used the route to run short trips during the 1997-98 financial year: Peregrine Adventures Tasmanian Wild River Adventures Rafting Tasmania Each company conducted the following number of trips in the 1997-98 financial year: • Peregrine Adventures—22 • Tasmanian Wild River Adventures—10 • Rafting Tasmania—11 . These companies have paid or will pay the following in fees relating to the 1997-98 financial year: • Peregrine Adventures—$3546 • Tasmanian Wild River Adventures—$1048 • Rafting Tasmania—$1506 . The following rafting companies are currently offering short trips on the Franklin River: • Peregrine Adventures • Rafting Tasmania • Tasmanian Wild River Adventures • Headwaters Travel • Tasland Adventures . (a) A locked gate has been placed across the Mt McCall Road. In order to access the road, users must attend the Queenstown Parks &Wildlife Ser vice (P&WS) Office to obtain a permit and the key to the gate. All private vehicles are inspected by P&WS staff. Those requiring washdown are directed to washdown facilities at the local service station. High pressure washdown facilities will be installed at the Queenstown P&WS Office this financial year. A consultant's (Duckett) report on erosion control has been fully implemented. This work involved the re-opening of the original table and cross drains and the on going maintenance of these drains. All road verges on the Mt McCall Road were revegetated in 1992. The Tasmanian Government is responsible. All installation work meets engineering risk management standards. The general public are advised that they are using the facilities at their own risk. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Ministerial Council endorsed the 1998 Draft Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Management Plan on 11 December 1998. The Mt McCall Road will remain open under the new Plan. This Plan will come into effect early in 1999. The Plan has a 10 year life and is scheduled to be fully reviewed in January 2009. An interim review of significant issues is scheduled for January 2004."
"7Y6","asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 25 November 1998: Is the Minister aware that the decision to transfer to digital transmission has resulted in rural and regional communities being required to purchase a new system of receiving radio and television signals. Is the Minister aware that this change in remote satellite services will cost these communities up to $6,500 per decoder and that some of these communities currently use three different decoders or more and that the subsidy available to these communities is only in the range of $2,500 to $3,500 for each decoder. Why are these rural and regional communities forced to bear the added burden of the cost of replacing these decoders when Australians in metropolitan areas receive the same television and radio signals at no cost to the individual communities, particularly given the reliance on these services in such remote communities."
"LD4","The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: Yes. Optus has previously delivered television and associated radio services by analogue satellite transmission to remote areas of Australia, beyond the reach of terrestrial transmission networks. Reflecting worldwide trends, Optus has decided for commercial reasons to digitise its satellite operations, including the delivery of remote area broadcasting services (RABS). Digital conversion of RABS services is occurring progressively this year and is currently scheduled to be completed by mid 1999. Optus' decision necessitates the replacement of existing analogue decoders with digital units to continue to receive RABS. I understand that existing satellite dishes should in most cases be able to receive the digital signal without modification. This also applies to RABS digital transmissions by Telstra, using the PanAmSat PAS 2 satellite, in Western Australia. In the deregulated satellite and communications market, Telstra has competed with Optus for the digital transmission of RABS. — (3) The Government is making a significant contribution to ease the transition for remote area viewers to digital RABS transmission, even though transmission arrangements are primarily commercial matters for the industry. Technological changes must be expected over time to satellite delivery of broadcasting services, just as changes occur to terrestrial broadcasting—such as the conversion from black and white to colour television and the planned move to digital terrestrial television broadcasting. Reflecting the Government's strong commitment to regional Australia, in November 1997 I announced an $11.2 million package under the Government's $250 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund (RTIF) to subsidise the cost of digital decoders in remote areas. The independent RTIF Board set aside $8 million for this assistance from within the Fund, to which the Federal Government added a further $3.2 million. The RTIF Board has determined that a subsidy of $750 is payable for the replacement of each existing analogue decoder in households with direct to home (DTH) reception, $2,500 for replacement of each analogue decoder at community self-help retransmission sites, and $3,500 for replacement of decoders at remote Aboriginal community retransmission sites. These subsidies represent a significant contribution towards meeting the cost of digital decoders which, I understand, retail for about $1,000, in the case of DTH units, and $3,500—$6,500 for most retransmission units. For the subsidised cost of digital decoders, remote area viewers will also obtain access, for the first time, to national satellite-delivered ABC Triple J and Parliamentary and News Network radio services, and satellite-delivered SBS television in remote and regional Western Australia. Digital decoders also afford potential access to internet, data transfer and pay TV as these services are developed in regional areas. The Government is making a major separate contribution through the RTIF to facilitate the availability of online services in regional Australia through a range of projects. The Government remains committed to further improving the quality and range of broadcasting services available to Australians, within the limits imposed by competing national budget priorities, and to ensuring equitable access to such services in regional Australia. During the recent election campaign, the Government announced that it would establish a $120 million Television Fund to extend SBS television to transmission areas of more than 10,000 people, and to fix major 'black spots' where the reception of television services is currently unavailable or where the quality of transmission is poor. The Television Fund will be established from the proceeds of the planned sale of a further 16 per cent of Telstra. Legislation for the introduction of digital terrestrial television broadcasting services, which are scheduled to commence in regional areas between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2004, provides for a review into whether any amendments to laws are needed to ensure that underserved regional communities are provided with up to the same number of commercial television services as are provided in metropolitan areas. The review is required to be conducted by 1 January 2000."

"DX5","asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 November 1998: With reference to the apparently imminent deployment of rocket-fired target drones from HMAS Stirling naval base on Garden Island: Is it a fact that it has been decided to launch the rockets from a naval site near the northern end of Garden Island that this site was not the subject of the environmental assessment or public consultation process. Is it a fact that three misfirings of the JP7/KALKARRA-EM system have occurred recently on the eastern seaboard leading to bush being set alight and a rocket landing on a public beach; if so, what steps are being taken to ensure that public safety on the southern Perth metropolitan coastline and the fire sensitive native vegetation on Garden Island are protected during the current launch plan."
"BE4","The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: It is expected the Kalkara aerial target system will commence operations around March/April 1999 from Garden Island and be launched to seawards from Gilbert Point. The site was carefully chosen after a study of the environmental aspects together with a broad range of other factors to ensure the operation of the aerial target system did not represent a risk to the environment or public safety. A public briefing covering the proposal to operate Kalkara from Gilbert Point was conducted at HMAS Stirling in late July 1998 with another briefing scheduled to be held in early 1999. As of 30 November 1998 there have been eight Kalkara flights from the Jervis Bay airfield in a flight trials program for the aerial target system. There have been no misfirings of the jet engine or the launch booster motor and there have been no instances of bush being set alight as a result of Kalkara operations. On 8 July 1998 during the conduct of flight three, a payload pod (not a rocket) did fall from the target aircraft shortly after launch and fell into the sea a short distance off a headland to the east of the Jervis Bay airfield. Engineering changes to the attachment points for this pod and other payloads have since been made to ensure there is no repeat of such an incident."

"TW4","asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 8 December 1998: With reference to a recent refugee matter, in which the Minister refused to consider exercising his discretion on a case involving a Somali national, known as Mr SE: Why, under the immigration advice application assistance scheme, was Mr SE not legally represented at the Refugee Review Tribunal hearing. Was he subsequently advised of his right of appeal to the Federal court; if not, why not. Why did the Minister refuse to consider exercising his power under section 417 of the Migration Act 1958, despite interventions from Amnesty International Australia and his (Mr SE's lawyers') submission to the United Nations Committee against Torture. With reference to the Minister's refusal to exercise his power in this case and the attempted deportation: (a) why was Mr SE given such short notice of his removal; and (b) why was Mr SE not allowed to contact his lawyer and eventually transferred to Port Hedland Immigration Detention Centre as opposed to being returned to Melbourne where his lawyer is based. Would it have been cheaper to return him to Melbourne. Why was a private security firm used to deport him. Why did the Government not heed Amnesty International's representations in the case, but instead warn of `serious consequences' of campaigning on his case, despite the fact that Mr SE had given Amnesty International his consent to do so. Will the Minister confirm that Mr SE will not be deported. Does the Minister accept that Australia's domestic law falls well short of ensuring that Australia's international treaty commitments to, and other obligations under, the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are capable of being met, given that the fundamental principle of non-return to face torture or death is not present in domestic law. Why is there no safety net to catch those who do not meet the strict definition of a refugee under domestic law, but who would face torture or death on return. If the Minister claims that there is a safety net, why did it not prevent the attempted removal of Mr SE. Can details be provided of: (a) what has happened to the 19 Somali nationals who were removed from Australia in September and October 1998; (b) the circumstances of their removal; (c) where and how are they now; (d) how they were removed to Somalia; (e) how long they were in countries before being returned; (f) were they in custody; (g) in whose custody were they held; (h) under what authority; and (i) are they in safe physical and mental condition."
"7.00E+04","The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: The Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) is a non-adversarial body and legal representation is not necessary during an RRT hearing. Only the applicant has a statutory right to appear before the RRT and give evidence. The Tribunal is not required to allow any other person to address it orally about the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. As a detainee, Mr SE was offered assistance at public expense in accordance with the contract for the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme. Under this scheme the contracting migration agent is required to assist with the preparation and lodgement of an RRT application but is not generally required to be present at RRT hearings. Asylum seekers are not bound to accept offers of application assistance and are free to make whatever arrangements they wish to obtain alternative or further assistance in pursuing their claims. Yes, in writing on 22 May 1998. My power under s417 is non-delegable and non-compellable. I will consider exercising my s417 power only when I consider it may be in the public interest to do so. (a) There is no legislative obligation to inform a detainee of their date of removal from Australia. However, Mr SE had repeated notifications of removal over a three week period leading up to 19 November 1998. Mr SE was advised in writing on 23 October 1998 that he was to be removed. On 30 October 1998, he was given a further notice advising him of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' (DIMA) intention to remove him and on 16 November 1998, DIMA officers informed Mr SE's solicitor that the detainee would be removed within days. Mr SE was not prevented from contacting his legal representatives. When DIMA officers informed Mr SE at the Maribyrnong IDC of his removal arrangements on Thursday 19 November 1998, he did not ask to speak to his solicitor. He was taken to Melbourne Airport by DIMA officers with Australasian Correctional Management escorts and boarded a Qantas flight to Perth. Upon his arrival at Perth, senior DIMA officers interviewed Mr SE, as a complaint had been lodged on his behalf with the United Nations Committee Against Torture (UNCAT). Present at the interview was a representative from the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office in Perth. Mr SE was given the option of proceeding on the scheduled flight to South Africa or to proceed to the Immigration Reception Centre at Port Hedland, the closest appropriate immigration detention facility, pending the outcome of an inquiry into his circumstances by the UNCAT. Mr SE chose to stay in Australia and await the outcome of the UNCAT inquiry. No. Under the Migration Act 1958, removal of Mr SE is the responsibility of the airline carrier which brought him to Australia. The Government did not warn Amnesty International of serious consequences of campaigning on Mr SE's case. The Government contacted Amnesty International to draw their attention to an order, made by the Federal Court with the consent of Mr SE's counsel, that prohibited the publication of Mr SE's name and any information which might identify him. Amnesty International had issued an alert disclosing Mr SE's name and other identifying information on the same day that the order was made by the Federal Court. Amnesty International was advised that `serious consequences could flow from the failure to observe such an order'. That is, that the breach of a court order is a serious matter which can result in criminal charges. Mr SE has been informed that there is no intention to remove him from Australia before the UNCAT has completed its consideration. No. A safety net does exist. All people determined not to be refugees by the RRT are assessed against my Guidelines for the identification of cases where I may consider it to be in the public interest to grant a visa. The Guidelines refer to 'persons whose particular circumstances or personal characteristics provide a sound basis for a significant threat to their personal security, human rights or human dignity on return to their country of origin.' Cases that are assessed as falling within these Guidelines are referred to me for my consideration of whether or not I consider it would be in the public interest to grant a visa in the case. In addition, if a person writes to me seeking exercise of my public interest powers their case and any additional information is assessed afresh against the Guidelines and is brought to my attention so that I may consider whether to consider substituting a more favourable decision in their case. At the time that Mr SE's removal commenced, Mr SE's case had been assessed against my Guidelines on four (4) different occasions. It had been drawn to my attention on three (3) different occasions and I had declined to consider the exercise of my s417 power on each of those occasions. The safety net process operated as intended. (a) No follow up enquiries have been made concerning the whereabouts of Somalis removed from Australia. A group of 22 Somali nationals arrived in Australia in November 1997 using forged immigration documentation and were refused immigration clearance. They were detained in accordance with the Migration Act while their applications for protection visas were considered. Four were granted protection visas. Three of the group appealed to the Federal Court against the refusal of their protection visa applications. They remain in detention in Australia awaiting the outcome of their appeals. The remaining 15 persons were refused protection visas, did not appeal these decisions, and were removed from Australia in September 1998. Three other Somali nationals who arrived without authorisation by air at different times were also removed in September and October 1998. The group of fifteen was returned to the cities of Mogadishu, Baidoa, Buleberde, Kismayo and Hargeisa in Somalia according to their preferences. Of the other three Somali nationals, one was returned to Basoso, East Somalia. A second was returned to Kenya and the carrier advised that this person arranged, through a sponsor, a forward ticket to Mogadishu, Somalia, via Dubai. The third was returned to New Zealand, where he had a right to permanent residence. Any subsequent movements made by the 18 Somalis are unknown to DIMA. No information is known about their personal circumstances. By air. In accordance with the Migration Act, removal is the responsibility of the airline company that brought each person to Australia without authorisation to do so. Therefore, the carrier responsible for bringing the group to Australia made all the arrangements for the group's removal. The group of 15 was escorted to South Africa by the Australian private security firm, Chubb. The onward travel from South Africa was arranged by the South African firm, Protecting & Indemnity (P&I).
