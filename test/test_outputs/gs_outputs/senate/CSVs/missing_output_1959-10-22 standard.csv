"KT8","by leave--I should like to .join in the expressions of .sympathy to Mrs. Cahill. Mr. Cahill was a man .who served his country well in war and in peace. What always impressed me were his sense of duty and his courtesy. I simply express my sympathy -,to his widow and family in the words of Shirley - Only the actions of the just Smell sweet and blossom in the dust. Before asking honorable senators to express their sympathy to Mrs. .Cahill and her family in the traditional manner, I should like to say a few words. I support everything that has been said about the late Premier of New South Wales. I had the privilege of serving in the New South Wales Parliament for twelve years with Mr. Cahill. He was a man who had .one purpose .in life - the performance of his duty in the way that he felt it should be carried out - and' he kept in mind his objective of doing good for the community as a whole. Although pur politics differed, I always found that Mr. Cahill was one of the most courteous men one could meet. He treated all alike, irrespective of their political views. I want to say this: The State of New South Wales and the Labour movement have lost a very, very dear friend. From my heart, I extend to his wife and his family my deepest sympathy at his passing. As a mark of respect to the late Mr. Cahill, I invite honorable senators to stand in their places in silence. (Honorable senators thereupon stood in their places.)"
