"Mr. Speaker (Hon. Sir Littleton Groom) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers.","17"
"That may be so. My friend the honorable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates) interjected while I was speaking last night something about Barwells legacy. I wish to return for a moment to that subject. No doubt Sir Henry Barwell was extravagant in his administration of South Australian affairs, but he did a tremendous amount of good work.","17"
"And I repeat that such statements coming from the honorable member are contemptible.","17"
"It has been hinted that this debate must be concluded to-day. Had the Prime Minister responded to the call of humanity we could have ended the discussion in about two hours. The work people of Australia have declared in no uncertain'way, ' We want work ' ; but the Prime Minister has shown a callous disregard of their urgent need, the like of which I did not think he was capable. He has treated the motion altogether too lightly. There are in Australia to-day at least 100,000 work persons out of employment.","17"
"Some people may regard his speech as ingenuous and perhaps clever. In my opinion he was guilty of political trickery, and is deserving of the strongest censure. If we were a parliament of jokers, an assembly of light-hearted men engaged in the discussion of a matter that did not touch so vitally the life and interests of the people, there might have been some excuse for the levity of the right honorable gentleman; but in the circumstances his action was unforgivable. It is a matter for deep regret that in recent times he has not often drawn from the well of truth. Turning now to the migration policy of the Government, I direct attention to the manner in which New Zealand is dealing with this problem. In the Dominion, the Government led by Mr. Coates is of the same political colour as that led by Mr. Bruce in Australia, though its ideals may not be identical. Like Australia, New Zealand is in an unsatisfactory economic position; but unlike Australia, it is taking steps to meet the situation by restricting migration. In the annual report of the New Zealand Department of Migration there appears the following paragraph: -","12"
"In view of the economic conditions ruling at the commencement of the present year it was necessary for a reconsideration of the volume of immigration, and it was decided that during the forthcoming winter the number of assisted migrants should be reduced to a minimum.","12"
"Action on these lines has been taken on two occasions since the beginning of this year in order to relieve the present situation in New Zealand. In speeches from a public platform and in Parliament, the Prime Minister of the Dominion has stated that his Government is doing its best to improve the economic condition of the people. It has, as I have stated, taken steps to prevent migrants from entering New Zealand whilst the present economic depression continues. Even Mr. Amery, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, who recently visited Australia, returned to Great Britain with opinions somewhat modified as to the ability of this country to absorb migrants. In speeches delivered since his return to the Mother Country, he has stated that the transfer of British people to Australia is not by any means an easy matter, and that great care must be exercised to ensure that those who come to Australia shall be profitably employed. The honorable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) and other Ministerial supporters, appear to endorse the view of the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Government has no authority to prevent the influx of foreign migrants. I challenge that contention most emphatically. When dealing with this subject last year, I quoted section 3k of the Immigration Restriction Act, which reserves to the Governor-General in Council complete authority to restrict migration if the economic conditions existing in the Commonwealth warrant such a course. The Government of New Zealand is acting under a similar authority. It is generally admitted that economic conditions in Australia at the moment are most unsatisfactory. I say, therefore, that it is competent for the Government to take the necessary steps to restrict migration and so relieve the present depression. I have nothing to say personally against immigrants from European countries. Some of them are my personal friends. My contention is that since the economic position of the Commonwealth is not satisfactory, we should restrict migration, and be particularly careful not to allow an influx of migrants whose standards of living are lower than our own.","12"
"I would have no hesitation whatever in enforcing that policy whenever the economic position of Australia justified that course, and I would have no fear of international complications, because such action would be in the interests of prospective migrants. The Prime Minister knows that the Government is vested with the necessary authority, and yet he excuses the inaction of his Government by endeavouring to persuade honorable members that any restrictive action might result in grave international complications. I have in my possession a translation of a speech made by Signor Mussolini, the Prime Minister of Italy, dealing with the migration of Italian nationals to foreign countries. I may add that I obtained this translation from the Foreign Affairs branch of the Prime Ministers Department, so that the right honorable gentleman must know the views of the government of Italy on this important subject. Mussolini declares that if Italy is to have any voice in international affairs in the future she must enter the next half of this century with a population of 60,000,000. The Prime Minister has declared that the migration of Southern Europeans would not seriously affect the economic position of Australia. Official figures show, however, that in the three years, 1924-27, the excess of arrivals over departures of Europeans was 26,000, mainly from Southern Europe. On this basis we may assume that during the last five years we have added at least 40,000 people from southern European countries to the population of Australia. Can it be argued that the presence of 40,000 migrants from the other side of the world, people whose standard of living is below our own, will not have some influence on the Australian labour market?","17"
"If these men admit the correctness of the Chief Judge's view they are to be expelled from the union! Has any member of the Opposition questioned that attitude? No; they have all taken it lying down. Every one knows that it is impossible to make any progress except along the lines suggested by ' the Chief Judge. What can be said of men who claim to be the leaders of the workers and yet sit idly by while Arbitration awards are being defied even by employees in Government workshops? It cannot be argued that the employers, who in this instance are the people themselves, have any desire to cut down the wages of the men. During the last few weeks the boilermakers at Walsh Island dockyard threw the whole of the works idle because of a proposal to introduce piece-work, which is contrary to the rules of their union. That is a State Government undertaking. The Minister for Works in New South Wales has been obliged to consider the advisability of disposing of the undertaking to a private concern as a result of the current trouble. 'When the Federal Arbitration Court conceded a 44-hour week to the engineering trades it attached to the award what was understood to be a condition that piece-work should be introduced in order to assist the industry to improve production and meet enhanced costs. Walsh Island recently undertook a big contract for the construction of six steel cars a week for the State Railways Department. The management was unable to keep pace with the work and therefore called for more union workers. Great difficulty was experienced in obtaining those additional workers; consequently the management offered a bonus on the piecework system. The boilermakers' organization asked the management to abolish the system in three days, and said that in the event of its failure to do so they would have to call the men out of the workshops. The threat has been made that if the work in question is transferred to the Sydney workshops other unions will be involved. It will he seen that the men are disobeying what Chief Judge Dethridge laid down as a condition precedent to a 44-hour week. They not only will not allow their own men to work, but they threaten to force others out of employment. Yet not a Labour leader has the courage to say that this policy, which leads to the sending of work outside Australia, is one of the most potent causes of unemployment, and that it is time a definite stand was taken in regard to it. The New South Wales Railway Commissioners decided on the construction of steel cars mainly as a result of the lessons that were taught by a number of disastrous collisions, ' which showed that wooden cars telescoped easily and caused casualties, a result which could be partially eliminated by the use of steel cars. The conversion of the present stock of wood cars to steel cars has been delayed by the strike, thus increasing the danger to the travelling public in New South Wales. Not merely is employment being interfered with, but the lives, the health and the welfare of travellers are jeopardized because these men will not accept conditions that are generally recognized to be necessary to industry. The Labour delegates who accompanied the industrial mission which visited the United States of America advocated on their return a system of payment by results. Yet the unions will not agree to it, and the leaders of the Labour party dare not raise a voice in protest.","4","12","17"

"Before the luncheon adjournment I dealt with the failure of the official leaders of Labour to do their duty to the workers of Australia by showing them clearly that the only practicable means whereby a permanent improvement in their conditions, particularly in regard to hours, can be achieved is by increase'd production. What is true of the question of hours is equally true with regard to strikes. Since we have compulsory arbitration, both Federal and State, a strike is surely an anachronism. Compulsory arbitration surely means that the two parties to a dispute place their case before an impartial tribunal, which determines the issue, and the finding or award of that impartial tribunal should be accepted without quibble and be binding on both parties. But we find that, despite this system of compulsory arbitration, there is a continual series of strikes.","20"

"Several honorable members interjecting -","3","4","12","17"
"It is obvious that the Government is in sore straits, otherwise it would not attempt to apply the 'gag' when a motion of censure is before the House. Honorable members who have not yet spoken to the motion, but desire to do so, will now be prevented from speaking, notwithstanding that they have gone to some trouble to collect data to place before honorable members. Realizing that honorable members on this side have presented facts to the House, and that further facts are in the possession of honorable members who have not yet spoken, the Government is endeavouring to suppress them by applying the ' gag.' Honorable members on the other side have evaded the real issue ; they have consistently refrained from offering any suggestion to alleviate the distress caused by unemployment in Australia. At the last moment the Treasurer has risen in an effort to divert attention from the real issue by raising the question of arbitration. Seeing that the Government is supported by free traders, foreign importers, ex-strikers, and ' shandy-gaff ' protectionists, it is useless to expect from it a policy which will advance Australia's interests. Following the Prime Minister's callous references to the unemployed, honorable members behind him slandered the workers of Australia, thus injuring Australia in the eyes of other nations. Last of all we have the Treasurer attempting to deliver a lecture on the duties of Australian industrialists, and advocating piece-work. I wish the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Hill) was present to hear what I am about to say regarding piece-work in the department under his control. The construction of a railway in the far north was recently commenced. As a result of a vote of workmen it was decided to adopt the principle of piece-work. They entered into an agreement with the department for the construction of certain earthworks. Expenditure 1 amounting, in some instances, to as much as £300 dr £500, was incurred in the purchase of the necessary plant; but as soon as the Government found itself in financial difficulties, the Minister repudiated the whole of those contracts. It is easy enough for Ministers to preach doctrines in which they do not believe; but they find it difficult to put them into practice. Apparently, what is a vice in the workers is a virtue in members of the Government. If that is to be the spirit in which the Government will meet the workers at the suggested peace conference, all I can say is, ' God help the workers.' The Government appears to take a delight in injuring the workers on every possible occasion. Recently it amended the Navigation Act, making it no longer necessary for competent seamen and officers to be employed on vessels of under 50 tons weight. In the most dangerous waters of Australia the only safeguard to the lives of travellers was removed. In its desire to obtain sweated native labour at 3s. a week, the Government dispensed with the services of certificated masters. Yet it asks the industrialists of Australia to attend a peace conference. What can be expected from a government which on every possible occasion stabs the workers in the hack? The whole of the defence offered by honorable members opposite has been hyprocritical. The Treasurer has spoken about finance. Was there ever a more hopeless bungle than we have at present with the Treasurer not only unable to forecast his revenue but also quite unable to approximate his expenditure to his revenue? Parliament has passed bills authorizing the construction of urgent railways and other works, and provision has been made in loan bills for the cost of these works, but the Treasurer,' unable to approximate his expenditure to his estimated revenue, cannot find the money for them. The works thus suspended would have employed thousands of men not in localities where migrants would have congregated but in portions of Australia requiring development. If carried out they would have 'increased Australia's production, and thus have provided more avenues for employment. But the bungling methods of the Treasurer have tied them up. I have information in my possession that would give the lie to the deliberate misquotations of honorable members on the Ministerial side of the chamber. The fact remains that there are 100,000 men unemployed in Australia to-day, and when we realize how many persons are dependent on those who are out of work, the present state of affairs is appallingly tragic. Yet the Prime Minister declares that it is not the concern of the Commonwealth Government. If I had the time I could make that argument look ridiculous and so with all the other arguments used by the right honorable gentleman in dealing with this motion. I could show that lack of administrative ability and the refusal to provide adequate protection for our secondary industries, and adequate means - transport and other - for the promotion of primary industries, are the direct cause of the existing unemployment. I know that the motion will not be carried, and that the gag awaits those who want to speak to it; but it will go down in history that the Bruce-Page Ministry was the most callous that ever controlled the Commonwealth.","17"
"The interjection of the honorable member reminds me that the Government has been effectively criticized by all speakers from this side of the House. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) stated the case for the censure motion, and his remarks were endorsed by the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin). The statistics with regard to unemployment quoted by the Prime Minister and Government supporters have been proved to be inaccurate. If the figures relating to the adverse balance of trade were not ' cooked ' they were, at all events, handled very awkwardly. As the position has been . fully stated by other honorable members on this side, no good purpose would be served by my covering the same ground. The honorable member for Gwydir (Mr. Abbott) had something to say about child endowment and national insurance, which, we have been assured, is the settled policy of the Government. Both national insurance and child endowment have been features of Labour policies for many years, and since they have now been adopted by the Government, it is obvious that the Labour party must always have been on sound lines. Had the proposals of the Government with regard to both those questions been given effect, the situation to-day might not have been so serious as it is. Nothing, however, has been done to deal with the present industrial depression. All members of this Parliament owe a duty to humanity. I could not help feeling, when the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster) was speaking, that the people who are suffering most are not receiving that consideration which they are entitled to expect. I am well acquainted with the career of the honorable member for Wakefield, and I am familiar with the tenets of his early political faith. I do not wish to hand out ' sob' stuff, as suggested by the honorable member for Gwydir, but I wish to secure justice for those who are suffering at the moment. It is the right of the unemployed to have the opportunity to work. The position in Adelaide is little short of desperate, and I question if the State Government can do much to relieve the situation there. The Leader of the Opposition in the State Parliament (Mr. Hill) made certain proposals recently, but the Premier of that State (Mr. Butler) denied that any of the suggestions could be given effect to. While there is this conflict of opinion between the two leaders, the position of the unemployed in that city has become extremely acute. The suggestion was made that the unemployed should take drastic action, even to the extent of breaking a few windows. I strongly objected to such tactics, and pointed out that the men's position would be worse than ever, because they would be gaoled by the police.","17"
