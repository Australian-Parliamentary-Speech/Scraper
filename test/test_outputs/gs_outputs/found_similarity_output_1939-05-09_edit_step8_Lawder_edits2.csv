"If those statements mean anything at all they mean that the disaster that we thought to be inevitable last September has only been postponed. It appears to be quite certain that vested interests in the different countries of the world intend to force the workers of all .nations to go to war. I wish to make it quite clear that personally I am opposed to all forms of force, but I think it is high time that what took place prior to and at Munich should be revealed to the general public. The Lyons Government adopted a ' hush-hush ' policy, and did everything possible to prevent honorable members from discussing these subjects. The Menzies Government, we should remember, consists of practically the same team with a new captain. Apparently it expects U9 to accept as gospel everything that it states and everything that appears in the newspapers. Herr Hitler, in his last speech, declared that much of the enmity that existed throughout the world to-day was due to press propaganda. It is obvious to me that the news wÂ« get in the press is not all the news, but only what the editors choose to publish. The totalitarian states have been constituted with one objective, namely, to stage a war against Russia. I maintain that what takes place in Russia is the concern of the Russians, just as what takes place in Australia is the concern of the Australians, and what takes place in France and England is the concern of Frenchmen and Englishmen respectively. The immediate concern of the dictatorships when they were established was to create work for the vast army of unemployed who were walking the streets, an army which if it had continued to be unemployed, must have become a grave danger to the existing order. The first objective of the dictatorships was to stave off the threatened revolution. Then the totalitarian states were to be aimed, and the second objective was to be an attack upon the Russian Government. The third objective was the making of millions of pounds by the armament ring, which is part and parcel of the financial ring that controls the destinies of the world to-day. A great change has come over the European scene. Austria was handed over to Germany without a blow being struck. Czechoslovakia was seized by Germany,* notwithstanding the fact that Czechoslovakia had expended over Â£80,000,000 on armaments, and that its people were armed to the teeth, and prepared to die in defence of their country. In spite of the existence of alliances, no one came to the assistance of that country, and it had to bow to the will of Germany. Then it was Poland's turn, and immediately Germany formulated demands against that country. This time, however, there was a different story to tell. Great Britain and France backed the independence of Poland. It seemed that Hitler, because of the assistance he had given to Franco in Spain, was likely to receive great favours from that gentleman. It is proposed that the territory of Ceuta in North Africa might he handed over to Germany, and if that were done it is possible that Britain's vital line of communication with the East would be threatened, if not severed. Another fly in the ointment was that Hitler had broken with the old, conservative methods of finance, and had embarked upon a policy of internal credits, something which was opposed to the interests of the international financial ring. Moreover, Hitler had inherited the idea of carrying out the old Bismarck plan of expansion to the south-east through the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey, Persia, and on to India. Thus the interests, and even the very existence, of the British Empire might be threatened. There followed an understanding between Britain, France and Poland. But where was Russia in all this? I am not speaking as a Communist, or as one holding a brief for Russia, but as one who is opposed to war. Russia has made no move because Russia realizes that if Poland falls, the attack on Russia will not be far off. We, as individuals, are small pawns in the game of international politics. In this world more consideration is given to wealth than to human life. If war is staved off for ever, as I hope it will be, then the stand taken by the Chamberlain Government will go down in history as one of the greatest events that has. ever occurred in the history of the world. All Australians desire to live at peace with the rest of the world, so that this country may work out its own destiny. It is our fervent hope to continue to make Australia a country worth living in, a country worthy of its place as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.","17"

"On the 5th May, the honorable member for Barton (Mr. Lane) asked whether a company, which had issued invitations to witness a demonstration of a small pilot plant for the extraction of oil from coal at Annandale, New South Wales, on Monday, the 8th. May, had requested a grant of Â£15,000 from the Commonwealth to assist to put its plant into operation? I am now in a position to inform the honorable member that this company, Phoenix Oil Extractors (Proprietary) Limited, of 117 Pittstreet, Sydney, asked for a free grant of up to Â£15,000 for the purpose of erecting a standard commercial unit of medium capacity. The company was informed that the whole question of the extent to which the Government should assist private enterprise in matters of this kind was recently reported upon by the Commonwealth Standing Committee on Liquid Fuels. The committee expressed the view that the Government should not advance money for the proving of any particular type of retort or process. This was regarded essentially as the responsibility of the designers or patentees, who would normally be rewarded according to the merits of their propositions through the usual commercial channels. In view of these circumstances the application was refused.","17"
