"Order! I assure honourable members that I intend to celebrate the tranquility of the House today. The facts are that only 12 questions have been asked but I think everyone will agree that three of the questions were very pertinent and necessitated long answers. I do not think anybody would begrudge detailed answers being given in regard to the floods in Queensland and northern New South Wales. I think the question asked of the Minister for Labour necessitated a long answer to enlighten the House as to what hap ape ned. I appeal to Ministers to be as brief as possible when they answer questions in future because I would hope to attain at least 16 questions a day. The question now being answered is only the twelfth today. The appeal by the Leader of the Opposition is simply a matter for the Prime Minister."
"I wish to inform the House that the following members have been nominated as members of the Select Committee on Road Safety: Mr Cohen, Mr Innes, Dr Klugman and Mr McKenzie have been nominated by the Prime Minister; Mr Fox and  Mr Hamer have been nominated by the Leader of the Opposition; and Mr Katter has been nominated by the Leader of the Australian Country Party."
"Third Reading"
"Order! There is no obligation for the honorable member to table the document."
"Mr Dunstan voted against Dartmouth Dam 4 years ago."
"(The document read as follows) - 1.I am a member of the Australian Society of Accountants, the person who carried out the detailed work on the audits of C. J. Hurford & Co., Chartered Accountants, under the supervision of Mr Hurford and others, and the person mentioned by Hr Hall, M.P., in his statement in the South Australian Parliament on 26 February 1974. I associate myself completely with Mr Hurford 's statement concerning Mr Hall's baseless attack on us. 2.In his statement about the audit of the Storemen and Packers' Union, South Australian Branch, Mr Hall attributed to me (a) that I had indicated that there was no misappropriation and that debts were due to the overspending of union funds, (b) that I had given the advice 'You can't call the police in', but that I had retracted this and had used the words to Mr Jack Petrie, Federal Secretary of the Storemen and Packers' Union, 'There's no doubt someone is tickling the peter and we both know who it is', and (c) that later I had advised that the former secretary of the South Australian Branch of the Union should be dealt with severely but this should be done without police intervention. These statements of Mr Hall 's are absolutely false and I deny them completely. 3.The facts are that (i) I attended a meeting of the Branch Management Committee in January 1973 by invitation, (ii) At no time did I give advice as to whether or not there had been a misappropriation because I had insufficient evidence and could only state what is public knowledge in the published auditors' reports, (iii) My only intervention related to the tendering of advice concerning the rules of the branch which had been registered under the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Act and this advice did on one occasion in the meeting result in the rewording of a resolution, (iv) I have verified these facts by examining the Minutes of the Branch and my own record of what took place at the Branch Committee Meeting written the day after the meeting. 4. Mr Hall made no attempt to check the facts with me. Because he will not repeat his charges outside the Parliament where their truthfulness can be tested in the Courts, he has caused me personal damage in a cowardly way for his own base political motives.  J.H. DOYLE 11 March 1974."
