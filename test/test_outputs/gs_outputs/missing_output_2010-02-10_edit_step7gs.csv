"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today, I introduce a bill that will amend the Commonwealth’s consumer credit legislation to ensure an effective referral of power from the states to the Commonwealth in relation to consumer credit. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, last year the government enacted legislation to implement phase 1 of the National Consumer Credit Reform Package, delivering on the government’s commitment to modernise Australia’s consumer credit laws. This credit reform package will, for the first time in Australia, provide a single, standard, national regime for the regulation of consumer credit replacing the state based regime, which operates inconsistently across the eight jurisdictions. This landmark reform has only been possible through the strong commitment by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments working in a spirit of cooperation to realise the COAG reform vision for a single, uniform national credit law. This is evidenced by the signing of the Intergovernmental Agreement for National Credit Law by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments in December last year and a commitment by all governments to commence the national credit law at the same time later this year. As the Commonwealth’s legislative powers are not sufficient to enact a nationally comprehensive regulatory framework for consumer credit, it is therefore necessary for the states to refer their powers to the Commonwealth under section 51 of the Constitution by passing the relevant referral legislation in their respective parliaments. Tasmania has passed the Credit (Commonwealth Powers) Bill 2009. Following the enactment of the referral bills, the states will be able to repeal their state laws in time for the commencement of the national credit legislation on 1 July 2010. In December last year, the Commonwealth and state governments agreed to modify the referral bills by inserting ‘carve out’ provisions, which provide that certain subject matters, such as State taxation, are excluded from the referral bill. This bill amends the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, the ‘credit act’, to recognise certain exclusions to the scope of the amendment power in the referral bill and to enable an effective reference of state power to be made either with or without any exclusions to that power. This ensures that the state reference legislation with no limitations and state reference legislation with the added protection of the exclusions to the reference of their powers are equally effective. The amendments in this bill will also allow the states to refer their regulatory powers in relation to consumer credit by ‘adopting’ the Commonwealth’s legislation. This will ensure the constitutional soundness of the referral of consumer credit powers. Following the Commonwealth’s enactment of this bill, the states wishing to refer powers using the adoption approach will be able to do so with their referral bills. Importantly, the scope and effectiveness of the national credit protection regime will not be affected by any such variation to the referral or whether states refer power or adopt the national credit legislation. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash ) adjourned."
"This suite of bills should really be renamed. It should be renamed ‘Labor’s great big new tax on everything’. I think that many of my colleagues on the Labor side of the House are probably feeling quite some disquiet at the moment as to whether or not they have got it right. I think there is increasing evidence to indicate that they have not got it right, but there is certainly increasing evidence that the disquiet in the Australian community is certainly manifesting itself very significantly as people are beginning to understand and to realise that everything is going to go up in price, and they are beginning to be very wary about the fact that the government cannot explain what kinds of price rises there might be or where they might be across the community or across the economy, and I think that it is incumbent upon the government to accurately explain those prices or withdraw the bills, basically. So far, after several months of this bill being available for scrutiny, the government have not been able to give the assurances and comfort to the Australian people that they deserve. That was not the case back in 1997-98 when the former Howard government undertook the implementation of a new tax system in Australia, and part of that, of course, was the GST. That was massively complicated, of course; at that stage, the Howard government was able to explain to the Australian community the whys and wherefores of the GST, the most intricate detail of how it would work and why it would be of benefit to our country. Unfortunately, the Rudd government has, basically, arrogantly decided that it has the numbers and the support, and it will just do what it wants to do; it will not prepare itself to explain this legislation to the Australian public and it will treat them with contempt. Well, there is a new political landscape, and the new political landscape is that the Australian community is, in fact, very uneasy about a big new tax on everything and the way it is to be implemented. People do not understand the way it is going to be implemented. It is very complex. And, of course, Australia does not want to be ahead of the rest of the world in what it is going to do. The government faces the situation where, one day, perhaps in many years to come, there is likely to be an ETS-style system across the world—one day, in many years to come. But ‘one day’ is not ‘today’, and the Australian people should not see our country’s economy damaged by something where Australia is moving itself way ahead of the rest of the world. The world generally takes its lead from places like the United States of America, and it is very clear now that the US in fact will not be proceeding in the direction of an ETS at this stage or any time soon. And the problem with Australia proceeding now is that, as much as some people in the community would say, ‘This is a fine and ideal thing to do,’ it damages our economy vis-a-vis the economies in the rest of the world. Why would we want to be putting Australians out of work because the rest of the world will not follow higher ideals? Why would that be? The answer is that we should not be. So we should be looking for alternatives to cut carbon pollution and implement those alternatives. This debate is not about whether the world is warming or cooling; it is not about whether there are climate sceptics or climate deniers; it is not about that at all. What it is about is the conservation and sustainability of our world. Those who have been travelling overseas to Asia, Europe and some parts of the United States and who have seen what the air quality is like there are just horrified. Say you go to Beijing: the aircraft pulls out from the terminal and by the time you get to the runway you cannot see the terminal. That cannot be good for our world. It cannot be good for our health. And whether that pollution, the increase in particulates in the atmosphere and in parts per million of CO2, contributes to global warming or not, we do not need to have that debate. We know that pollution is bad. We know that we have got to conserve our planet’s resources. We know that we have got to have a sustainable future. We know that we cannot just go on burning up all of our resources. That is why moving to green energy is very important. There is such a range of green energy technologies available these days, and the range is increasing day by day. There are the standard things like solar and wind that we all know about, but there are also geothermal and tidal power. High altitude wind is emerging as a technology. You have got the production of ethanol from non-food-producing plants and non-arable land. There is huge investment going into genetically modifying crops so that the particular stock that is grown produces the best ratio of ethanol per hectare of crop but so that the crops are not growing on arable land and so taking away from food production. It is wonderful technology that is emerging. And it is interesting that many of the large oil companies are investing in that technology because they know that we have got to have a sustainable future. And, of course, the energy input into that process is sunlight, which is energy free from the sun, as it is, effectively, for solar and wind. It is terrific that the world is investing in these technologies. Recently I was in the United States talking to a number of major global companies at their national headquarters, and it surprised me that they are about two years ahead of the legislature in the United States. The companies themselves had decided that they had to take responsible decisions on conservation and sustaining our planet’s future. That is a great thing. Indeed, one of the company’s world headquarters that I visited was Google. You might ask, ‘How could Google be in the green space?’ But they are a very significant operation looking at how they use their resources to be in the green space and to save energy. It does not involve just the company itself; it is also the technologies they are developing for all of the people who use Google. That would indicate that the opposition’s policy—that is, to have an incentive program—in fact really can work, rather than a penalty program which the government is proposing, a big tax. It stands in stark contrast with the government’s program under which electricity prices are likely to rise by a projected 62 per cent. Under the opposition’s program, which will achieve the same reduction in CO2, there will be no rise in electricity prices. Surely the government should investigate and agree with the opposition, ‘Hey, you probably have some good ideas there; we will implement those.’ But, no, that has not happened. Instead, we get left with questions about just how much Mr Rudd’s tax will really cost Australians and Australian businesses. By how much will a birthday cake increase in price? How much will it cost a farmer? By how much will a pensioner’s heating and cooling bills increase? How much will it cost a single mum or the little Aussie battler living in North Queensland? I will tell you what it will cost, Mr Deputy Speaker: it will cost the jobs of hardworking Australians; it will cost the jobs of thousands of miners, plant operators, port operators, rail workers and mine employees who live in my electorate. Under the Rudd ETS, the Yabulu nickel refinery, the Korea Zinc refinery and the Xstrata copper refinery in my electorate would be under serious threat. Why would the government bring this uncertainty on hardworking Australians? Why would they say, ‘Well, it is just too bad, they are going to have to lose their jobs,’ because of this high and mighty principle? The parliament has to have a heart. We have to think about those families and we have to think about alternatives so that we do not lose those jobs. That is why the opposition has worked so very hard to put up a completely different set of values from that which the government has put up. Why the government just doggedly sticks to something that is a dog, I simply do not know. The government’s claim that households will be compensated misses the point. Families and businesses will still have to wear the costs no matter what. All this piece of legislation does is to create yet another layer of bureaucracy and bureaucratic red tape at a time when the government is making a poor attempt to reduce that bureaucracy and red tape. On Lateline last year Julia Gillard refused seven times to put a figure on the real cost of Labor’s ETS for Australian families. Surely that makes us all suspicious. Why is that? Is it because it is going to cost Australian families $1,100 a year or because the government is too incompetent or arrogant to figure this out for itself? Kevin Rudd has claimed that action on climate change can only mean his tax plan. This is misleading, dishonest and political trickery of the worst kind, but we have come to expect this kind of behaviour. How many Australians really understand the government’s ETS? I do not know very many at all in my constituency. I think that Labor MPs may well be in the same boat. As Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating once famously said: ‘If you don’t understand it, don’t vote for it. If you do understand it, you’d definitely never vote for it’. I think he fairly succinctly summed up the particular suite of bill we have before the parliament today. The other aspect of the ETS that worries me is the potential to scare off hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in the North Queensland region. After Labor’s ETS was defeated last year, Western Australian mining company Hancock Prospecting and the second-largest steelmaker in Japan, JFE Steel Corporation, both announced huge investments in the Queensland coal industry. The $100 million feasibility study is just the tip of the iceberg. The announcement by Hancock Prospecting could potentially be worth tens of billions of dollars to the northern economy over the next few decades. Very recently, Mineralogy announced a huge new project in Queensland, and that is just wonderful news, but this ETS has the potential to scare off those investors. In stark contrast, the coalition has a viable alternative scheme to an ETS that will not cost jobs in my electorate, or any other electorate for that matter. It will still reduce pollution by the same amount as the Labor ETS. No solution is cost free, but there has to be a better way than to slug families and businesses with a $120 billion to $140 billion great big new tax on families and businesses as is proposed in these bills before us today. Direct action based on incentives and cooperation, which is what the opposition believes in—not punishing families—is the way to go. Over the forward estimates the coalition’s policy will cost $3.2 billion. Compare that with the government’s ETS over the same period costing $40 billion. Unlike the government’s emissions trading scheme, the coalition is not forcing a great big new tax on all Australians. In fact, the coalition’s policy will not be funded through any new taxes or increased taxes and it will protect Australian jobs through government and industry cooperation. The coalition’s plan to reduce carbon pollution will entail cleaning up the power stations that account for almost half the emissions in Australia by encouraging the use of other green energy apart from solar, wind and tidal—in particular, geothermal and natural gas—for the production of electricity. I am pleased to say that the $50 million fund with matching funding for the sector will allow testing to ensure algal energy, being pioneered at James Cook University in Townsville, is effective in reducing CO2 emissions and does not impact on food production. Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to Minister Combet’s comments in this House in the past three days. On 2 February in this House Minister Combet, who is the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change, said:"
"Rubbish! Even your own colleague Senator Boyce, who crossed the floor last time to support our ETS, said that as a manufacturer she knew that early adopters of new technologies and new approaches were always the winners in business, and that applies to Tomago Aluminium as well. But I thank the member for Paterson, because it gives me the opportunity to praise the work of the CEO of Tomago Aluminium, Mr Andre Martel, who recently announced that he will be returning to Canada, with a new CEO to be appointed. I would like to put on the record what a pleasure it has been working with Andrew Martel and his organisation and assisting their access to our ministers so that their needs and their issues are well understood. I recall, too, a business dinner some years ago at which someone questioned the reality of climate change. It was Andre Martel who cautioned his colleagues then that they ignored climate change at their peril—that it was significant for their businesses and that they should include it as an important factor in their strategic plans, just as Tomago Aluminium has done for some time. I wish Andre Martel continuing success and thank him for the professional relationship we established. I say to the member for Paterson: the coalition of old is clearly back. Do not let facts get in the way of your great big scaremongering and sledging campaign. Member for Paterson, Tony Abbott’s great big con job on climate change and your great big rant and attack on me and my hardworking colleagues just does not cut it—with me or with the people of Newcastle and the Hunter, who understand the importance of responding to climate change, who know that an emissions trading scheme is the most effective way to assist polluters to cut emissions, to compensate working families for any cost transfers and to give certainty to business to invest in the clean energy economy for the future. So, Member for Paterson, apparently your leader believes climate change is just crap—and from your speech yesterday it seems that you are up to your eyeballs in peddling exactly that. In contrast to the opposition, the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme makes polluters pay for their pollution and thereby encourages them to invest in cleaner technologies. In fact, almost every other developed nation envisages some form of carbon price as a key plank of its policy. None currently relies, as does the opposition, solely on direct action. In particular, the European Union has an ETS that will cover about 45 per cent of emissions but uses regulation to drive emissions down in the transport and agriculture sectors. Japan has also proposed a cap-and-trade scheme or a carbon levy to meet a promised 25 per cent emissions reduction by 2020. Over 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States and New Zealand, either have introduced or are preparing a CPRS. The Rudd government’s market based scheme is the most cost-effective way of reducing emissions. I must say that when we are talking about hypocrisy there is some in the coalition not supporting a market based approach, one that gives incentives to business to set that market itself within a limited cap. I find that remarkable. Market based schemes are widely recognised as the best way to reduce carbon pollution. John Howard, Malcolm Turnbull, Joe Hockey—most of the mainstream members of the Liberal Party have all supported that approach. The government’s responsible approach is based on the global scientific consensus, including the work of our own scientists from the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology. Climate change action is in the nation’s interest. As one of the hottest and driest countries on earth, our environment and our economy potentially will be hardest and fastest hit. We have heard lots about the impact on household costs. The modelling shows about a one per cent increase, but our compensation plan—one which has been fully costed and modelled—means that 92 per cent of all households will receive assistance. The difference between the Rudd government and the opposition on climate change is simple. Our plan caps and reduces Australia’s carbon pollution for the first time ever. Abbott’s plan does not reduce pollution; in fact, taxpayers will be slugged with a $10 billion bill to see emissions grow, apparently, by 13 per cent by 2020. Our plan makes polluters pay for their carbon pollution while offering them assistance to manage that. Abbott’s plan lets polluters off scot-free while households pick up the bill. Our plan takes the money raised from the polluters and reallocates it as cash assistance to working families. Abbott’s plan does not deliver a single dollar in assistance to working families. If coalition history is anything to go by, I can see that direct action plan rolled out only to the electorates that they need to win in an election. We remember their history with the Natural Heritage Trust and the Regional Partnerships. Those were rorted; they were only about direct action where they needed to buy votes. We have taken direct action. We have taken early action. We are providing up to $200 million in 2009-10 through the Climate Change Action Fund to help industries, small business, community groups, workers and communities prepare for the introduction of the CPRS. This includes up to $20 million for business information packages, up to $100 million on energy efficiency strategies and up to $80 million on capital investment grants for businesses and community organisations. Mr Abbott’s climate con job contains no such plan to assist community groups or households. Mr Abbott’s climate con job costs more, does less and is unfunded. Our policy is a policy that works. It makes polluters pay but still provides them support, and it helps working families. It provides businesses certainty so that they will invest in clean energy alternatives. It caps and reduces Australia’s carbon pollution for the first time ever. Abbott’s plan does not reduce pollution and it slugs taxpayers. Our plan makes those polluters pay; his plan lets them off scot-free. Our plan takes the money raised from the polluters and transfers it into cash assistance for working families; Abbott’s plan does not deliver a single dollar in assistance to working families. Those are the differences. It is time to embrace change and be part of the climate change solution. Climate change is not ‘crap’, Tony Abbott, and effective management of climate change could never happen under the coalition’s great big con job. I commend these bills to the House."

"The member for Bowman then left the chamber. —This government is proud of its record of more than 200,000 computers in Australian secondary schools; proud of the fact that we have the biggest school modernisation program underway in Australia’s history; and proud of the fact that we are undertaking fundamental reforms in the quality of education through the My School website and the investment in disadvantaged schools. This is a record of achievement in education. When the Leader of the Opposition stands up and speaks about integrity of commitments, I have one set of words for him: rock solid, solid gold guarantee—the absolute ‘rock solid’, ‘ironclad’ commitment that he gave to the Australian people on his Medicare safety net undertaking. The Leader of the Opposition stands up and speaks of integrity, but ‘rock solid, ironclad, absolute commitment’ were his words on the eve of the 2004 election when he said he would not touch the Medicare safety net, would not touch the thresholds, and then four months later upped the thresholds both for low-income earners and for middle-income earners. Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he raises and continues to raise questions of integrity and commitment here, one by one we will go through what happened under his period as health minister, one by one we will go through his record in terms of the Medicare safety net—that rock solid, ironclad commitment that he gave to the Australian people—and, beyond that, we will look very carefully at what the Leader of the Opposition had to say as he sought to weasel his way out of the fact that he ripped $1 billion out of Australia’s public hospital system. The Leader of the Opposition was health minister for four years and what he came out and said was, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me; in fact, it is just that the increase in expenditure on health slowed a little bit.’ I can say to the Leader of the Opposition that we are going to peel back those numbers day by day and look at precisely what he did in the period 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007—the period when he was health minister—so proud he is of his achievements in this respect. We welcome a debate on the record of his achievement in health against the record of achievement of this government in health. We welcome a debate on the record of this government in education against the record of those opposite on education. Every time the Leader of the Opposition opens his mouth, ‘Absolute, rock solid ironclad commitments,’ we will be listening very carefully to the integrity of his words, as we watched with great disappointment the honouring of those commitments by him in the past."

"Mr Lynas said that Sudan behaved at the talks as a puppet of China, ‘one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of having to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and then left its proxies to savage it in public’. Mr Lynas said that at late night meetings, as the heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors, Barack Obama was present for hours, with Gordon Brown, other Prime Ministers including the Danish Prime Minister who chaired the talks, and the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. Only about 50 or 60 people were present in the room. The Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, did not attend the meetings personally, instead sending a second-tier foreign ministry official to sit opposite Obama. Mr Lynas said the diplomatic snub was obvious and brutal, as were the practical consequences, and stated:"
"Mr Lynas says it was China’s representative who insisted that industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80 per cent cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. ‘Why can’t we even mention our own targets?’ asked Angela Merkel. Brazil’s representative also pointed out that this position was illogical—why should rich countries not announce this unilateral cut? But the Chinese delegate blocked it. Mark Lynas says this is because China did not want the talks to succeed and wanted the rich countries to get the blame for Copenhagen’s lack of ambition. He said:"
"… his mandate had been to protect India’s right for fast economic growth, and listed killing off binding targets for reducing emissions as a key victory for his country. “We can be satisfied that we were able to get our way on this issue [targets],” Mr Ramesh said. Mr Ramesh later told a news conference that a bloc of key emerging economies - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - had worked effectively to protect the rights of the developing world."
"I want to make my contribution to the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010 by dealing with a number of unrelated issues of relevance to my electorate. I have not spoken too often about legal matters in the parliament, but today I want to address serious concerns about the administration of justice, particularly the treatment of one my constituents, Mr Gavin Wright, who was formerly of Mackay but is now based in my electorate. Mr Wright has a range of concerns about his treatment by the legal system, particularly regarding the performance of his solicitor, Mr Robert Cochrane. Mr Wright was referred to Robert Cochrane, the then principal of Hope Lawyers, a firm now bankrupt, to deal with family law matters following his family breakdown. Mr Wright alleges that Mr Cochrane did not handle his case in a competent, honest or professional manner, and that, as a result, his case was never properly presented to the courts. I know many honourable members may have heard from people who are dissatisfied with the outcome of a court case but in this instance Mr Wright’s arguments are very compelling. I perused some of the documents in Mr Wright’s possession, and I have to say that I am also deeply disturbed about the management of his case and the failure of the legal system to address what has happened. The allegations made by Mr Wright, which are supported by the documents, include that Mr Cochrane failed to appear in court on 6 April 2006 as required, even though it seems he charged Mr Wright for the appearance. The Federal Magistrates Court made an order which required action from Mr Wright before 7 June 2006; however, Mr Wright was only provided with a copy of the order on 9 June 2006—two days later—making it completely impossible for him to respond to the court’s requirements. Mr Cochrane informed the Federal Magistrates Court on 30 May 2006 through a barrister that Mr Wright could not proceed with the case because funds were not available, when in fact Mr Wright had paid all of the required funds. There were adequate funds available to meet all of the costs that were required by the court. On 22 November 2006, in quite an extraordinary case, the Federal Magistrates Court ordered that Mr Cochrane, the solicitor who was representing Mr Wright, be made a second respondent in the matter and ordered all costs against Mr Cochrane because of his incompetence in managing the case. We have an extraordinary case where even the magistrate came to the view that this guy was so incompetent that he made him a respondent to the case and then ordered all the costs against him. The costs have never been paid and Hope Lawyers went into receivership. It does not end there. Mr Wright complained to the Legal Services Commission about Mr Cochrane. On 28 February 2008, the Legal Services Commission wrote to Mr Wright advising that the commissioner had filed a discipline action with the Legal Practice Tribunal against Mr Cochrane. In all, some 15 charges were laid against Mr Cochrane, only two of which involve Mr Wright. Eleven of the charges concerned non-compliance with the notices from the Legal Services Commission or the Queensland Law Society. The others involved misleading the Federal Magistrates Court, contempt of the Family Court of Australia, failure to return trust account monies within 14 days of being required to do so and engaging in legal practice without a practising certificate. Whilst all of these charges related to quite grave events, the actions taken by the Legal Services Commission were more in relation to technical matters such as failing to comply with notices issued to Mr Cochrane to respond to requests for information rather than dealing with the substantial allegations of misconduct against Mr Cochrane. Consequently, most of the serious allegations against him have not even been assessed by the Legal Practice Tribunal. In view of the grave nature of the charges against Mr Cochrane, including the 15 specific charges arising out of his general conduct between 5 August 2005 and 13 December 2007, the penalties which were imposed on Mr Cochrane seem to me to have been manifestly inadequate. The penalties involved a public reprimand; a fine of $7,500, which he had a year to pay; $2,500 worth of costs; being restricted to a practising certificate for three years which required him to practise under supervision; and some mentoring requirements. In view of the scale of this misconduct, it seems to me that those penalties were manifestly inadequate. If you read the judgment by the tribunal, all the way through it seems to be trying to find excuses for Mr Cochrane and his behaviour, pointing out in one instance in relation to my constituent’s concerns:"
"and need to be moved, but the numbers in Queensland and New South Wales are becoming seriously depleted. Many people say that this is because of a loss of habitat, and that is certainly a factor. Farmers tend to get the blame for that, although I think that is unfair because a lot of the habitat is, in fact, destroyed for urban development. The areas where koalas live are also the areas where people like to live and so the koalas’ territory is often invaded for urban development. But it is possible, as I mentioned from my own personal example, for koalas and urban populations to cohabit. There are risks—for example, motor vehicles on the road. Also, domestic dogs can attack koalas. Even seemingly pleasant little pets, if they have a koala crossing their yard, will see it as invading their territory. While koalas carry a nasty scratch, a dog will often win the fight. There are issues, but the biggest concern affecting the New South Wales and Queensland koala population is the onset of a range of new diseases which threaten the entire population. There are some colonies where there are few breeding animals left, and science does not really understand these diseases. There is a need to do a lot more research on trying to find a way to address the diseases and establish and preserve disease-free colonies so that the populations of koalas in Queensland and New South Wales can be at sustainable levels. Ms Carolyn Beaton, who has been a koala advocate for many years, has been advocating the establishment of a sanctuary in the Noosa area for koalas. The iconic Noosa National Park is thought to have as few as 10 or a dozen koalas left. She would like to see that population enhanced or in fact see new sanctuaries established in the region to make sure that the Sunshine Coast koala population is maintained and preserved. She has sought funding for a Noosa koala sanctuary education and research centre. She has the cooperation of a number of the other wildlife establishments in the region, and I think it would be a very sensible move to establish a research centre for koalas in the Sunshine Coast area. Its priority needs to be to address disease issues to make sure that we do not—as with the Tasmanian devils—run the risk of having the population lost not because of the intervention of man but because of the advent of a disease that we do not seem to be able to effectively combat. I wrote to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts about this issue. He tells me:"
"So it is fairly unequivocal. We had a strong endorsement by the Labor candidate at the time, the coalition candidate at the time also expressed strong support for the establishment of childcare services in Yarram but, unfortunately for the community, precious little has happened in the subsequent months which have passed. Since the election and the change of government, there has been a lot more talk in the community about the need to establish such a service, but here we are almost three years later and the issue of Yarram childcare services has not been resolved and I am certain that it will be an important election issue again for the local community as we move forward in 2010. I am personally frustrated and disappointed—and I know the community is as well—with the lack of progress, but the community does remain determined to secure such a service in the future, and I will continue to back the Yarram community 100 per cent on this very important local issue. There is a committee in place to investigate a range of issues, including the best location, what sort of operational model will work best, and funding opportunities, and there is strong support in the local community. In fact, I would suggest that support is stronger now than it was 2½ years ago. Without childcare services, it is very difficult for a small regional centre to secure professional services and professional people in a whole range of industries. Yarram is currently experiencing quite a bit of difficulty in recruiting doctors, and I have no doubt that it is going to be easier to attract such professional people in the future if support services such as child care are in place. The provision of appropriate childcare services for Yarram remains an issue that I would like to work in partnership with the federal on to solve in the months ahead. Mr Deputy Speaker, in case you get the feeling that I am being a bit too negative, I would like to give some bouquets to the government in relation to some funding announcements in my electorate which have been very well received. There was a timely announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in May 2008. Given that the Gippsland by-election was in June 2008, it was very timely that the minister announced a funding commitment to the establishment of Cunninghame Quay in Lakes Entrance. I understand that it is a $4.4 million project with the East Gippsland shire receiving $1.6 million for the on-land works—the car park, the paving works and the boardwalk access and bollards. It has been very well received and I am happy to report that construction is underway on the esplanade at Lakes Entrance on this project. Gippsland Ports will also receive $2.8 million for the on-water component of the project. The federal government’s commitment in this regard stands in stark contrast to the state government’s attitude towards the Gippsland Lakes and towards infrastructure on the Gippsland Lakes. It seems to be a situation where the state government has dropped the ball in relation to the future management of the Gippsland Lakes in terms of both its environmental management and its infrastructure. We have seen from the federal government a small commitment of $3 million over three years to the environmental health of the Gippsland Lakes and catchment, and I have written to the minister previously in that regard to encourage him to ensure that funding is ongoing in the longer term. The environmental pressures upon the Gippsland Lakes are growing on an annual basis. For those not familiar with the Gippsland Lakes, it is quite a large waterway—it is the largest inland waterway in the Southern Hemisphere. Even though it is a large lake system, it is actually impacted on by a massive catchment which stretches right throughout the Gippsland-Latrobe Valley region. The environmental characteristics of the lake system have changed dramatically since an artificial entrance was opened more than 100 years ago. The lakes have been the subject of much debate. Graham Harris told me I think eight years ago that CSIRO research showed that the lakes were at an ecological tipping point as an estuarine system heavily impacted on throughout the catchment. Major work is required to address these very significant signs of stress, with algal blooms occurring throughout the lake system on a far too frequent basis. It disturbs me greatly that we do not seem to have a commitment by the state government in particular in terms of the future environmental management of the Gippsland Lakes system. I look back to 2002 when the state government allocated $3.2 million per year over a four-year period to the Gippsland Lakes and Catchment Task Force, primarily directed at reducing the amount of nutrients entering the lake system. Contrast that to four years later, 2006, when the funding was cut by 50 per cent—it was cut to $2 million per year over the future three-year period. Last year the state government made no allocation whatsoever to the Gippsland Lakes task force in terms of ongoing funding. It is an appalling situation. I urge the federal minister and any others with any influence over their state colleagues to see what they can do in terms of raising the pressure on the government in that regard. We have seen the federal government’s announcement of its Caring for our Country program, and they talk a lot about the Great Barrier Reef and making it a national priority. As far as I am concerned, the Gippsland Lakes are the Great Barrier Reef of the south—they are so critically important to the future of my region, to the environmental health of the Ramsar wetlands that are there and to the future of the tourism industry. It is a critical issue for us. In conjunction with the environmental needs not being addressed, the infrastructure needs of the lake system are not being met either. I referred to the project which the federal minister for agriculture announced a couple of years ago. That stands out as a beacon amongst a couple of years of neglect—more than a couple of years of neglect; it goes back decades. The Gippsland Lakes system has become increasingly popular and recreational vessels are getting larger and larger. But the infrastructure in place to accommodate those vessels has not been replaced in the Gippsland Lakes system. You can only wonder how organisations like the East Gippsland Shire Council and Gippsland Ports can continue to stretch a shoestring to try to accommodate the future needs of a very popular lake system. The boating community is demanding improved facilities in terms of jetties and wharves and boat launching ramps, and the infrastructure backlog is getting out of control. Without the state government taking a greater interest and perhaps without the federal government also taking a greater interest, I fear for the future of the tourism industry in the East Gippsland region and the Gippsland Lakes in particular. I would like to end my contribution on a more positive note by referring to the Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club. It is about to host the Victorian state junior and senior titles, in March this year. The Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club is one of those little institutions in regional towns that you take for granted to some extent until you realise just what sort of contribution they make to your town. I am a member of the Lakes Entrance club and three of my children are enrolled in the Lakes Entrance nippers program. Last year Lakes Entrance was awarded the Australian Surf Life Saving Club of the Year, which is an extraordinary effort for a small country town of only 6,000 or 7,000 people and when you compare the size of the surf clubs it was competing against. The surf club does play a critical role in the social life of our town and the economic life of the region, providing the safe swimming beaches which are so important for the tourism industry. As I said previously, tourism is a major industry in the East Gippsland region. Without the surf club providing those controls on the Ninety Mile Beach on a daily basis through summer I am sure it would be very difficult for us to attract any families to that beach. Perhaps the greatest service that the surf life saving club does provide to our town is the development of our young leaders of the future. It is an incredible program to see the young people develop through the nippers program, to take on responsibility as only 13-year-olds on surf patrols, and it really gives them a sense of the importance of belonging in the community, of making a contribution to their community. It is with great pride that I inform the House that Lakes Entrance will host the Victorian junior and senior titles in March this year. It is an incredibly important event for the town in terms of the economic benefits it will bring over that weekend, with thousands of competitors and their parents in the town. We are hoping for perfect weather so the young nippers can enjoy their stay in Lakes Entrance, and we hope for some bigger waves for the seniors to be well and truly tested as they take on the elements. The club did a magnificent job of holding the junior titles in 2008. It is a credit to them that, only two years later, Surf Life Saving Victoria has seen fit to give the club both the junior and the senior titles on the one weekend. This will inject thousands of dollars into the local community. More importantly, it will give the region an opportunity to showcase its attractions and encourage people to return in the future. I commend the Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club on its efforts to secure these titles. To finish on a positive note, I commend the state government for providing some assistance with the future infrastructure needs of the club and allowing for the expansion of the clubhouse in the future."
