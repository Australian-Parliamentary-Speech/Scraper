"I am a little flabbergasted at the previous speech from the member for Newcastle. I hope she does not injure herself as she falls off that fence that she has been straddling for the last 20 minutes. I fear that poor old Grandad, who fought so hard for miners rights at Rothbury years ago, is turning over in his grave at the selling out of the coal miners of the Hunter Valley. Indeed, over the last 12 months I have had hundreds of emails from coal miners terribly concerned about the future of their jobs and the industry which they are so passionate about. I have spoken twice previously in this House on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and for the sake of my constituents I am speaking on it again. I heard the speech from the member for Oxley about an hour ago, and he said that he has been watching people in this debate speak about things that they do not believe in and have no commitment to. I can tell you that I have a commitment to this issue. I believe this is probably the single biggest issue that we as a country need to deal with in our generation. If we do not get this right, our country in the near future, as well as in future generations, will be paying for this for years to come. Since this legislation was first introduced, the Prime Minister has been getting some criticism that he has not being doing a very good job of explaining it. I do not think the Prime Minister does anything without carefully thinking it through. Being foolhardy and careless is not one of the Prime Minister’s weaknesses. The reason he has not done a very good job of explaining it is that the more he explains it the more devastating the effects on Australia become. We have heard some fantastic presentations in this House, particularly from the members on the government side, about the effects of global warming, the reality of global warming, rising sea levels. I remember the member for Isaacs had half his electorate underwater at one stage. You will get no argument from me: climate change is a real issue. Whether it is going to be as dramatic as the member for Isaacs and the contribution from before Christmas from the member for Makin, just to name a couple, have claimed, remains to be seen; but we would be foolhardy to ignore that climate change is something that we need to address. No-one from the government side has made that link, has stood up here and said, ‘You need to support the CPRS because this is how it is going to reduce the temperature of the globe.’ Not one person on that side has said, ‘This is why you need to support this bill.’ They have been very emotive about climate change, and they have been very derisive, claiming that those of us who want to dare challenge the great world leader in environment change, our Prime Minister, are deniers, dinosaurs and worse. Not one of them has defended their legislation. If they could explain to me how this legislation is going to reduce the temperature of the globe; how it is going to make it rain in the upper catchments of the Murray-Darling, so that we can return agriculture to full production; how it is not going to put the suburbs of Port Phillip under water, I would vote for it—I would support it. But they have not done that. The other thing that is quite fascinating is that last year we had this build-up to the world conference in Copenhagen, and the Prime Minister got himself appointed as a Friend of the Chair—sort of like the hall monitor of Copenhagen. He might have got a little badge that said ‘prefect’ and got to buzz around. He changed his timetable so that he could be there with the President of the United States and could be in all the shots as our world leader in fixing the climate. Of course, Copenhagen was somewhat of a disappointment, I suspect, to the Prime Minister. From my own point of view, what happened at Copenhagen was not surprising. But it is like Copenhagen never happened. I was in this House at 10.30 last Tuesday, the 2nd—I remember it very clearly—and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change, Mr Combet, was introducing this bill into the House for the third time. And guess what that day was? It is not a big deal in Australia, but many of you will have seen that great movie Groundhog Day . Last Tuesday, 2 February was Groundhog Day . I had to pinch myself that I was not sitting on the set of some bizarre movie as the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change reintroduced this bill. It was like the world had not moved on. It was like the United States had not rejected a cap-and-trade scheme and had started speaking about direct action. The member for Newcastle’s speech was a classic example of, ‘If we say something earnestly enough, and we say it often enough, it must be true.’ On the fact that this legislation would have a devastating effect on the members in her electorate—the members of the steel industry, the coal industry, the port industry—she just said that was not the case; therefore, it must not be the case! The member for Paterson was right to highlight the hypocrisy of her, and the government she is a part of, when they trumpeted in the Newcastle Herald photos of Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Rudd in their hardhats, opening new rail links and commissioning port facilities for the export of coal, an industry that this CPRS intends to tax to the hilt. How is the coal industry going to innovate? How are the electricity industry generators in the Hunter Valley, and the people the member for Newcastle represents who work in those generators, going to adapt to a lower carbon future if the top of their profits is taken off, is taxed? We have heard a lot from the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change about how this tax is going to be redistributed to pensioners and low-income earners—and that, as a matter of fact, some people are going to be better off under this scheme, so it must be good: ‘We are going to save the environment and people are going to have more money in their pockets; it is just those evil polluters that will pay.’ Well, guess who the ‘evil polluters’ are? The evil polluters are those people who, when they wake up in the morning, turn on their lights to see what the time is. When they turn the tap on and the system comes into play and they have a hot shower—they are the evil polluters. When they get on the electric train and travel into the city to work, and use electricity, they are the evil polluters. The irony of that is that, if you get into your V8 Commodore and travel from Campbelltown to the city, Mr Rudd is going to compensate you. I think he is going to give you a cent more for your fuel, if you go in your car, but if you go on the electric train, that is taxed under the CPRS. So you will pay more to go on the electric train from Campbelltown to Sydney than you would if you drive your V8 Commodore! Where is the sense in that? There was talk about compensating our pensioners, our elderly. In an aged-care facility in a medium-sized town in my electorate already the increase in electricity prices means that every bill they get has gone up by $3,000. The CPRS will probably put their electricity up by another $4,000 a month. Where is the compensation for that? Are they going to say, ‘I’m terribly sorry, Mrs Jones, your contribution to this country for the last 101 years has been magnificent but, because of the government’s CPRS, we’re going to restrict the use of your air conditioner between two and four o’clock in the afternoon’? In Coonabarabran, which is the place I am speaking about, in summertime it gets very hot. ‘But, Mrs Jones, I don’t care that you’re 101 and you’ve paid taxes all your life. You’re an evil polluter. You’re using electricity.’ Where, oh where, is the sense in that? But it is worse than that. There is no environmental impact, because the idea of the CPRS is to make people use less electricity. When you do not have an alternative, you either turn it off or you pay more. If you cannot afford to pay more, you have to turn it off. The other thing is that a lot of jobs will be exported overseas. There is no greater example in my electorate than in the town of Kandos. In the redistribution of electoral boundaries, it is going to be in the seat of Hunter, and I wonder if the member for Hunter has as much care about the people of Kandos as I do as their present member. The town of Kandos has a cement plant. It employs between 110 and 120 people and it has been there since 1880-something. There are people in that plant who have worked there all their lives and they are the sixth or seventh generation to work in that plant. Under the CPRS, Mr Rudd has said, ‘We will give you a permit for 90 per cent of your emissions—but not all of your emissions, just the emissions in the baking process.’ To make cement, you mine the limestone and the shale, then you mix it all up and crush it up and you bake it using a coal-fired power station and you end up with something called clinker. The final stage of the process is that you grind the clinker up, and that gives you your cement. Mr Rudd said to the people of Kandos cement plant: ‘We’ll give you 90 per cent for the baking process.’ That equates to 30 per cent of the total emissions cost at that plant. At the moment, the cost of producing cement in Kandos and the cost of importing it from China or Indonesia are about lineball. There is an advantage for the owners of this company because it is located in the central west of New South Wales and has handy access to the large construction areas in Western Sydney and access to western New South Wales. But with a 30 per cent increase in tax, when the competitors from China and Indonesia do not have that, guess what is going to happen. That plant is going to close and they will be importing either cement or clinker from China or Indonesia into Port Botany. That is the reality of it. That town of Kandos has one major employer. There are 1,400 people and one major employer. The town has an excellent high school and a wonderful primary school, and a lot of the other jobs—contractors, truck drivers and whatever—spin off from that plant. If it closes down, a lot of the small businesses—the supermarket, the local butcher, the newsagent, the garage—will be unviable. So the town of Kandos is in real trouble. When the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change stands up here and says that low-income earners are going to be better off under this scheme, can he explain how a cement worker who is currently on about $60,000 or $70,000 a year and is going to go on unemployment benefits is better off? Has he managed to explain that? It is not just my cement plant in Kandos. Professor Garnaut himself said, in the early work done for this government in the lead-up to this policy, that 126,000 jobs will be removed from regional Australia. If anyone wonders why we as the National Party came out early on in opposition to this scheme, it is because we were the sacrificial lambs. Regional Australia was going to pay for this scheme. The people in the leafy suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne may get a pang of conscience, trade the Volvo in and buy a Prius. Maybe they will tick the green square the next time they go to Fiji for holidays and pay a bit more for their airline ticket, or tick the box on their power bill and get some poor fellow in the hills at Crookwell to plant a few trees to ease their conscience when they turn on their hot-water system or their jacuzzi, but they do not see themselves changing their lifestyle. Maybe if they work in the banking sector, the finance sector or a large trading house they think, ‘There’s a bob to be made out of this!’ Who is going to pay? The people of the regional Australia, the farmers. We had a great discussion last year about removing agriculture from this legislation, but they were talking about removing some of the emissions of agriculture and the ability to claim any of the sequestration people can do. But look at the inputs into agriculture: fuel, farm chemicals based on petroleum and fertilisers based on petroleum. So the people of rural Australia, the farmers, the people that feed Australia and 50 million other people around the world, are going to be hit, but their counterparts overseas will not be. Oh, this is a wonderful idea! What I find astounding as I sit here and listen to the members on the other side who represent regional Australia is how they just stand here and sell out their constituencies. As the Prime Minister stands at the dispatch box at question time and talks about the CPRS and saving the world, they nod and smile in unison behind him as they sell out the people that put them here. It is worse: I have not heard the member for Maribyrnong, that great champion of the Australian Workers Union—whose membership goes right across regional Australia, in agriculture, mining and trucking—come in here and defend this scheme. You can look at the record. I would be surprised if he has. Those opposite have sold out the people that put them here. Put the member for Maribyrnong in front of a mine shaft with a TV crew and he goes like a thrashing machine. Put him in here, where he has to defend a scheme that is going to affect the livelihoods of the people who put him here, and he is silent. The sell-out of the people on that side of the House has been absolutely breathtaking. We have a debate coming up about direct action versus the CPRS. Before I came into this place, I was involved in agriculture. I understand the enormous capacity of Australian soils to store carbon. It is not a simple process. Despite the rhetoric from that side, Australian farmers are not simple folk. They do not need saving from themselves. The truth be known, Australian farmers are leading the world in their environmental practices. This is an area close to me. In the late 1980s, my brothers and I were doing experimental work with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in zero-till farming. The carbon level in those soils has grown exponentially over the last 20 or 30 years—not because they were trying to harvest carbon, but because carbon sequestration in the soil goes hand in hand with the ability of a soil to store water. In agriculture in Australia, storing water is what you need to do to grow the crops. We need to draw on that. We need to let these people in rural Australia who have been doing their bit to improve the environment continue to do so. We need to recognise it, encourage them and reward them. This debate has become one of rhetoric versus practicalities. The people of Australia are waking up. They are waking up to the facts. I will tell you how it happened in the couple of minutes that I have left. They did a poll. Eighty per cent of Australians want to do something about the environment. That is true. We all do. So the Labor Party said: ‘Let’s give ’em something. We won’t go too much into the detail; we’ll just give ’em something. We won’t explain too much about what it is, but we’ll tell ’em it’s good for them.’ What they have done is sold out the people of Australia. They have sold them down the drain. They are making them uncompetitive with the rest of the world for the sake of votes. They have been caught out. This piece of legislation, deservedly, is a dead duck and it should be treated as such.","17"

"Firstly, I thank those members who contributed to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 6) Bill 2009 . Schedule 1 of the bill abolishes the exception to capital gains tax events E1 and E2, widely known as the trust cloning exception. This is consistent with the policy principle of taxing capital gains that arise where there is a change in ownership of an asset. This schedule also provides a limited CGT rollover for the transfer of assets between fixed trusts with the same beneficiaries, each of which has the same interests in each trust. This ensures that CGT considerations are not an undue impediment to the restructure of those trusts whilst ensuring that subsequent changes to the manner and extent to which beneficiaries can benefit from the trust are subject to appropriate tax consequences. Schedule 2 amends the tax law to remove significant income tax impediments to mergers between complying superannuation funds by permitting eligible entities to roll over capital losses and revenue losses under the merger and to transfer previously realised capital losses and revenue losses. This preserves the offsetting value of the losses, thereby removing a potential barrier to superannuation fund consolidation. The loss relief will be available for complying superannuation funds that merge with another complying superannuation fund with five or more members. This assists in maintaining a robust and safe superannuation sector. This measure has a limited period of application from 24 December 2008 until 30 June 2011. Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to clarify the operation of the income tax law for life insurance companies that conduct immediate annuity business. Life insurance companies are exempt from tax on income derived in respect of immediate annuity policies that satisfy the annuity conditions. These conditions are designed to prevent the unreasonable deferral of income. The amendments clarify the circumstances in which the annuity conditions apply. This ensures that the annuity conditions in the 1997 tax act are consistent with the former annuity conditions in the 1936 tax act. Immediate annuity policies offered by life insurance companies often provide for superannuation income streams. The amendments ensure that the annuity conditions do not apply to superannuation income streams so that life insurance companies are taxed on this business in the same way as all other superannuation income stream providers. Schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to make certain organisations deductible gift recipients. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifs to organisations that are deductible gift recipients. This schedule makes the Green Institute and United States Studies Centre deductible gift recipients. It also changes the name of one organisation currently listed in the act from Dymocks Literacy Foundation Ltd to Dymocks Children’s Charities Ltd. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them to attract public support for their activities. Schedule 5 makes the income recovery subsidy payments for the north-western Queensland floods of January and February 2009 income tax exempt. These payments were designed to provide immediate financial assistance to persons affected by the flooding in north-western Queensland in January and February of this year. They were made available to Australian resident employees, small business persons and farmers over 16 years of age who experienced a loss of income as a direct result of the north-western Queensland floods in January and February 2009. Recipients must also have derived an income from, or resided in, the affected area within the designated time period. Schedule 6 makes it clear that when imported high-strength spirits are blended with domestically produced high-strength spirits the blends will remain free of duty under the concessional spirit scheme. This ensures the status quo is maintained. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.","17"

"Firstly, I would like to thank those members who contributed to this debate on the second reading of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009 . The government is committed to supporting trade and investment whilst combating tax evasion through its network of international tax agreements. This bill will give the force of law to three agreements that will support those objectives: the new tax treaty with New Zealand; the second protocol to the Belgian tax treaty, which updates the exchange-of-information provisions; and the agreement with Jersey on the allocation of taxing rights over certain income. Australia shares an exceptionally close relationship with New Zealand. The tax treaty further enhances this relationship by reducing tax impediments to the cross-border movement of people, capital and technology by facilitating cooperation between taxation authorities to reduce tax evasion and by providing increased legal and fiscal certainty for commerce between the two countries. The enhanced exchange-of-information provisions in the second protocol to the Belgian tax treaty will be an important tool in Australia’s effort to combat offshore tax evasion. The enhanced provisions will allow the exchange of information on a wider range of taxes in a wider range of circumstances. This will discourage taxpayers from participating in abusive tax arrangements by increasing the probability of detection, making it harder for it taxpayers to evade Australian tax. The agreement with Jersey was signed in conjunction with a tax information exchange agreement. The agreement on the allocation of taxing rights over certain income will help to prevent double taxation. The tax information exchange agreement between Australia and Jersey will facilitate the exchange of tax information between Jersey and Australia, once again discouraging taxpayers from participating in abusive tax arrangements. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.","17"

"… are defined as those capabilities that confer an essential strategic advantage by being available from within Australia and which, if not available, would significantly undermine defence self reliance and Australian Defence Force (ADF) operational capability.","12"
"The document goes on to list these priority industry capabilities, and under the heading ‘What are the PICs?’ the very last dot point is, lo and behold, ‘Combat Clothing and Personal Equipment’. So the minister himself, in allowing the department to authorise the sourcing of camouflage fabric from overseas, is actually defying his own policy guidelines. You have to wonder if this is sheer incompetence or whether it is the result of a government that has driven this nation into record debt and deficit and is now penny-pinching and scrimping to try and save a few dollars here and there. How much are we going to save? It was revealed in Senate estimates today that the Chinese tender was only 10 per cent cheaper than the Australian tender and that was only going to save Defence $1.5 million. Think of all the money that has been wasted with the home insulation program and all the rorting that has occurred there. Think of all those school halls that schools never wanted and had been tendered at very high prices. Think of all the waste of money going overseas that was supposed to stimulate the Australian economy. And yet this government was going to jeopardise the security of Australian servicemen and women by having this highly developed fabric produced by an overseas power. It just goes to show their priorities and their desperation in trying to retrieve some economic credibility. It is not just this pointless exercise in penny-pinching. This fabric, developed by Bruck Textiles in my electorate, in conjunction with Defence, does have very special spectral qualities. Australian taxpayers’ dollars have been invested in the development of this wonderful innovation, and this money was going to effectively be exported overseas. The government needs to stand accountable. The Minister for Defence needs to answer the questions: why did he allow this to happen in the first place and what other Defence contracts does the minister know about in his department that jeopardise Australian jobs and Australian industries? I will be pursuing the answers to these questions. These issues are of concern not only to people in my electorate but to people right around Australia. Minister, you will not be able to escape answering these questions indefinitely.","12"

"On a more sombre note, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mitsuko Hodgen, a local teacher at Parkdale Secondary College, who passed away in November 2009. Mitsuko was a Japanese teacher at Parkdale, as well as being the home room teacher and mentor for year 8F and the coordinator of the international students program. Mitsuko fought a year-long battle with lung cancer, during which time she continued to teach and to guide her year 12 students through to their final VCE exams. I know that her bravery, her strength and her dedication to her students has been an inspiration for so many in the local school community. The school has established scholarship awards in Mitsuko Hodgen’s memory. I was privileged to be at the first school assembly of the year, on 1 February, to present these awards to the inaugural recipients, Nick Dullard, Josh Churchward and Ramai Harker. I know that Mitsuko Hodgen is sadly missed by the whole school community.","12"

"Regrettably, I was not successful in having Albion Park Rail Public School listed under the program. In that regard I welcome the announcement made by the Minister for Education this week in which she has said that an additional $11 million on top of the $2½ billion already allocated to help disadvantaged schools would flow through and that data from the My School website indicated there were an additional 110 schools that would have fallen through the cracks and missed out on additional funding. The minister said that without the My School information, the federal government would never have known these 110 schools had large numbers of students that required the additional assistance. I welcome the announcement to cross-reference state data with federal data. I think there are obvious statistical discrepancies, such as the comparison between a local school, Bulli High School, and Trinity Grammar—and of course we all wait for the information about resource allocation, which ultimately can only stand to benefit students in disadvantaged schools.","12"

The member for Perth recounted very calmly the number of police prosecutions against people who have attacked Indian visitors in Australia or Indian-Australian citizens. The foreign minister showed the seriousness we need to show in confronting racism when he recounted the improvements to legislation in Victoria that will finally, after pressure that should have been accepted earlier, include racial violence as an extra crime.

"We will make pre-school education available to every Australian child.

"Although I may not agree with a lot of what the Whitlam government said and did, I certainly agree with that statement. Thirty-eight years after Gough Whitlam said that, it is unfulfilled. There are still today Indigenous communities right across Australia and other communities in country areas where such education is not available to our youngest. In 1989, Bob Hawke promised that one billion trees would be planted. Do we know—has there been a check—whether those one billion trees were planted? I would put to you that the Howard government’s program of funding Landcare planted far more trees than we could ever imagine and that was people power in action. Once again, this was a promise which has not been fulfilled that we know of—unless there has been an audit. Before the 2007 election Prime Minister Rudd promised new leadership and a new future. He held up a computer and said, ‘There’ll be one of these in every child’s hands by 2011’—next year. When questioned by young people, the Prime Minister said:","12"
"We’ve said a computer for every young person at secondary from Year 9 or above by 2013 or thereabouts …","12"

"According to Senate estimates, 154,000 of the one million promised laptops are in operation. So what he said was factually incorrect. When we as politicians make commitments before an election about what we are going to do, there should be an integrity check on the promises that we make to the Australian people; otherwise, we let them down badly. When a Prime Minister or any of us are checked like that, we have a responsibility. If we make a promise to the Australian people in an election campaign just for their green vote, like Bob Hawke in 1989, and then do not fulfil that promises, we should be called to account. And the only way we can be called to account is by the people on election day.","12"

"I rise today to support the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010 . These two bills provide timely funding for numerous very successful government programs, schemes and funds, with the appropriations being sought amounting to a little over $2 billion. A lot of these projects have been part of the federal government’s successful stimulus plan. Our nation-building plan has been very successful and widely appreciated, certainly in my electorate of Kingston. Only two weeks ago I went with the Minister for Housing to visit some of the projects that are happening on the ground in the area of social housing. We visited 16 houses being instructed in Hackham—a lovely suburb—and these houses are well on their way. I visited this location with the minister only six months before, and at that time it was an empty block waiting for construction. At that time, we met with the company organising the construction of these houses. Six months later, we are seeing houses having their kitchens put in, the plastering done, the insulation put in and very soon will be ready for the first tenants to move in. This is an incredibly successful scheme not only because it has provided much-needed housing in my local area but also because it has provided an economic stimulus and has supported jobs. When I visited there six months ago, we discussed with the project managers, Quattro, that we wanted to ensure that local people were employed. So I was very pleased to have a visit from the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator Mark Arbib. He came down and had a ‘keep Kingston working’ forum. As a result of this, we saw on the worksite, only a few weeks ago, local tradespeople—local kitchen makers from Lonsdale, local tradies from Aldinga—all working on this project. They were all getting work because of the government stimulus strategy. So I think that was an exciting project and I thank the Minister for Housing for attending that. While the minister was in the electorate of Kingston, we also visited Southern Junction Community Services, a very reputable non-government organisation providing housing to people most in need. I do note that Appropriation Bill No. 3 provides an additional close to $20 million to the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for payments under the Rental Affordability Scheme. The Rental Affordability Scheme is a particularly important scheme for electorates such as Kingston where we are seeing that the affordability of rent—and I have spoken about this many times in the parliament—is becoming out of reach. We do know that when the cost of rent or repayments exceeds 30 per cent of someone’s income they are under housing stress. I meet people day after day in my electorate who do feel housing stress, so I was very pleased that, when the Minister for Housing was down, we were able to visit Southern Junction Community Services in an area where the scheme will deliver 83 new affordable rental homes in Adelaide’s southern suburbs by 2011. We met with Graham Brown and his board of Southern Junction Community Services and we were able to discuss exactly how this was going to impact on people within our community, particularly looking at people under housing stress whether they be families or young people in southern Adelaide. These houses will have a significant impact and deliver some great outcomes. The 83 homes being built will include a mix of studio apartments, two- and three-bedroom townhouses and three-bedroom houses. This is really important because in the southern suburbs of Adelaide we have often seen that housing availability has not always accommodated the different types of households looking for it. In some areas there is not enough housing for individuals—single person houses—and in other places there is not enough housing for families. These houses are really important and they will be rented out at least 20 per cent below the market price to tenants who meet eligibility criteria. The financial pressure caused by high rental prices is something which is hurting low- and moderate-income earners around Australia. The additional funding proposed in this bill is required due to the larger than expected number of charities and non-government organisations, such as Southern Junction Community Services, seeking to participate in the scheme. The previous government really did nothing when it came to housing affordability. I know that this was an increasing issue in my local electorate. Certainly, people in my electorate have welcomed the very practical and positive things that this government has done. There is the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which I have mentioned, and also the social housing under the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. These two things are really making a difference on the ground in Kingston. Appropriation Bill No. 3 also proposes to bring forward $290 million from 2011-12 for the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts to meet the increase in demand for the Home Insulation Program which is, once again, part of our practical solution to dealing with the financial crisis. This program offers up to $1,200 in ceiling insulation to owner-occupiers, landlords and tenants. Having opened on 1 July 2009, this has been an incredibly popular program that many people have taken up. To illustrate how popular it has been, as at November last year take-up of the government’s Energy Efficient Homes package saw ceiling insulation provided for over 600,000 Australian households and around another 100,000 households took up the solar hot water package. This compares to the previous government where only 4,000 people took up the solar hot water rebate. This government has seen where there is a need. It has looked at it in a time where we needed to actually do something that not only stimulated jobs and interest in the short term but also in the long term. These programs will help many people to cut their electricity bills. I think that this is really important. We have seen in South Australia just how hot it can get. Last year we had record heatwaves. This year we have certainly had many days over 43 degrees. This does produce significant stress especially on the elderly. We saw in the 2008-09 heatwaves that people had a lot of complications and found it very difficult to keep cool in their own homes. Certainly, a number of people have approached me who do not have insulation and cannot afford air-conditioning. Enabling these people to put insulation into their homes will be particularly important. The Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010 also proposes an extra $510 million for the Solar Homes and Communities Plan. This program will be replaced by the solar credit scheme, but they both provide assistance to households, small businesses and community groups for the cost of installing solar panels on their roofs. Once again, this has been a particularly exciting and well taken up program. I know that the opposition will say, ‘Well, it was our program.’ But let us just contrast how many people have taken this up in the two years that we have been in government. In less than two years, as of November, the government was on track to fund more than 120,000 installations of solar panels. This compares to just 10,000 rebates funded over the entire period of the previous government. This is another example of where this government is taking practical action to help people reduce their energy costs and to let them feel like they are making a contribution to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. I do know, despite what the opposition might have us believe, that people are concerned about climate change. They do want to do their bit to reduce carbon emissions, and the assistance through the government’s energy efficient home package and the solar credit scheme will specifically do that. Specifically, $40 million will also be provided to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to meet the increasing demands of general employee entitlements and the redundancy scheme caused by the significant increase in bankruptcies and insolvencies. I have spoken about this before, and I anticipate that the reforms in the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 will pass through the Senate committee process. Additionally, this bill provides more remedial assistance to those affected by the provisions in this bill. Finally, these appropriations bills propose an additional $12.5 million for the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for the Local Government Reform Fund. This will allow the fund to continue helping councils to manage their infrastructure plans for the future and will assist in the construction of community buildings such as libraries, community centres, sports grounds and environmental infrastructure. I make the point that this is really important for electorates like the electorate of Kingston. It is an outer metropolitan electorate where a lot of the community infrastructure was built perhaps 30 or 40 years ago, and nothing has really been done on that community infrastructure since. So 40 years later we see infrastructure that is ageing and—unfortunately for the local council—it is in need of repair and update all at the same time because it was all built at the same time. This is causing significant concern for the council and also shows that when infrastructure is built it does need a plan for how you are going to update it, because 30 years does come around pretty quickly. In my electorate we see the need for significant upgrades in community infrastructure but, at the same time as the infrastructure that was built 30 years ago needs updating, we also see new suburbs being built that are in desperate need of this sort of community infrastructure. Once again, the government’s Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan did provide significant money to enable a lot of local community infrastructure. I was very pleased to see that the council put that money into things in my electorate such as upgrading footpaths, which were in dire need of upgrading or, in fact, needed to be put in. It sounds like a very small thing, but not having footpaths is a really difficult thing, whether for parents trying to walk around pushing prams, or for older people in their gophers. Footpaths are just a basic thing to be provided, and I take this opportunity to reflect what my constituents are saying. Whether it is local or state government, these footpaths really do need to be made a priority. So I am very pleased that the money that the federal government gives will really help local government plan for the future in terms of infrastructure. I just want to note that footpaths really need to be one of those things. In conclusion, it is important that we pass these appropriation bills in a timely fashion because they will provide money to some significantly popular programs that are creating some real stimulus in the economy. We know that the opposition wants to pull the rug out from under the stimulus, but these programs are on the ground, helping to ensure that people remain employed and building some significant benefits for the future of Australia. I commend the bills to the House.","17"

"(1) As at 14 September 2009, what was the financial cost for evidence collection and analysis by the Department of Public Prosecutions and Australian Federal Police for the case of Mr Guy Campos, including the cost of trips to East Timor and witness interviews? (2) Will the inquiry be completed; if so, will it be completed using any tools available to the Government? (3) Can he confirm that Australia is internationally obliged to pursue the matter in line with the 1949 Geneva Conventions? (4) What efforts are being undertaken to keep Mr Campos in Australia given his temporary visa expires on 18 September 2009, and the evidence so far gathered suggests that he may be open to prosecution as a war criminal.","17"
"(1) The AFP investigation into the matter of Mr Campos was conducted over the course of more than a year and involved complex inquiries into historical matters spanning several countries including Australia, East Timor and the United States. Up until 31 August 2009, the cost of the AFP investigation in Australia and abroad totalled $430,948. AFP travel costs to East Timor amount to $18,396. The costs associated with witness interviews are part of the overall cost of an AFP investigation. Up until 31 August 2009, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) had not paid any external costs for evidence collection and analysis. Since then accounts have been paid for legal advice totalling $13,420 including GST. No CDPP officers have travelled to East Timor. (2) The AFP investigation in this matter related to offences under the Crimes (Torture) Act 1988 for alleged conduct committed by Mr Campos in East Timor during the 1990s. As Mr Campos is not an Australian citizen, and as he is no longer present in Australia, he is unable to be charged in Australia under the Crimes (Torture) Act. I am advised that for these reasons the AFP investigation into these matters is not continuing. (3) The Geneva Conventions of 1949 impose an obligation on all States to prosecute or extradite a person alleged to have engaged in conduct that amounts to a ‘grave breach’ (within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions), where a prima facie case is established. It would not be appropriate to comment on whether the conduct alleged against Mr Campos amounts to a ‘grave breach’ within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions, as this would involve the provision of legal advice on a specific case. (4) Before his voluntary departure from Australia, Mr Campos was lawfully present in Australia on a bridging visa. The AFP investigation into these matters involved extensive inquiries in Australia and East Timor and the investigation was ongoing at the time of Mr Campos’ departure. The only lawful means for preventing Mr Campos from departing Australia before the expiration of his visa would have been to arrest him. However, I am advised that the AFP did not have sufficient evidence to proceed with any charge against Mr Campos at that time. (4) As Mr Campos was not at any time present in Australia as an unlawful non-citizen, it was not possible for the Attorney-General to consider whether or not to issue a Criminal Justice Stay Certificate to stay his removal under the Migration Act 1958 . In any case, where a Criminal Justice Stay Certificate is issued, it does not prevent a person from leaving Australia voluntarily.","17"
"The statement of principles referred to in Ms Bishop’s question is not in fact a statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The statement was actually adopted by the G8 at a meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Washington DC on 11 May 2004. This G8 statement of principles is, however, posted on UNHCR’s Refworld site. The Refworld site is a refugee decision support reference site, containing a collection of reports relating to situations in countries of origin, policy documents and positions, and documents relating to international and national legal frameworks. Australia is under no obligation to align its screening processes with those outlined in the G8 document. However, the principle of close cooperation between countries processing applications from asylum seekers to protect these processes from abuse by people who have been involved in terrorist activities as outlined in the G8 statement is one with which Australia strongly concurs. To this end, Australia has developed strong relationships and information sharing practices with a number of countries, taking into account asylum seekers’ legitimate confidentiality and privacy interests, to ensure that people involved in terrorist activities are not afforded undeserved protection through the refugee status assessment process. An example of these information sharing practices is that earlier this year, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that Australia has signed an agreement for biometric data sharing between Australia, Canada and the UK. Under this partnership, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will be able to securely and confidentially cross check fingerprints with Canadian and UK databases. These data sharing arrangements will allow DIAC to undertake more detailed identity enquiries if necessary, and to confirm if a client has had dealings with these countries. This will increase the chance of detecting persons of concern in immigration caseloads. The range of background checks undertaken by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship includes identity and character checks which include penal checks, where possible, with all countries in which the client has resided for more than 12 months during the previous 10 years. Australia also conducts background checks in relation to national security and counter terrorism. However, DIAC is not responsible for the processing of these checks other than to provide relevant information to the competent authority, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.","17"
