" (9:08): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I introduce the Australian Capital Territory (Self Government) Act Amendment Bill 2013. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Self Government) Act 1988 to grant the ACT Legislative Assembly the power to determine its own numbers without reference to the Commonwealth. Under the current act, the process to change the number of members of the ACT Legislative Assembly requires a resolution to be passed by that assembly, then regulations to be made by the Commonwealth to change the size of the assembly and then acceptance, by the assembly, of the regulation. This bill grants the assembly the power to independently determine and amend its own numbers and removes a complex, untimely and unnecessary process. The Centenary of Canberra this year presents us with timely opportunity to reflect on our national capital and all it has achieved over the past 100 years. Since 1913, this city has not only grown as the nation's capital, but as a city state and a home to over 300,000 people. Following the granting of self-government 25 years ago, the ACT has grown into a fully functional, self-governing territory. It has a vibrant and engaged community and a legislative assembly that is strong, mature and representative of that community. So, this bill acknowledges the capacity of the ACT to run its own affairs, and provides it the power to determine the number of members it requires to do so in the legislative assembly. So it is clear, this bill does not change the size of the assembly. It simply amends the mechanism by which the size of the assembly can be changed by removing the Commonwealthâ€™s role in the process of approving the amendments to the size of the assembly, and vesting this power back with the assembly. Appropriately, the bill incorporates a requirement for any change to the size of the assembly to be passed by a two-thirds majority of members. By promoting the need for bipartisan support for such changes to the governance of the territory, a safeguard is present, protecting our democratic traditions. Questions about the size of the ACT Legislative Assembly and the datedness of a mature parliament relying on another parliament to determine its size have been raised on multiple occasions. Only last year the ACT Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Administration and Procedure conducted a review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act. The committeeâ€™s report, released in August recommended amending the act to allow for the legislative assembly to determine its size without reference to the Commonwealth. This is not only a recommendation of the ACT Assembly. In his 2011 review of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the ACT, entitled Canberra: a capital place, Dr Allan Hawke AC, provided advice to this government on how to find the right balance of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the ACT government. In response to that review this government and the ACT agreed to work collaboratively to: improve the structure and expression of matters of national significance; simplify the capitalâ€™s planning system; reduce the overlap and duplication by better alignment of land management and planning responsibilities; by clarifying the National Capital Authority's role in the promotion of the capital; and to take account of both local and national interest through the appointment of an ACT Government nominee from the Canberra community to the board of the National Capital Authority. I am pleased to report to the House that all these initiatives are underway. We also considered the gravity of Dr Hawkeâ€™s discussion on political representation of the territory and the size of the assembly. Whilst his review did not make a specific recommendation around the size, because it was outside his terms of reference, he did make it clear: In light of the importance of robust and accountable democratic processes in the ACTâ€”characterised by high standards of parliamentary debate, a legislative program covering a range of complex issues, and an active Assembly Committee processâ€”and the significant under-representation of the citizens of the ACT, there is an overwhelming case for increasing the size of the Assembly. So, this government is responding to this additional challenge in Dr Hawkeâ€™s 2011 report. The reasons for pursuing this bill are clear and sound. It is appropriate. The ACT Legislative Assembly is a mature parliament. It is appropriate it should assume responsibility for determining the number of members needed to ensure its efficient functioning and the mechanism with which the size of the assembly is altered. The ACT Legislative Assembly is capable and ready. The passage of the bill would provide just recognition of the maturity and capacity that the legislative assembly has demonstrated since it attained self-government. It is a vote of confidence in the capacity of the ACT to manage its own affairs and its governance arrangements. Finally, it simplifies what is currently a very complex process. The bill reduces administrative effort and it streamlines the process to effect change in the numbers of the assembly. So in this centenary year, it is both timely and appropriate for the Commonwealth to make this simple yet enduring change for the future of the ACTâ€”for its people and for democracy as a whole. I commend the bill to the House."
"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the income tax law to protect the integrity of Australia's income tax system. These reforms come forward at a time of unprecedented global recognition that base erosion and profit shifting must be addressed. Last night, the OECD released its latest report on Addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which identified modern transfer pricing rules and effective anti-avoidance rules as two of the key weapons in the fight against base erosion and profit shifting. As the OECD report says, 'What is at stake is the integrity of the corporate income tax.' The government is committed to taking steps where necessary to ensure the integrity and sustainability of the tax system. Without these amendments, significant amounts of revenue that should be available for the benefit of all Australians would be at risk of not being collected. Schedule 1 amends part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which is the income tax law's general anti-avoidance rule. The amendments ensure that part IVA continues to counter schemes that comply with the technical requirements of the tax law but which, when viewed objectively, are conducted in a particular way mainly to avoid tax. Without this, there would be significant scope for taxpayers to plan their way around the law's intended operation and to undermine the revenue base. Part IVA applies when three elements exist. There must be a scheme; there must be a tax benefit obtained in connection with the scheme; and it must be reasonable to conclude that someone entered into the scheme for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit in connection with the scheme. Some recent cases have focused on the ˜tax benefit™ element of part IVA's operation. A tax benefit exists if a scheme produces a tax advantage (for example, reduced assessable income or increased deductions) being an advantage that would not have been obtained, or might reasonably be expected not to have been obtained, if the scheme had not been entered into. There are two limbs to ˜tax benefit™. The first limb concerning tax advantages that would not have been obtained without the scheme deals appropriately with cases where simply removing the scheme reveals a coherent taxable situation consistent with the substance of what happened. The second limb ”concerning tax advantages that ˜might reasonably be expected™ not to have been obtained absent the scheme” deals with cases where what is left after simply removing the scheme would not make sense or would be inconsistent with the taxpayer's actual commercial objectives and instead requires a prediction about alternative ways that the substance of what happened might reasonably have been achieved. The amendments reinforce the view that the two limbs of the tax benefit element of part IVA are alternative tests; that there is not just one test that merely spans a spectrum of likelihood. The amendments also ensure, in deciding whether an alternative to the scheme is reasonable, that regard is had both to the substance of the scheme and to the non-tax results or consequences for the taxpayer that the scheme achieved. In making that decision, the tax consequences of the alternative are ignored. The proper role for the tax benefit test is to compare the tax consequences of what the taxpayer actually did with the tax consequences of a reasonable alternative that achieves substantively the same thing. It makes little sense in an anti-avoidance provision to allow the tax consequences of what the taxpayer has achieved to act as a shield against the operation of part IVA. These amendments ensure that a taxpayer who, having achieved something from a scheme (tax results aside), cannot say they did not obtain a tax benefit by arguing that, absent the scheme, they would have pursued completely different objectives, or done nothing at all. These amendments have been through an extensive consultation process. In addition to the government's usual public consultation on draft legislation, the design process included a lengthy series of consultations with a round table of academic, legal and tax experts, and advice from a number of senior counsel. As a result, the government is confident that these amendments will ensure that part IVA properly protects the integrity of the tax law without unnecessarily interfering with taxpayers normal commercial activities. Schedule 2 to this bill modernises Australia's transfer pricing rules in accordance with the government's announcement in November 2011. It provides a new, comprehensive and robust transfer pricing regime that is aligned with internationally accepted principles. The transfer pricing rules are critical to the integrity of the tax system. They ensure that an appropriate return for the contribution of Australian operations of a multinational group is taxable in Australia for the benefit of the broader Australian community. The transfer pricing rules do not depend on the existence of a tax avoidance purpose. Transfer pricing rules ensure an arm's-length tax outcome is achieved for non-arm's-length arrangements or transactions, even where those arrangements or transactions have a legitimate commercial purpose. A key feature of the new rules is their alignment with international best practice as set out by the OECD. Alignment with international norms improves the integrity and efficiency of the tax system, and reduces compliance costs and uncertainty for taxpayers. The OECD's Transfer Pricing Guidelines are widely used by tax administrations and multinational enterprises globally. The amendments provide a clear legal pathway to the use of OECD guidance material to assist in applying the arm's-length principle. As well as alignment with the OECD guidance material, several design features of the new rules will further promote efficiency and certainty. The new rules operate on a self-assessment basis, bringing the transfer pricing rules in line with the overall design of the Australian tax system. In contrast to the old rules, which relied upon the Commissioner making a determination, taxpayers will now be able to self-assess their Australian tax position in accordance with the arm's-length principle. Specific rules linking voluntary documentation with a reduction in administrative penalties are included under the new rules. This approach balances compliance costs for taxpayers with incentives to adequately document issues relevant to transfer pricing matters. It allows taxpayers to risk assess matters that could be the subject of administrative penalties and prepare documentation accordingly. The new rules also introduce a time limit in which the commissioner may amend a taxpayer's assessment to give effect to a transfer pricing adjustment. Under the previous rules, the commissioner had an unlimited period in which to amend an assessment. These rules reduce this period to seven years. Given that transfer pricing audits often require information from other jurisdictions and involve complex arrangements spanning several income years, this time limit strikes an appropriate balance between providing the commissioner with the time required to conduct an audit, and providing taxpayers with increased certainty as to their tax affairs. The new rules also maintain the existing interaction between the transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules that were developed in close consultation with industry during amendments to the transfer pricing rules last year. The government has engaged extensively with industry, corporate and community representatives over the course of the reforms to Australia's transfer pricing rules. The bill has benefited significantly as a result of the consultation process. And I would like to acknowledge these important contributions from those who have contributed to the policy design process. The measures contained in this bill are vital for maintaining the integrity of the Australian income tax system. Robust and properly functioning integrity rules are critical to maintaining a healthy tax system so that the government can continue to deliver the public goods and services that Australians expect and require, like world-class health and education systems, a strong social safety net and public infrastructure. Full details of the amendments in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum."
"I rise to support the Completion of Kakadu National Park (Koongarra Project Area Repeal) Bill 2013. Last week, Djok senior traditional owner Jeffrey Lee AM was here in the parliament when this legislation was introduced into the House. Jeffrey Lee is to be commended for his tireless and courageous efforts to protect his country up against some very powerful interests. Because of his endurance, Koongarra was finally recognised in June 2011 by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee as having both cultural and environmental significance. Jeffrey Lee made a statement when this bill was introduced: I have said no to uranium mining at Koongarra, because I believe that the land and my cultural beliefs are more important than mining and money. Money comes and goes, but the land is always here. It always stays if we look after it and it will look after us. In 1979, the land Jeffrey has looked after an area of 1,228 hectares right beside the famous Nourlangie Rock, with its remarkable rock art, was excluded from the Kakadu National Park because of its potential uranium resources. The French owned company AREVA - the largest nuclear energy company in the world - owned the lease and wished to mine the 14,000 tonnes of uranium there, so much so that they attempted to stop the UNESCO World Heritage Committee from debating and deciding to fold the area into Kakadu National Park at the express wishes of the Djok traditional owners. Koongarra should have been in Kakadu long ago, but it will finally have the protection it deserves upon the passage of this bill when it is officially included in the park. This is a win for the long-term future of the region and for the integrity of the Kakadu World Heritage area. But let us be clear, Kakadu, the jewel in Australia's tourism industry, with its natural wonders such as sandstone escarpments, huge waterfalls, tropical rainforests and wetlands alive with birds, is threatened by another mine. The Ranger uranium mine was literally forced on the Aboriginal people when their right to refuse was ripped away through legislation in 1978. Ranger is a leaking disaster. My colleague, Senator Ludlam, has established through Senate estimates hearings that over 100,000 litres of contaminated water leaks into the ground beneath Kakadu National Park every day. In addition to that, over 150 leak spills and licence breaches have been recorded since the mine opened. In 2011, uranium processing at Ranger was suspended for six months following a tropical wet season that left the tailings dam near capacity. Yet, despite ongoing problems and ageing infrastructure, the ERA is considering the expansion of Ranger. The construction of a tunnel for underground mining in the guise of 'exploration' has commenced without any environmental scrutiny. This exploration is clearly the first stage of what could become a new underground mine. The Greens strongly believe along with the many people who have written to the environment minister, Tony Burke, that the minister should take up his responsibility to scrutinise this nuclear action under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The minister would be protecting the environmental and cultural significance of Kakadu through so doing. While I call upon the environment minister to protect Kakadu from the ongoing threat at Ranger and want to stress that this bill is misnamed, Kakadu is not complete until Ranger is closed, I wish to commend him today for delivering on a Labor election promise to bring Koongarra into Kakadu National Park, which the Greens welcome and congratulate him for. The ALP still has a very confused nuclear policy. On one hand, the mining and exporting of the uranium that literally fuelled the Fukushima nuclear disaster is promoted. Labor also wants to pour uranium into India, a state with a history of illicit nuclear procurement and inadequate export controls and a country that is continuing to expand its nuclear arsenal and missile capabilities, making the subcontinent the hottest nuclear stand-off in the world. On the other hand, today Kakadu is protected from more uranium mining with this bill. On one hand, Labor supports the use of nuclear weapons in our own security policies by participating in the US nuclear umbrella and thereby legitimising the possession of nuclear weapons. On the other, it strives to be an advocate of nuclear disarmament, sponsoring the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament. Despite this profound confusion, sometimes Labor gets nuclear policy right, and today is one of those times. I commend this bill to the House."
"I too rise to speak in support of the Completion of Kakadu National Park (Koongarra Project Area Repeal) Bill 2013. I do so on quite an extraordinary day. We have heard two fantastic speeches from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and from Minister Macklin as well. The two speeches from the two leaders show bipartisan support on a day that is significant for Indigenous Australians, the fifth anniversary of the apology. But it is also the fifth anniversary of my first day in this parliament. I remember we started that day five years ago with an acknowledgement of country, so that is what I am going to do too, acknowledge the traditional owners and thank them for their continuing stewardship. It is strange to think that it has only been for five years that we have been doing that as a parliament. Now it is obviously a part of the fabric of this place and the fabric of the nation. I agree with the member for Parramatta that Kakadu National Park is a treasure. I do not like the term 'bucket list' but I will use the member for Parramatta's term and indicate that it is a place I would love to visit. I have a nephew who lives up there and has also worked in Kakadu, and he assures me there are places he would love to take me to. I look forward to doing that in the future. The existence of Kakadu National Park is in no small measure due to two significant people in this process: Jeffrey Lee and Bob Hawke. And I am glad that I am here speaking before the member for Banks and with Minister Crean at the table, because I know they would have had a bit to do with that process over the years. Bob Hawke, as Prime Minister, was responsible for Kakadu stages 2 and 3. I think the nation owes him a great debt. Stage 2 was better known in the media at the time as the Coronation Hill decision. I was a bit young at the time and not as closely interested in politics, but it is my understanding that Prime Minister Hawke basically put his leadership on the line. No doubt that had repercussions for him later down the track. But I am glad he had the courage to make that brave call. We look at Kakadu today, and no-one in the world would question that Bob Hawke was on the right side of history in the call he made. If you go to the rock lookout at Nourlangie, in Kakadu National Park, you will find historically significant rock art for Lightning Man dreaming. This is one of the most popular tourist sites in Kakadu National Park, which also overlooks Koongarra. What you are overlooking is an area that has had the shadow of potential uranium mining over it for the life of Kakadu National Park. I am proud to say that the Gillard Labor government is introducing this legislation into parliament to stop this occurring. We are now completing the million-year journey of Kakadu National Park, taking the final steps in making sure the area of Kakadu is indeed protected forever. This government has completed the Labor legacy that was advanced so far during the years of the Hawke government. It is well known that Jeffrey Lee was offered in effect millions of dollars for his interests in the area, but made the brave call to care for the land the way his ancestors had for 60,000 years beforehand. Mr Lee is the sole member of the Djok clan and the senior custodian of the Koongarra uranium deposit and has effectively decided never to allow the ecologically sensitive land to be mined. This decision is significant for Australia and the world. It affirms Kakadu's premier status as a World Heritage site. This, as people who understand the United Nations process would know, means that it is of international significance. I think we should all be very proud as Australians that part of our land is owned by Jeffrey Lee, and we should be especially proud of the decisions he has made. This Labor government and all Labor governments, one would say certainly since Bob Hawke and Gough Whitlamâ€”have had a proud history of great environmental achievements. Kakadu is only part of our story. We started as the party of jobs. I am sure that the shearers on strike out at Barcaldine were not talking about environmental issues, apart from how hot it was out at Barcaldine during the strike, sheltering under the gum trees and a bit of old canvas. But since then, particularly since the trade union activities of the 1960s and 1970s, we have also been the party of the environment. In fact some say that the blue-collar trade unions were at the forefront of the environmental movement. In Queensland, where I come from, we have the Great Barrier Reef and some other significant environmental sites. I would mention Fraser Island for one. During the term of this government we have also made great advances in the Coral Sea. The Coral Sea is internationally recognised for its rich biodiversity and heritage value. The Labor government has recognised the need to protect the Coral Sea with a conservation marine park. This Coral Sea Marine Park initiative is recognised internationally because of its unique physical, ecological and heritage value. We can stand up proudly because of the global leadership we have shown in protecting this endangered biodiversity. The Gillard government is focused on conserving our environment, its ecological features and its marine regions. The Coral Sea is home to a number of historic shipwrecks, as students of World War II history would know. These are significant to Australian heritage. Obviously they include the region where the Battle of the Coral Sea took place during World War II, where many shipwrecks can still be found among the reefs. Australia is well known for its vast marine environment, containing many iconic, ecologically important and fragile places that are in need of protection. Environmental policy within Australia seeks to improve how the decisions are made regarding the protection of marine biodiversity and the sustainable use of our ocean resources. In June last year the Centre for Policy Development released an economic evaluation of the proposed Commonwealth Marine Reserve Network. The evaluation reported a number of important aspects that support the Labor ambition to create permanent protection for the Coral Sea, emphasising the government's plans to increase Australia's fully protected marine parks to $2 billion a year in ecosystem servicesâ€”the services come from coral reefs, seagrasses, coastal shelf and open ocean. The plan will preserve Australia's marine economy, maintaining long-term productivity of the marine estate. It will reduce the damaging forms of fishing, including bottom trawling, and this will deliver long-term benefits for recreational and commercial fishers using more sustainable practices. I particularly commend the commercial fishers for the great work they have done in this process already, despite some of the fear campaigns that are out there. Recent studies in the protected Great Barrier Reef have shown rebuilding of biomass of local fish populations in ways that are likely to produce long-term benefits to fishers. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature identified that 42 per cent of the world's most critically endangered and vulnerable coral species are found in the Coral Sea Conservation Zone. This region is internationally recognised as a significant location for threatened marine species. So, the Australian government's decision to implement a permanent Coral Sea marine park demonstrates global leadership by acting to preserve this important region and reduce the loss of global biodiversity. I note Minister Burke, who is in the chamber, for the great work he has done in this area. Another environmental achievement I am proud of is the Gillard government's plan to deliver an additional 450 gigalitres of water to the Murray-Darling Basin. This measure recently passed through the parliament. This legislation secures $1.77 billion to relax key operating constraints and to recover the additional water through projects that do not have a social and economic impact on communities. This will be achieved through improvements in irrigation efficiency. We are looking after jobs, but we are also looking after the environment for the future. It will address existing constraints that limit higher water flows, including outflows from storage dams, low-lying infrastructure, and the need to provide for flood easements or agreements with landholders. The Gillard Labor government is driven to protect our precious environment. We recently opened applications for funding under the second round of the Biodiversity Fund and the first round of Target Area Grants, under the Caring for our Country program. These funding opportunities are a step towards investing in a healthy and more resilient environment by supporting volunteers, farmers and community groups, all together, to make a real difference in their local area. In my electorate of Moreton, there is a number of fantastic volunteer working groups who work hard to protect local environment. Just to name a few: the activists at Beyond Zero Emissions; the Benarrawa Bushcare Group; the Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee; the local conservation volunteers; the Friends of Oxley Creek Common and the Oxley Creek Catchment Associationâ€”they do incredible work and have been recognised with awards; the Friends of Stable Swamp Creek; the Gaddes Park Bushcare Group; the Moorooka Greening Group; and the friends of Toohey Forest, who need a bit of a rejig at the moment. I have had dirt under my fingernails with some of these groups and I am proud of the work that they do. It is good for their soul and good for their health as well, but also good for the environment. There are countless initiatives this government has taken towards environmental protection, including banning supertrawlersâ€”and I see Minister Burke made some comments about that yesterday, with some additional safeguardsâ€”adding Tarkine to the National Heritage List, the recruitment of specialised local staff to restore the Murray-Darling Basin, investing to help improve urban waterways, the Western Australian marine parks program, and the internationally recognised price on carbon. We are a world leader in this area. In Kakadu, we have one of the most precious places on earth. The governments of the world have recognised that, so this bill helps us to complete Kakadu National Park. It allows this Labor government to conclude the legacy of the Hawke Labor government and allows Australia to proudly respect the wishes of the traditional owners and say that the wishes that they have had for their land will be respected for ever and Kakadu National Park will be complete. I commend the bill to the House."
"Particularly with this 43rd Parliament, a parliament in which no party holds an absolute majority, I am sure that there are days when those outside look in and just shake their heads at some of the behaviour, some of the partisanship and some of what passes for debate here in this place. But I am sure that this is not one of those days, a day on which we collectively together passed a bill to finally put in place a referendum to acknowledge the Indigenous people of this land and a day on which we are well on our way to passing a very important bill that gives hope, I feel, to the very many Australians who care for those with disabilities and the very many Australians who carry the challenges of disability. It is a great pleasure to rise on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. This bill will fundamentally change the way we deliver care and support for people with a disability. I am pleased to note the opposition's support for the bill, something which, as I said, is not always the case in this place. The bill establishes the framework for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency. This will enable to the scheme to be launched in five sites across Australia from July 2013. I am pleased to note that one of these sites is in the Hunter region and includes Maitland, which is in my electorate. This is great news for people in my local region, particularly those with a disability and their families and carers. I know that it is very encouraging to the many people in my electorate who devote their lives professionally to assisting people with a disability. This vital stage of the NDIS will mean that approximately 10,000 people in the Hunter region and 20,000 nationwide with a significant and permanent disability will be covered under the NDIS. For the first time, these people will be assessed to receive individual care and support packages as well as be able to make decisions about their own care and choose their service provider. They will have the assistance of local coordinators, who will help manage and deliver their support while providing them with a link to mainstream services. This is all about making sure that people with a disability will have more control over their lives, more certainty about the level of care that they will receive and more opportunities to get involved in work, school and community life. I am lucky that in my electorate there are many excellent organisations that assist people with disabilities. One of these is Integrated Living Australia in Muswellbrook. I was pleased to announce last year, along with the minister, that they would be receiving $190,000 to help us get ready for the introduction of the NDIS. An essential part of getting this change right is developing practical, real-world ways to make sure that an NDIS can work in the way that it is supposed to for people with a disability. The team at Integrated Living will be developing a new how-to guide for small and medium organisations to help them adjust to an NDIS environment. This is a historic reform and we need to make sure that the disability sector is supported to make the change so that Australians with a disability, their families and their carers can start benefitting from the NDIS as quickly as is possible. The government has been very proactive in its approach by providing grants to organisations like the Kurri Kurri Community Centre, in my electorate, through the NDIS readiness fund. The government has also worked closely with state and territory governments on the design, governance and funding of the scheme. I was very pleased when New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell agreed to sign up to the trial in the Hunter. That was a very important milestone. The COAG process can be a tough one, but I am very pleased that everyone was able to put politics aside and do the right thing by people who need our support. This bill has two main purposes. The first is to establish the framework of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I have already stated that the scheme gives people with a disability more control over the care and support that they receive. Importantly, it also allows this care and support to be considered as part of a whole-of-life approach. It will respond to each individual's goals and aspirations for life and take into account their individual circumstances. It will also look at the support that carers need to sustain their caring role and assist by strengthening other informal and community supports that are important for people with a disability. The scheme moves away from the crisis model under which families only receive support if they are unable to continue in their caring role and there are no other options. Instead, it will work with families before they reach crisis point to make sure that the valuable care that they provide can be sustained. There is also a strong focus on early intervention, especially in situations in which there is good evidence that this care and support will sustainably improve a person's functioning or slow or prevent the progression of their disability over their lifetime. The other main purpose of the bill is to establish the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency, to operate the first stage of the scheme. Very importantly, the agency will be a body independent of government. In addition to delivering the scheme, it will perform a range of functions, including managing the financial sustainability of the scheme, building community awareness about disability and undertaking research about disability and the social contributors to disability. Importantly, the agency will be established as a body under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, which is in line with the Productivity Commission's recommendation. This takes the care and support out of the cycle of budgets and elections. This is not something that should be subject to the whims of budget debate. Before I finish today, I would like to make mention of a few other disability support organisations in my electorate. Places like Endeavour Industries, Mai Wel, Koora Industries and Whitmore Enterprises all do fantastic work on the job with people with a disability by providing them with support and employment. Endeavour Industries in Cessnock was also successful last year in receiving nearly $3 million to help build six co-living units which will be dispersed through medium density housing and will include landscaped grounds and a hydrotherapy pool. This is a great addition to the Cessnock community. I am always pleased as member of parliament to be able to support organisations and projects like these. They play a vital role in our community and in the lives of people with a disability and, of course, their families. Every member in this place would have had an experience with people with a disability whether it be in someone's household, in an operation like Mai Wel in Maitland, where so many people with disabilities are being gainfully employed, or at a special school which caters for handicapped children. I say this in the most positive way, I am sure that most, if not all, people in this place would have found that experience somewhat confronting. I certainly do, and I look on in awe not only at the way individuals seek to overcome the challenge of their disability but also at those people who give their lives to those who are struggling, whether they do that in a family sense because they are related in some way, whether they happen to be a neighbour or whether it is in the professional sense. I was so delighted that some of those people were rewarded last year when we provided $7 million out of the BER to build a brand new Hunter River Community School on the eastern side of Maitland. This school is full of wonderful children, in some cases severely challenged. Again, I am just so in awe of the teachers and other assistants that work with those kids on a daily basis. What a wonderful thing it is that we can now take them out of their temporary demountable buildings and give them a brand new school In my 17 years here, no grant has made me happier than that one. The New South Wales Department of Education wanted to move the school out of my electorate to a new location just outside of my electorateâ€”indeed, into the electorate of the member for Paterson. They called to ask me whether I had any objection to that, and I said, 'I don't care where you build the school as long as it remains accessible to those who use it on a daily basis.' I was very happy to agree to that. The same applies to all of those people who work within those organisations I referred to earlier. They do wonderful work. I think they do work that I must admit I would struggle with if I had to engage with it on a daily basis. On the flip-side, when I go to places like Whitmore, Endeavour and Mai Wel which employ people with challenges, I find nothing but joy and happiness, and it is good to have a little bit of banter with the workers there. They are always very pleased to see meâ€”not exclusively me of course, just any visitor. They are always proud of what they are doing and they are really doing productive work. I think collectively as members of parliament we can be proud and satisfied that we have schemes in place that allow these people to engage in the workforce in a very normal way and to work in a happy environment as these people I encounter do. I have to say that it should almost be self-mandating for us to visit them at least three or four times a year, because it is an uplifting experience. We think we have challenges in life, and I suppose we certainly do in this environment of the 43rd parliament, but theseâ€”I am tempted to call them kids, but of course they are notâ€”workers in these industries are always just so happy. They always seem so satisfied with what they are doing, and from that we take comfort that their families are also happy that they have found meaningful work in life. There are also others out there who can reach the higher echelons of the business world or politics. We should be doing all we can to help them do so and to ensure that they are able to overcome the sometimes serious challenges that have been put in their path. It should be a very high priority for us. I was so disappointed when I first came to this place. I had a local experience with a 21-year-old guy who had had a car accident, had suffered brain damage and was living in a dementia ward in a nursing home in my electorate. That shocked me, and I was even more shocked when I pursued the issue on my arrival in this place and found out that he was certainly not alone. He was one of tens of thousandsâ€”I think it is tens of thousands; I hope I have not overstated that, but it is certainly a very large numberâ€”of Australians still at a young age who find themselves in nursing homes with very elderly patients, sometimes in dementia wards. That is unacceptable. I know it is improving, but I do believe we need to do more to ensure that is not the ongoing case. I congratulate the minister, I congratulate the government, I congratulate the opposition for its largely bipartisan approach to what is a very serious issue for our country and I commend the bill to the House."
"In rising to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012, I am by no means the first, and I certainly won't be the last, to stand in this chamber and say that the current system of support for people with a disability is definitely broken. We have a system where, if you have a disability, the level of support you get is dependent on a whole range of factors, many of them entirely out of your control, from the state you live in to whether the disability is inherited or acquired. If it was acquired, when did it happen? Where? How? Are you covered by workplace compensation or motor vehicle accident insurance? Or will you be subjected to long waiting lists and queues? This lack of support when it is really needed is resulting every day in heartbreaking situations where people with a disability are not living, just existing, and the situation for their families and caregivers is often not much better. We need a new system of support, a system that puts the individual and their needs at the centre, in charge and able to pick the supports, aids, equipment and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The technical nitty-gritty is that this bill establishes the framework for the NDIS and the NDIS Launch Transition Agency. This will enable the scheme to be launched and the agency to operate the launch in five sites across Australia from July 2013. But the detail does not communicate just what the real impact of this bill will be, if it is done right. Here, today, I would like to put some human faces to this debate. People in my electorate have not been shy in coming forward to tell me how this bill will make a real and lasting difference, and I want to share these stories. The first is Mrs Colleen Dolan, who is 77 years old and has just been awarded an Order of Australia Medal. She has spent 40 years working on behalf of Far North Queensland's disabled community. It all started when Mrs Dolan tried to enrol her daughter Lynette at a local kindergarten but they would not accept her because she had Down syndrome. The principal said the staff were not qualified and she 'had to think of the prestige of the kindergarten'. 'That was the attitude in those days', says Mrs Dolan: 'unfortunately, there was very little available for people with disabilities and they were herded, segregated and not involved in the community at all.' she started her own kindergarten and eventually closed the other one down. She kept fighting too, helping establish two key disability groups: the Cairns Regional Family Network and the Leisure Connections Association. Her daughter Lynette has benefited hugely from this targeted supportâ€”she lives in her own unit, does her own housework, can decide what she wants for lunch and gets support for budgeting and shopping. Mrs Dolan believes the NDIS has wonderful potential but wants to make sure that the funding does not get tied up in bureaucracy, that it gets to the people it needs to on the ground. She is also worried about how people will be assessedâ€”will they get the support they need to be able to live an ordinary life, as in Lynette's situation, or will they only get what they need to exist? Mrs Dolan says it does take timeâ€”many yearsâ€”but the government should look at the money they spend in disability as an investment. Individualised funding may cost more in the short term but people can achieve a level of independence and quality of life. The alternative is that they spend 50 to 60 years in a totally dependent state. There is no argument which is better, socially and financially, for society. Another example is Kylie Allen, a young mum aged 33 from Cairns, who wrote to me late last year. She wrote: I have 3 children (4 yrs, 2 yrs & 9 months), two with Special Needs. My daughter has an extremely rare chromosome condition known as 6p Deletion. There are only 30 documented people worldwide and because it is so rare, it is not recognised by the Government and we have to pay for her therapy, Doctors and specialists. My eldest son has Autism and whilst he has the Helping Children with Autism Funding, there are three panel providers in Cairns and so we still are forced to pay for therapy ourselves. The NDIS means that the financial strain will be lifted on our family andâ€”more importantlyâ€”that my children can receive the health care and support they need, and to lead a happy quality lifeâ€”just like their non-affected peers. Vernon Lewis is a 62-year-old from Earlville, a real character. He wrote: I was diagnosed with MS in 1989 and the complaint is advancing slowly all the time. I seek to continue to make a difference in my community in spite of, or perhaps because of that. My involvement with the Lions Club at Trinity Beach, the Cairns Choral Society, the Centenary Lakes church as well as the Trinity Beach Lions and MS (TBLAMS) Support Group all mean I am a valuable member of this community. It would be great if this could continue for many years to come. I am concerned that my condition will deteriorate so I am unable to make the valued contributions I have been able to make so far. I need the NDIS to provide the assurance that the support I need will be available when I need it most. Please make this something other than a political football â€¦ my hope is that there can be a bi-partisan approach to getting this done and NOW!! The previous speaker, my friend and colleague the member for Hunter, pushed and stressed the need for a bipartisan approach. I think that has been very much accepted through the course of this debate, and I am confident that we will be able to continue like that. Another face to this debate is Cindy Eagle. She lives in Edge Hill and has a particularly tragic story. Her nephew was born 12 years ago and as a newborn suffered blood clots in his brain. He is severely disabled, cannot walk or talk and still has to wear nappies. He has cerebral palsy, a blood-clotting disease and epilepsy, and in his first year he had dozens of fits every day. Cindy does not know how her sister and her husband do it. The whole family scrimps and saves for equipment; everything for the disabled is so expensive and, at this point in time, government help is next to nothing. She tells me that her sister has had to sell their house, that they have lost their super funds and that they have moved rental homes 14 times in the last 10 years trying to get somewhere suitableâ€”which appears to be impossible. In 12 years they have not had a holiday or even gone to the movies together. There always has to be one of them by their son's side due to his complicated medical requirements, and he certainly cannot travel. He needs so much therapy to get a piece of a decent life, but this is beyond their means: they live every day just to get by. They love their son to death, but they have lost their lives and are under immense stress, pressure and physical exhaustion. This could be you or one of your loved ones at any time. Life as you know it could disappear and you could exist in hopelessness and misery. She thanks us, as members of this place, for our commitment to this cause, in the hope that she will be able to see the establishment of this NDIS. Katherine Kramer from Kewarra Beach is a full-time carer for her brother, who was injured in an accident many years ago. She says that: We are fortunate in that he was covered by insurance. This has enabled us to look after him in his own home. Many others are in similar circumstances but can't afford to care for their loved ones due to financial pressures and lack of resources. The NDIS can do this for them. Jacqueline Black, from Freshwater, is an occupational therapist. These are people who are right at the coalface, who are providing the service and the care at the moment, and who certainly have a very strong interest in and a very comprehensive understanding of the challenges and the issues that are faced by individuals and families in dealing with these problems. Jacqueline has said: I have worked with many people with disabilities and their families. Every one of them, as individuals and as family units, would have benefited from improved access to therapy, equipment, appropriate housing and carer support. Their participation in the community, at school and in the workplace could always have been better facilitated. The NDIS is necessary to begin dealing with the compromised and inequitable provision of services that currently exists. We hear the same from Maree Cotton from Cairns, who also works for a disability employment service. She says: I see so many people receive different levels of support depending on how and where their disability was acquired. We need to provide people with disability and their families and carers with regular care, support and the equipment they need. Shane Yuleâ€”who is another amazing individualâ€”is from Manoora. He is youth worker for disabled children: The hardest part of my job is dealing with the system. The kids are an absolute pleasure to work with but it's sad to see how many kids go without and don't get the funding they deserve. Why should disabled people be disadvantaged? Please support this cause. The challenges that these families face every day are the justification for establishing the NDISâ€”no-one in this place would dispute that. However, at the end of the day, this is an insurance policy and it certainly needs to be properly funded. It may well be that we need to incrementally introduce it to make it affordable. That is why the coalition has proposed a bipartisan parliamentary committeeâ€”so that support for the scheme does not waiver across three terms of parliament and along with the nine different governments that are going to be needed to make this system work. Unfortunately, I have got to say that there have been claims that the NDIS is owned by one side of parliament or another. I would argue that that is not the case. I think that everybody in this place and everybody right across the whole political spectrum has shown very, very strong support for this. But we really needâ€”and this is something that the government needs to do at the momentâ€”to be told how this NDIS is going to be funded. We have supported the government's commitment of $1 billion to the NDIS in the federal budget, but we know that it is going to cost a lot more than that. The Productivity Commission has stated that $3.9 billion will be necessary over the forward estimates for the first phase of the NDIS. I look forward to hearing how the government will account for this and make appropriate provisions in the coming budget, because we cannot raise expectations for these desperate people unless we are absolutely able to deliver these services. Every day that we do not do this, there are families in my area and many other areas that are going to be let down. My side of politics and I certainly want the NDIS to be a success. We have enthusiastically supported each milestone on the road to the NDIS. We want the launch sites to run very, very smoothly. We believe that the NDIS can be delivered within the time frame recommended by a government that can manage its finances well. We stand ready to work with the government in all jurisdictions to make the NDIS a reality."
"I rise today to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. This is a bill that is a once-in-a-generation landmark reform that has the potential to deliver better quality-of-life outcomes for Australians with disabilities, as well as their carers, friends and everyone else who is entrusted with the care of people with disability in this country. I last spoke on the NDIS in August when the Prime Ministerâ€”following the release of the Productivity Commission inquiry report entitled Disability care and support, which identified that disability care in Australia was underfunded, unfair, fragmented and inefficientâ€”announced that major reform was needed. Since then, all state and territory governments have also agreed on the need for major reform through the NDIS. I am very pleased to be able to stand here today and say that the government is well on its way to delivering on this very much needed reform. I am also very pleased to speak on the NDIS now that it is pretty much on the threshold of becoming a reality. Once passed, the NDIS rollout is expected to begin in mid-2013. I do want to acknowledge that the opposition is supporting the NDIS and that many members on the other side have made some very heartfelt speeches. There is no doubt that many of my own colleagues on this side have made many heartfelt speeches in support of the NDIS. As I have said, the National Disability Insurance Scheme is very much a centrepiece of this government's agenda. The NDIS has come to fruition through the bill we are debating today as a result of the solid work undertaken by government ministers embarking on a series of wide-reaching consultations with state and territory governments and with people with disabilities, their families and carers. It is also very much a result of the hard work and continued advocacy of organisations that represent those Australians living with a form of disability that effectively renders them dependent on carers, care workers and service deliverers. Through the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme 2012, the government has resolved to act in order to support people with disabilities and, more importantly, to help them lead a more active and productive life and to enhance the quality of their life. The NDIS will ensure that people with disability will be able to achieve, to the best of their ability, their full potential, which obviously will benefit not only them but society as a whole. In particular, it will benefit those people charged with caring for them. The legislation sets out a framework for a national scheme, one that should take an insurance approach and that shares the cost of disability services and supports across the community. It is a framework that will initially operate in five locations. The first stage of the NDIS rollout will begin in South Australia and Tasmania and will include regional areas. Regional areas will also be covered in other launch sites. In my home state of Victoria, the Barwon local government areas of the City of Greater Geelong, the Colac Otway Shire, the Burrough of Queenscliffe and the Surf Coast Shire will be locations of that first rollout. Over the years, as the member for Calwell I have had many, many conversations and many representations from my constituents regarding issues associated with caring for people with disabilities. The single greatest anxiety of the parents I have met who have children with disabilities is what will happen to their children once they are no longer around to look after them. Nothing is more traumatic, more poignant, than having a conversation with a parent who has a child they are responsible for even into their adult years and who has to ponder the inevitable: what will happen to my child when I am not here and am unable to look after them? In the NDIS we have a scheme that responds to the real human face of those anxieties and concerns. The person who comes to mind for me first and foremost is one of my local community activists, Mrs Betty Moore, who has been on this case for as long as I have been the member for Calwell and probably well before that. Betty is a full-time carer for her son Jonathan, who has Down syndrome. I first met Betty years ago when she came into my office and asked me in a very frank and direct wayâ€”because that is how Betty does thingsâ€”if I realised just how much money she and other carers save governments. They save governments money because they do the heavy lifting in areas we are responsible for taking care of and funding. That was her question. It left a lasting impression on me. Her greatest concern, like so many other parents in similar positions, is of course what will happen to Jonathan when she becomes too old and frail to care for him. Betty has become a full-time activist for the rights of people with a disability. For many years she has served on the management committee of Brite Services, which is a supported employment provider in my electorate. She is very much a tireless advocate, lobbying governments, advocating for ways in which the lives of carers can be made easier and finding ways in which people with disabilities can live more productive lives, particularly through employment opportunities. Her son Jonathan has enjoyed many years of employment at Brite. The NDIS framework will benefit parents such as Betty by providing long-term certainty to the resourcing of disability care and support. It is, after all, surety and security for loved ones that Betty and everybody else wants, because for them it has always been about the kids. But the NDIS is also about the carers. It will offer them support to help them sustain their caring role and strengthen the broader community support as well. I know that the NDIS will be very much welcomed by my electorate. There are thousands of people in Calwell who are currently on disability support pensions and thousands of carers who have had to take significant reductions in their incomes in order to care for family and loved ones. Importantly, and this goes to the heart of human dignity, compassion and sacrifice, the NDIS will recognise the overwhelming care and devotion that millions of Australians give to their loved ones who are living with disability. It also recognises the impact on quality of life that past inaction and inefficiencies have caused and have brought to bear on those Australians and their families. The NDIS has a needs-based approach, changing the concept from the charity approach of the past to one centred on individuals choosing the services they want, thus giving them power to make decisions and control their lives. The positive effect of individuals having the power to control their lives and make decisions should never be underestimated. It goes to the core of human dignity. I have seen this firsthand through the extraordinary work of Brite Services, which is the major employment services provider for people with disabilities in my electorate. Brite has a demonstrated, long-term commitment to improving social inclusion and economic participation for people with a range of disabilities and vocationally disadvantaged backgrounds. I have had many dealings with Brite over the years and I have always admired its accomplishments. I have also always admired the commitment of the people at Brite to the people that they are looking after and to the people that they effectively employ. Brite's current CEO is Ms Julie McKayâ€”and I need to mention Julie because she is doing a wonderful job steering this incredible organisation into new and exciting directions. Brite's social and disability enterprise models are both practical and innovative solutions to enable employment and training opportunities for people who can so easily fall through the cracks of the current employment services system. In her own words, Julie feels 'there is so much more potential that can be unleashed in the social and disability enterprise sector'. I believe that we here today are unleashing some of that potential with the passage of this bill. However, Brite's accomplishments as an employment services provider have not just happened overnight; it has taken years of hard work by locals, parents, community groups and businesses. Brite's journey began in 1968 when a group of parents in the northern suburbs of Melbourne were looking to establish a facility and services for their children with a disability. Brite Services was officially founded in 1976. Today it is a $3.2 million enterprise and one of the largest employers of people with disabilities in Hume. It always takes the community to make a beginning, to fight the good fight and to establish institutions that later go on to serve the community so admirably. Brite is one of those institutions. It operates as a highly reputable training provider, and is employer to over 200 people with a disability and people from disadvantaged backgrounds annuallyâ€”my electorate is rated as having one of the highest areas of social and economic disadvantage in Australia. Since 2007, Brite has championed alternative and innovative employment models, such as its social enterprise intermediate labour market model, to improve access to training and employment and it has done so with tremendous success. This model is designed to meet the needs of local job seekers by providing local jobs. Like Brite's vision, the NDIS aims to provide individuals with equity and access to training and employment for a better life. From the feedback in my local community to the feedback across the length and breadth of this country, I can report to the House that the NDIS is strongly supported because it responds to and aims to redress the key fault lines identified for people living with disability and for those who care for them. The government is aware that the current disability system encourages crisis, meting out support only when it is desperately needed and, of course, with meagre and inadequate resources. The government has listened and has understood how people with disability often feel shut out and frustrated at not being able to join the workforce and contribute to society in a way which is meaningful to them. By taking a lifelong approach through the NDIS, the bill will focus on intensive early intervention, particularly where there is good evidence that it will improve a person's functioning or slow or prevent the progression of their disability over their lifetime. The bill also considers other crucial elements of the NDIS, including interactions with compensation schemes, registration of service providers, appointment of nominees in certain circumstances and merit reviews. In conclusion, through this bill the government aims to help people with disabilities to achieve rather than focus on what they cannot achieve. Many people have waited many years for government action in this area, and finally this government has delivered a response. The NDIS means dignity, freedom and choice for people not just in my electorate but Australia wide, so it is with great pleasure that I am able to support this bill before the House. I commend all members who have spoken in support of this bill, and I also want to acknowledge and commend the opposition members who speak in support of this bill."
"It is my privilege to rise and support the National Disability Insurance Scheme in the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012, which is before this House, because the NDIS is truly a historic reform for our country and for our parliament. It could not have come any sooner for the more than 400,000 Australians who have a significant disability and for their families and their carers. It is particularly important today to acknowledge that the NDIS has bipartisan support. I would like to take this opportunity to praise government ministers, in particular the member for Maribyrnong, who championed this cause when he was the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, and also a former state MP, John Della Bosca, who has done a lot of work with the Every Australian Counts campaign. On our side of the House I would also like to pay particular tribute to Senator Mitch Fifield, who is our shadow minister for disabilities, but also to our leader, Tony Abbott, who has personally championed this cause and in fact, in last year's Pollie Pedal, which he undertakes annually, raised more than $500,000 for carers. It is through the combination of the government and the opposition that we will together see that the NDIS becomes a reality. We have supported the NDIS in a bipartisan way ever since it was first referred in 2009 to the Productivity Commission. We supported it when a billion dollars was allocated over the forward estimates for these launch sites, and we support it in this bill before the House and the subsequent implementation of the NDIS. Big ideas and big reforms start as a kernel of an idea, but if they are going to be legislated into reality they need champions in this place. I am proud to say that there are those on both sides of the divide. I also want to give particular credit to one of my constituents and friends whose name is Bruce Bonyhady. He is Chairman of Yooralla and also President of the Philanthropy Australia Council. He has promoted and pursued the concept of the NDIS with every fibre of his body. To the people who have participated in the Every Australian Counts campaign, and so many others, I say thank you. In my electorate, there are so many organisations and community groups that work in this important area of disability support. There is St Paul's College at Villa Maria; Belmore School, a special school in Balwyn; and the Association for Children with a Disability in Hawthorn. There is Q ArtStudio, which allows people with a disability to pursue their untapped talents for the arts; e.motion21 is a wonderful group that allows young people with a disability to pursue dance as a way of enjoying their life and pursuing a recreation; Vatmi Industries, which provides employment opportunities; and EDAR, which is in Surrey Hills, Balwyn and Balwyn North. And there are many, many other organisations and outstanding individuals like Ariane Garner-Williams, who I have met, who have been ambassadors for people with a disability. During this time these community groups and these individuals have championed the idea of an NDIS. They have kept the pressure on people in this place to see that this reform becomes a reality. The bill before us today establishes a framework for the NDIS and establishes the NDIS Launch Transition Agency, which will operate the scheme initially in five locations starting in mid-2013â€”South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, the Hunter in New South Wales and Barwon in my home state of Victoria. This new agency will fund individual support packages and block-fund some entities. Eligibility to become a participant requires that a person's impairment to have resulted in 'substantially reduced functional capacity' which affects their mobility, learning, social interaction, communication, self-care or self-management. Once a person is eligible support can be granted to alleviate, prevent or mitigate deterioration in a person's functional capacity. Importantly, people over 65 years of age will not be eligible to request NDIS support. However, if a person is already receiving NDIS support and does turn 65 they can continue with that support. Each eligible person will have a plan prepared for them detailing the support they receive under the scheme, the management of those funds and the date for review. At a later date there will be further NDIS rules which will outline the process for becoming a plan manager as well as rights and processes pertaining to reviews under the scheme. There will be an agency board with a chair and eight board members who will have a range of skills and experiences across the financial, insurance and disability sectors. The Commonwealth will appoint the chair and will require a majority of jurisdictions to support the board appointments. Importantly, there will be an independent advisory council with at least four people with a disability on it, at least two carers and someone who has skills in the supply of equipment to help people with a disability. There will be an independent review of the act that will take place after two years. These are important logistics that can actually turn this reform into a reality. It is no secret that we on this side of the House have called on the government to establish a joint parliamentary committee which would be chaired by representatives of both sides of the political divide to oversee the implementation of the NDIS. Issues of design, eligibility and delivery will still need to be worked through over the coming years, and this should be done in a bipartisan manner because no one single party or no one single person owns the NDIS; it belongs to the community as a whole and the notion of a bipartisan committee to oversight its implementation is a step in a positive direction. It is quite different to having a parliamentary committee inquire into this bill or into the NDIS. This would be setting up a permanent committee to deal with the transition and implementation. It is unfortunate that the Leader of the Opposition has had to write five times to the Prime Minister about this and my colleague the member for Dawson, George Christensen, has introduced a private member's bill. Despite these efforts on our side, the government has refused to countenance, to this point, this idea of a bipartisan committee to oversee the implementation. Nevertheless, we will continue to promote this amendment. We do not want to see a repeat of the wrangling we saw between Liberal premiers and the government before the last COAG meeting, because we need to be above the partisanship, particularly when it comes to this reform. At the end of the day, this reform is too important for us to fail. The NDIS needs to be properly funded by this government and they are going to have to explain where they are going to find the additional billions of dollars that the Productivity Commission has said would be necessary over the forward estimates, because the target deadline for getting a full scheme up and running is 2018-2019. We have criticised the fact that only $1 billion has been set aside for the forward estimates to reach these five trial sites, which will reach up to 20,000 people with a significant disability. This is a start, but it is not enough. We are here today debating the NDIS and pushing it through as a parliament, as a significant reform, because the system has been broken. The system of funding and supporting people with disabilities has failed the Australian people. It is just not right that depending on where and how you got that particular disabilityâ€”for example, whether it was in a car accident or by birth, or whether you live in South Australia or Victoriaâ€”you are funded differently for the same disability. It is not right. With another Australian becoming significantly disabled every 30 minutes, this is a serious issue. I want to remind the chamber what the Productivity Commission said back in July 2011 when they reported to government: The current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient. It gives people with a disability little choice, no certainty of access to appropriate supports and little scope to participate in the community. Those are damning words and they resonate not just in this House but also across the Australian community in every small town and in every big city. If we are going to find that additional $6.5 billion annually that was identified by the Productivity Commission, we will see funding for disabilities increase by up to 90 per cent. Currently the states and the territories provide $4.7 billion and the Commonwealth $2.3 billion annually for people with a disability. But we need to find that additional $6.5 billion. If we do find it in a bipartisan manner then we will see funding for people with a disability reach about the same level as the disability support pension. It will be more than we allocate to the PBS, but it will be less than the $18 billion a year that we allocate to Medicare. Questions about the funding are absolutely criticalâ€”it requires the bipartisan support of this House and it requires a decision by the political leadership of this country to prioritise the funding of people with disabilities, because at the end of the day we do not have an endless pie of money that we can just pull from for every particular need. We have to prioritise and, as far as I am concerned, we need to prioritise supporting people with a disability. My eyes were opened when I was at university teaching tennis on a voluntary basis with a group called the Kids Tennis Foundation. We would go out to some public courts every weekâ€”I and a man called Bob Crumpâ€”and teach kids with Down syndrome how to hit a tennis ball. You would think kids with Down syndrome could not hit a tennis ball, and you would be right. But the point is that they got out on the court every week, threw a racket around, missed nine out of 10 balls, but the smiles on their faces would bring a tear to anyone's eye. I know that my colleagues on the other side of the House and my colleagues on this side of the House have had similar experiences as they have attended the morning teas in their electorate under the banner of Every Australian Counts, as they have visited Yooralla, as they have visited the art studios and the dance studios that give opportunities for young people with a disability, as they have spoken to the carers who give so much of their time and are underpaid to support people with disabilities, and as they have sat down with the family of a child or an adult with a disability they have heard those personal stories. I think the NDIS speaks to our humanity as a nation. It speaks to our personal compassion. It is actually why we are all here. We may disagree on the avenue and the route to finding the same place, but that same place is all about creating a stronger, fairer, more prosperous society. If we grasp this opportunity to take the NDIS beyond this bill before the House and beyond these five trial sites that have been set down, we will have achieved something that previous parliaments have never done. The people of Australia are watching us. They are hoping that we can deliver on that promise, and we should not let them down."
"Today the first shipment of live buffalo since the new animal welfare requirements came into force will leave Darwin. This is a huge relief for the entire Territory community who have been crippled by the Gillard Labor government's 2011 knee-jerk reaction to ban live exports. This decision damaged our $1 billion livestock industry, weakened industry confidence within the Territory and threatened Territory jobs. I can only imagine the thousands of dollars lost by Territory cattle farmers, the uncertainty they experienced during the ban, the fear they endured while wondering if their livelihoods would be destroyed forever and the pain they suffered while getting their industry back on track. There are some interesting facts coming out of the Senate estimates hearings, particularly that the Labor government gifted $20 million to the Indonesian cattle industry, which has not been spentâ€”no new projects started at allâ€”while the government only allocated $12.7 million to Australian industry. This demonstrates a blatant lack of understanding this government has for our farmers and the industry. The lack of assistance for our livestock industryâ€”particularly, not doing enough to support the industry open new marketsâ€”has allowed overseas competitors to reap the benefits and cripple our local market. The coalition supports the $1 billion live export industry and, given the opportunity, will work with farmers to address the continuing destructive impact of the 2011 live cattle export ban."

"I dealt with this matter yesterday when asked about the minerals resource rent tax. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to my remarks yesterday. I refer him to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and he can have a look at the figures himself. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that behind all of the political skirmishing about the minerals resource rent tax that the Leader of the Opposition engaged in yesterday is a fundamental policy question that the Leader of the Opposition needs to answer. Does he believe that it is better for mining companies to be taxed at the height of their profitability or does he believe in a royalty system which hits mines in set-up, which hits mines when they are not profitableâ€”"

"For the benefit of the member who asked the question and those on that side of the House, as well as the member for Denison, I will explain the way in which the budget works and forecasts are done. I am surprised that the member asking the question does not know, given that she served as a minister in a government. But apparently, from the question, she does not. So let's go through the way it works. What government does is we make decisions, we make policies, we make budgets, we make fiscal strategies. We work with the experts at Treasury, who ensure, with the experts at Finance, that policies are costed and that budget projections are done, including revenue projections. So I would remind the member who asked the question that the revenue projections, whether they are for the minerals resource rent tax, whether they are for company tax, whether they are in fact for personal taxâ€”the tax that workers payâ€”or whether they are for capital gains tax, are put together by experts at Treasury using the best of their expertise, all with goodwill. It is done for this government; it was done for governments in the past, including the Howard government; and it will be done for governments in the future. Then, of course, we see the actual performance against their forecasts and projections, and there are times in which there is a variance between the two. There is a variance now across many of the revenue categories of government, which was not forecast by Treasury and which means that we are seeing revenue, as a percentage of GDP, at its lowest point since the 1990s. That is, revenue has not returned in the way in which Treasury has predicted. So it is defying the usual economic orthodoxy and economic models. There are a variety of factors feeding into this. Commodity price volatility is certainly one of them. And the high Australian dollar is certainly a very strong factor feeding into it. Not only does it press on industry sectors like manufacturing and tourism and suppress profits, but it actually has implications for the resources sector when contracts are priced in American dollars. Then, of course, continued sluggishness in the global economy also has implications for the Australian economy for revenue and for projections. The member opposite, in asking the question, should recognise the importance of understanding these factors to being able to project plans for jobs and growth in the future. So no-one should go around insulting the professionals at Treasury. That is not appropriate and not right. We will continue to focus on jobs and growth, despite the negativity of those opposite.

"I have received a letter from the honourable the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The adverse impact of the government's management of the mining tax on investment in Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesâ€”"
"It was illegal, the government told us, for weeks. It could not possibly release any informationâ€”finally, $126 million or less than 10 per cent of the much reduced estimates. As Dennis Atkins in the Courier-Mail said this morning, with the money raised from the mining tax, they would struggle to cover the hospitality bill at Eddie Obeid's ski lodge! That is what they have done. Then, by the time you offset the company tax and pay for the administration, virtually nothing has been raised from the mining tax. Finally, the government said that the mining tax was all about 'spreading the benefits of the boom'. Well, $126 million divided by 22 million Australians is just a little more than $5 eachâ€”aren't we grateful? The mining tax was always a bad idea. It was always terrible policy for three reasons: first, you do not speed up the slow lane of the economy by slowing down the fast lane; second, you do not strengthen our economy by weakening its strongest sector; and thirdâ€”something that members opposite just do not understandâ€”you will never build prosperity by increasing taxes. It was always bad policy. But, if the idea was bad, the execution has been even worse. The minister for resourcesâ€”and I have to say that, if there is one of the three signatories to the mining tax deal who does have some respect in the sector, it is the minister for resourcesâ€”had a rare burst of candour in question time today when he said, 'This was the tax the mining industry wanted.' Of course they wanted it, because it was the tax that they never had to pay! It was a tax that they knew they were never going to have to pay. They did not want any new tax but, if there had to be a new tax, let it be one that they did not have to pay! The truth is that the Prime Minister and the Treasurerâ€”who, let us never forget, personally negotiated this tax; the great negotiator!â€”personally negotiated this tax. Treasury officials were kicked out of the room. The great negotiator was comprehensively out-negotiated and comprehensively outwitted by the mining bosses. You know, I think she knew she had been outwitted. I am sure she knew she had been outwitted and I am sure the Treasurer knew he had been outwitted, but they did not really care that they had been outwitted because they just needed a deal to take to the election. They needed a deal to take to the election, because do you know what they counted on? Breaking it as soon as the election had come and gone. There is a pattern of conduct here. This is a government that promises whatever it takes to get what it wants today and breaks that promise to get what it wants tomorrow. It does it again and again and again. The Prime Minister told us before the last electionâ€”told the Australian people before the electionâ€”that there would be 'no carbon tax' to win the votes of the people, and she promptly broke that promise to get the support of the Greens. The Prime Minister promised that there would be mandatory precommitment for poker machines to get the support of Andrew Wilkie, the member for Denison, and she then promptly broke that promise to keep the support of caucus. The Prime Minister promised that there would be a surplus this year; she made that promise to demonstrate her economic credibility, and then promptly broke that promise to win support from voters so that bribe after bribe could be offered in the run-up to this election. The government promised the miners a tax they would not pay to buy peace before the last election. Now it is going to break that promise so that it can pay for a whole range of pre-election bribes. This is a pattern of conduct from this government. I want to say today, a day where this parliament has done great things, that this government is not all bad. We did do something this morningâ€”and the government did something this morningâ€”that we should all respect. But, when it comes to the fundamentals of governing this nation, no government has ever been worse. It is fundamentally incompetent and fundamentally untrustworthy, and the mining tax shambles is an absolute illustration of those facts. The Prime Minister, let's never forget, told us back in June 2010 that 'a good government had lost its way'. That is what she said in June 2010: 'A good government had lost its way.' Well, she never even believed that. She never even believed that it was a good government, because she subsequently told us, to carpet bomb the member for Griffith out of a leadership challenge, that in fact it was a chaotic and dysfunctional government. She said back then in June 2010 that three things would be fixed: she would fix climate change, and she has fixed that by introducing the carbon tax that she said there never ever would be; she said she would fix the border protection disaster, and that is so fixed that we have had 26,000 illegal arrivals by boat on this Prime Minister's watch, the largest influx in our history; and then she said she would fix the mining tax, and she has fixed the mining tax with an act of pure geniusâ€”the only tax ever introduced that hardly raises any revenue. It damages investments, it damages jobs, but it does not raise any revenue. But that is only one half of the dynamic duo now responsible for the stewardship of this nation; what about the Treasurer? He was going to give us a surplus; he promised it on, I think, 366 separate occasions, and now there is no surplus. He promised us that he was going to give us half a million jobs within two years; time is almost up and we have got less than a third of the new jobs promised. Then he promised us, of course, $2 billion in mining tax revenue in this financial year, and we have had less than 10 per cent. Has there ever been a worse government in our history? I used to think that the Whitlam government had been worse, but that is so unfair to Gough Whitlam, who never sold his soul to the Greens the way this government has. We have had some remarkable combinations at the top of government in our country. We had the remarkable combination of Bob Hawke and Paul Keatingâ€”a great reforming pair at the top of this country. And then we had the remarkable combination of John Howard and Peter Costelloâ€”probably the best Prime Minister-Treasurer combination in our history. And what have we got now? This Prime Minister and this Treasurerâ€”Gillard and Swan. No wonder the Australian people cannot wait for an election."

"Let alone the treachery. I wonder how much longer he will be the Deputy Prime Minister? How much longer will he be Treasurer now that we have a second train crash, with the MRRT? If the member for Griffith were to return to the top job, he would probably last a nanosecond. However, will he last much longer under the present Prime Minister? He can count on her loyalty, of course, can't he? The Treasurer, if he is worried about his position, might find it instructive to talk to the member for Scullin, the member for Barton and Senator Trish Crossin, to name a few. They can all vouch for the Prime Minister's loyalty, can't they? What is going to happen to Swannie? It reminds me of the old Russian tradition of throwing the weakest individuals out of the sleigh as the baying wolf pack gets closer and closer. I wonder who is going to be the next one to be ejected, Wayne? Desperate prime ministers do desperate things and, given this Prime Minister's inability to take responsibility for any of the disasters that she has presided over, there will be a scapegoat. In this case, I cannot think of a more deserving scapegoat than the Treasurer. Let us look at some of the detail of this mining tax. The government that broke its word on the carbon tax and the surplus is now planning to break its word on the mining tax. The government is desperate for cash following yet another fiascoâ€”the amazing disappearing budget surplus. By the way: thanks for that, Treasurerâ€”that was another one of his disasters. With a non-existent surplus, Labor is now scratching around for some more revenue. It seems that the Prime Minister is on track to rip up her 2010 written agreement with the mining companies in the same way that she ripped up the written agreement with the member for Denison on gambling reform. Now we have the mining tax in a shambles. The only certainty for miners in Australia and for the investment community is that if Labor is re-elected it will increase and broaden the impact of the mining tax after the election. There is no doubt at all that that is the case. In the event that anybody was under the misapprehension that the mining tax was not in a shambles, think of the message that this is sending to the international investment community. After months of hiding the truth, we now know that the mining tax has raised only a fraction of the revenue promised in the budget and in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, MYEFO. It has grossed $126 million. But that is not the full story. You see, when you remove the lower company tax payments of about $40 million and then remove the administration costsâ€”estimated by the government to be about $50 million over three yearsâ€”you find that it has raised virtually nothing. And yet the Treasurer has linked over $15 billion worth of expenditure to this mining tax and now has no money to pay for its promises. Having raised only a fraction of what was intended, Labor is now indicating that they will grab more money from the states and the mining companies after the election to fill their mining tax black hole. They will take more money from the states and they will take more from companies. Do you know what that means? Fewer services from state governments and fewer jobs and investment in Australian mining companies. The Treasurer likes to blame iron ore prices for his mining tax disaster, but this claim does not stack up. In the MYEFO, the MRRT was projected to raise $2 billion in mining tax revenue, but since MYEFO was released iron ore spot prices have actually increased by about $30 a tonne. So blaming weak commodity prices for missing his revenue forecasts by 90 per cent defies reason. This is yet another colossal forecasting error by the government. The MRRT failure is the third strike against the Treasurer's economic credibility, and fortunately the member for Griffith is keeping count. The Treasurer promised a surplus, he promised 500,000 new jobs and he promised a mining tax to pay for $15 billion in promises. He has broken all three promises. Labor has a Treasurer with zero economic credibility. Yesterday the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade let the cat out of the bag when they admitted they have a process in place which we know will result in a grab for state government mining royalties as a way of compensating for their failed mining tax and their mining tax black hole. Labor's plan to hit the states with yet another tax grab means less for services for nurses, for teachers, for police and less for infrastructure. In the case of my state of Western Australia and in the case of Queensland this infrastructure is needed to underpin the very mining sector with whom this government is at war. It is not spreading the wealth; it is spreading the pain as state governments are forced to cut back on essential services. The sovereign risk caused by this return to the MRRT is on top of a litany of government decisions that have tarnished Australia's international reputation. The resources areaâ€”remember the hit to condensate. Without any warning to industry they removed a tax exemption on condensate. At the time, we said that it was an absolute smash and grab raid and that it was the equivalent of a drive-by shooting against the oil and gas industry. The other beauty was the infamous decision on live cattle exports that resulted in Australian producers losing potentially half of their market in the long run. In the last 12 months the government has reneged on the purchase of munitions and on the purchase of self-propelled artillery, both to the detriment of a reputable South Korean firm. As a result, the Executive Director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute commented: It's a major problem when a big company from a trading partner as important as South Korea chooses not to compete for business in Australia on the basis of 'sovereign risk'â€”a term indicating a serious lack of confidence in our policy settings. By the way, Samsung was reported as saying that this government had been disingenuous and dishonourable in its dealings with them. This government is a disgrace, and a mining tax is yet another example of why. (Time expired)"
"The rabbit is another one. The development of the Holden Sunbirdâ€”I mean, no-one would want to be caught dead being in a photo with that one! In more recent times we have had the iSnack 2.0. I think that lasted four days on the shelves. Click Frenzy, which happened last year, probably did not even last four minutes before the internet system went down and nobody could buy anything. And even Slim Dusty, that great Australian songwriter, put a song together about a failure: the Pub With No Beer, he called it. But I have to tell you that there is nothing so lonesome, morbid or funny than to gamble your surplus on a tax with no money. The reality is that we have got another failure here in front of us with this mining tax and it is a failure of epic proportions. The thing about failures is that most people actually learn from them, do something about them and move on. But the government will not even acknowledge its failure on the mining tax front. The Treasurer was dragged, kicking and screaming, to announce to the public that this tax had raised only $126 million in half of a year of its operationâ€”a quarter of what it was predicted to raise. He talks about the need for this tax to spread the wealth and spread the benefits around to everyone. As the member for Casey pointed out the other day, it is spreading $5.50 to every Australiaâ€”fantastic! It is not even enough to buy a McDonald's meal. We have heard the Treasurer and the Prime Minister blame all sorts of different things for the reason this tax has fallen short. We have heard the blame falling on commodity prices. The Treasurer has certainly said that no commodity analysts or economists had forecast the tumble that took place in iron ore prices last year, but the fact is that iron ore prices have actually risenâ€”so that is not a real excuse. But he did say that the resources rent taxes, by their nature, are difficult to forecast and that jumps and falls in the revenue relative to the estimates is to be expected. He is trying to blame it on international pressures on the mining industry or the resource industry and what that does with prices. But then we have another excuse, and that is that it is the states' fault. This seems to be the Prime Minister's approach, that it is all those terrible state governmentsâ€”even the Labor state governmentsâ€”that are doing the wrong thing by having royalties. Royalties are something that state governments have always had and that were in existence for the life of the Howard government, when we did not have great deficits and debt. This is something that has been around for a long time, yet somehow it is the states' problem. Then we had the member Lyne coming in, as part of that menagerie that makes up the government, saying that it is these loopholes that are the flaw in the system and saying that these loopholes allow Rio and BHP to have $1.7 billion credits to buffer themselves from paying the taxâ€”as TheAge put in its newspaper today. But the thing is that these are not flaws; it was a tax that was actually designed that way. The tax was actually designed to allow the big miners to have $1.7 billion in credits to buffer themselves from paying. It was a deliberate design that was done in the deal that the Prime Minister made with the big three miners after she knifed the member for Griffith and took over his job."
"Thank you, for the opportunity to contribute to this matter of public importance about the adverse impact of the government's mismanagement of the mining tax on investment. As has been eloquently said by my colleagues before me, our nation's wealth is built on strong economic management that provides the stable and certain conditions essential to attract investment. It is our nation's great misfortune that this stability and certainty has been progressively undermined by five years of economic and policy ineptitude under this Labor government. Over a very long period of time our nation has earned the highest reputation of one that could be depended upon, of a people whose hand you could shake, whose word could be given and trusted. This reputation was built under fire on foreign battlefields as the staunchest and most heroic of allies. This reputation has been built during peacetime, with relationships based on the foundations of integrity and trustworthiness with our trading partnersâ€”sometimes with the same countries against whom we have endured conflict. This reputation has been developed through generosity for those in need in times of disaster or hardship, or through assistance to build a better future. We have shared our good fortune. This reputation has been built on the sporting fields of the world, not just through our successes, but through our willingness to compete against the odds, try with our all and, if defeat visits, smile, shake hands and look forward to the next opportunity to compete. Reputations are so hard won but so easily tarnished. Values of honesty, integrity and trustworthiness are not fashions that may come and go. They are the essential building blocks for a country building a great future to establish and demonstrate in every endeavour and at every dealing. Today's MPI topic of the adverse impact of the mismanagement of the mining tax on investment is representative of the past five years under this Labor government. Unfortunately, day after day in this place, and in every home, and the places we visit in our electorates, there are questions about this government's values, their honesty, their integrity and their trustworthiness. Time and again we have seen calculated promises, made in the heat of an election campaign, that put politics above policy. We have seen deals done with Independents to negotiate power and paid for with our dollarsâ€”politics above policy. There were promises broken and deals reneged upon. How far does this sad characteristic extend and what are the consequences? We all saw the choices made in the face of the GFC: pink batts, school halls that were overpriced and often not needed and $900 cheques dispersed. These initiatives were plagued by rorts and rip-offs, high cost and more debt and were for no benefit. Surely we can do better. Sovereign risk had never been a label attached to Australia. Sadly now it is, and there are consequences as collateral damage manifests. This mismanagement of the mining tax is just the most recent example. Prior to that, we saw the memorandum of understanding with the pharmaceutical industry, where the government promised certainty through the PBAC process for PBS inclusion in return for the industry forgoing significant revenues. Not even 12 months had elapsed and the government backed away from their agreement through cabinet deferrals of PBAC recommendations. Tremors reverberated around the pharmaceutical world, and Australia and sovereign risk were mentioned in the same sentence for the first time. Export income of $4 billion, more than the car and wine industry, $1 billion in research and development and huge current and future investment in this sector were put in peril. Just like with this mining tax fiasco, this mismanagement of economic policy does not just affect the companies but also affects the people we are here to represent. In my electorate of Bennelong there is a company that has developed the first innovation in over 50 years in medical treatment for stroke in atrial fibrillation, replacing the use of warfarin, a type of rat poison, as a treatment of this life-threatening condition. This innovation has passed our TGA and PBAC processes. Even our neighbour New Zealand has listed this medicine, but not us. Instead, this government, in a move that only creates uncertainty for investment in our nation, has decided for the first time ever to conduct a lengthy and costly review of the medicine before it is even listed on the PBS. Also, in a reply I received last week to a question on notice to the Minister for Health, the minister could not even commit that they would not have yet another review of this medicine prior to its listing. Another example of poor government policy impacting on investment was the response to the ABC Four Corners story regarding live cattle exports to Indonesia. Policy decisions made in haste to grab a headline and appease certain interest groups served only to damage our nation's standing in the international community, devastate our relationship with our closest neighbour and destroy an industry that generated over $700 million in foreign income per annum and happened to be the biggest employer of Indigenous people in the region. Australia was again cited as a nation of sovereign risk. The reason cited by Prime Minister Gillard for her challenge against the former Prime Minister Rudd was that he had lost his wayâ€”the government had lost direction. The first course of action was to meet with the mining industry and mend the Minerals Resource Rent Tax. It was claimed that in six days, working tirelessly with the Treasurer, this was done. In conflict with this claim, if I recall correctly the Treasurer's first responsibility under the government of Gillard was to replace the deposed Prime Minister and attend the G20 meeting in Canada for a two-day conference. If you add travel timeâ€”one day there and one day backâ€”that left only 2 days to work out the new MRRT. Jet lag is well known to reduce your ability to calculate complex equations. Possibly this is where the problem lies in the failure of what was negotiated to deliver what was promised. Whether it was jet lag, incompetence or simply being outmatched by skilful negotiators on the other side, the result is undeniable. The mining world, which has delivered such wealth to us, was traumatised by these events, and all for no benefit. The mining industry now risks investment in war-torn Africa in preference to the risks involved in doing business in Australia under this government. This represents the gravest consequences produced by sovereign risk. This has occurred because this government does not have the timeless building blocks based on the values of honesty, integrity and trustworthiness. Great damage has been done, but for what benefit? The MRRT was projected to generate more than $10.5 billion to fund programs that included the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the education reforms recommended in the Gonski report. However, in the first 6 months only $126 million has been received. When this is impacted by implementation and administration costs of some $50 million, and lost tax revenues, which are in the vicinity of $40 million; this conspires to make a most worrisome situation. Short-term thinking may just rack this shortfall sum up on the national credit card, but it must be widely recognised by now that debt is simply future taxes. Yes, there will be those with short-term selfish views: yes, slug the big miners and give us a share. You may be distressed to learn that when $126 million is impacted by the setup costs and the loss of revenues, you will get only about a dollar each. Responsible government should behave differently and place policy above short-term cheap politics. The building of industries and relationships with our trading partners must be based on trust, on certainty and on stability. If a government is unstable, it is very hard to produce stable government. It may not be in fashion to adhere to such values, but when you are entrusted with the responsibility of protecting our wealth, our future and our reputation, only these values, which we have fought to establish as core to the Australian character, will suffice. Values that establish honesty, integrity and trust must replace the political expediency that has so tarnished our reputation with the words 'sovereign risk'."
"In rising to speak to the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2013, I do so in the background that we previously passed through this Houseâ€”and indeed it has been passed into lawâ€”an amendment to the Public Service Act that was designed to give a new setting for the public service. This bill is a mirror version of that, applying to Parliamentary Services. It arose from a long-term piece of work done by the public service entitled Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration. One of the most important things it does is strengthen the values and Code of Conduct and establish employment principles for Parliamentary Service. Likewise, it did similar things for the Public Service. But it is important to realise the distinction between the Public Service and the Parliamentary Service, even though the bills mirror each other. But, importantly, there is a clause in the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill that says in the proposed section 9 (2) that the role of the Parliamentary Service is to provide: â€¦ professional support, advice and facilities to each House of the Parliament, to parliamentary committees and to Senators and Members of the House of Representatives â€¦ And it is proposed that section 9 (2) confirms that this role is carried out: â€¦ independently of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth. I think those are important words to put on the record, because it is specifically to make both houses of parliament work so that we can serve the needs of the people. The Parliamentary Service values set out in proposed section 10 provide that the Parliamentary Service is committed to service and is ethical, respectful, accountable and impartial, and that is the way in which most members and senators who deal with the Parliamentary Service find that they act. Nonetheless, it is important to have it in the bill. Other important clauses, which is also in the Public Service Act, are the whistleblower provisions. It is important in a lot of the discussion that is currently going on regarding whistleblowers that we allow the provisions in these two new billsâ€”the public service bill is now law and this one will soon be lawâ€”that they be given an opportunity to show how they work. I know that others might like to put in regimes which they think will be better, but a lot of work has gone on to prepare both pieces of legislation, and an amount of discussion has gone on between the government and the opposition, to ensure that there is agreement between the government and the opposition and that it is supported by us both. In this life the Public Service has to serve both sides of parliament. One side will be in government from time to time and then the other will be there. The reliance on the Public Service is extraordinarily important to good government and it is important that both the Parliamentary Services Amendment Bill and the Public Service Amendment Bill are given the support of both the government and the opposition. There was only one serious amendment that I was able to move to the public service bill, and that related to the ability, under the original provisions, of the Prime Minister to extend the terms of departmental secretaries who have resigned or whose contracts have ended. I am pleased to say that no such provision was included in the Parliamentary Services Amendment Bill. I do not think there is a need for me to speak at great length, except to say that a lot of work went into the preparation of both bills, that both the Public Service and the Parliamentary Service believe that the employment principles will be important and easier for them to deal with, and that the code of conduct is strong and stresses the ethics that are needed for those who are employed in both services. I am pleased to say that the negotiation that went on between the minister at the table and me resulted in us being able to bring to the parliament bills that we really do think serve the needs of the parliament and, indeed, the Public Service. The opposition will be supporting the Parliamentary Services Amendment Bill, which originated in the Senate and is now here in this House."
"I am genuinely delighted to have the opportunity to debate this bill. It gives me and other members of the opposition an opportunity to highlight the problems that the Labor Party has had with this very important policy area. This bill gives expression to quite a mea culpa from the Labor Party. This is because the government is playing catch-up with a B-grade copy of coalition policy. It is very good to see the current Home Affairs minister, Minister Clare, having had completely overridden the former Home Affairs minister, Minister O'Connor, and effectively repudiated Mr O'Connor's quite embarrassing attempts, in 2011, to slag and bag the opposition's approach on the issue we are debating today. It has taken the Labor Party over a year to recognise that a better way was needed in anti-dumping administration, to follow the coalition's lead in moving responsibility away from the International Trade Remedies branch of customs. Eventually, it finally got there. For a party with all the resources of government at its disposal to have taken so long and so laboriously to get to that point, with only a B-grade copy of coalition policy, can manufacturers, the agricultural sector or the Australian public expect this government to deliver the policy, details and personnel that are required for a robust and effective anti-dumping regime? Of course not. How could they? This is the government that cannot deliver free fluff in people's roofs without causing disasters. No doubt it has cost the government a lot of money to get to a similar position as the opposition. What it needed to do was go through some sort of charade. It went through an unnecessary process of appointing yet another failed Labor premier, John Brumby, to another nice little earner in the process, to oversee a review of whether there should be a change in the body that administers the anti-dumping regime. It should have come a long way since ministers O'Connor and Emerson said all sorts of inaccurate things about coalition policy in their panic not to be seen as lagging behind in this very important policy area of anti-dumping. One of the key parts of that policy was to have a greater focus on anti-dumping investigations and to commit more funding to additional resourcing of the system. I might take this opportunity to highlight some of the things that were said at the time by then Minister O'Connor. He said, on 28 November 2011, 'It is not practical, as the opposition proposes, to expect employees of an agency to have the skills to tackle every fact or situation that may present itself.' So what have we got? This bill is creating a new agency, the anti-dumping commission, and moving it from Canberra to Melbourne. This is a new agency. And yet we do not hear any apologies from Minister O'Connor. We had another criticism at the time, when Minister O'Connor said, 'The opposition's headline reform'â€”and I interrupt here as it was not our one headline reform; we have announced many policies in this important area to assist manufacturing and will announce many moreâ€”'was to do a bureaucratic soft-shoe shuffle befitting Yes Minister, moving responsibility for investigations from Customs to the department of industry.' He has criticised it as a non-important policy, yet claimed it was a headline reform for the opposition. What did we have last year, on 4 December, when the government accepted the Brumby recommendations to create this new agency? We had another big headline announcement, with ministers Clare and Combet and Prime Minister Gillard. What they have criticised the opposition for doing, they are quite happy to do themselves. These are the sorts of cheap stunts and attacks that the Australian public are absolutely sick of. We know that the anti-dumping regime in Australia has had significant problems. It has been unworkable with excessive costs and time. There has been difficulty for those wanting to pursue an anti-dumping applications to access the system. These concerns have been voiced to us by industry for a long time. I have been shadow minister in this portfolio for just over three years. It was an important priority for us and we came up with a comprehensive world's-best-practice policy back in 2011. The government has panicked, followed suit and introduced a whole series of bills regarding anti-dumping, trying to play catch-up. We have not opposed those bills, as we will not oppose these ones. Our approach has been to genuinely consult industryâ€”to understand and feel the anxiety and difficulty it has had in accessing a system that did not work. We set up a task force of frontbenchers, we consulted extensively and from that we drafted our policy. I am quite satisfied that the coalition has set the agenda in this very important area. When the coalition starts getting accolades from the trade union movement for the initiative it takes in policy, as happened in this area of anti-dumping, you know that the Labor Party is very embarrassed about its inability to listen to industry's concerns of the day. What we see here is the moving of responsibility for anti-dumping from the International Trade Remedies section of Customs to a separate, new anti-dumping commission based in Melbourne. We heard Minister O'Connor say, back when he was criticising the opposition, that it was just bureaucratic reshuffling to move the administration of it to another section. Then we had the hypocrisy and the waste of money of paying a failed Labor premier to conduct an inquiry to come to a similar conclusion. That occurred last year when the government announced that it was going to establish the Anti-Dumping Commission and commit $24.4 million to the new commission as funding. We do not know where this funding is coming from, and given past practice it is quite possible that this money has againâ€”as has occurred in the pastâ€”been found from cost shifting within Customs. So the opposition will be looking very closely at where these funds are coming from and whether they have indeed been shifted from elsewhere in Customsâ€”an arm of government that has suffered serious stress because of extraordinary, historic ineptitude in border control by this government. We have seen many other cuts to the Customs budget by the Labor government over recent years, and they implied on a number of occasions throughout 2011â€”and again in 2012â€”that they had made changes during those years to increase the number of staff working on anti-dumping cases. They said at the time that they were increasing staff from 31 to 45, but later it emerged that these changes were not based on extra financial investment in the system but were merely predicated on the redeployment of resources from other areas of Customs. Indeed Minister O'Connor had invoked that renowned British series Yes Minister, but perhaps he should look closer to home for a more appropriate application of life imitating art. We know that Australian manufacturing is facing very challenging times. But, unlike the government, we are not going to pretend that the government has no role. The first and primary role of government is to ensure that it removes those things that do damage to business and to manufacturing because of its policies. That is absolutely a first principle. We have not seen the government adopt any policies or any statements that acknowledge or accept responsibility for policies that are doing harm to manufacturers. There is the carbon tax, with increased energy costs and extraordinary, historic escalation of regulatory costs. Just speak to any business sector and you will hear that. There is work to do in those areas as well. In this area of anti-dumping, there should be a proactive approach. In having a system that did not work for so long, it was doing harm by giving a false sense of security that there was a mechanism to ensure that dumped goods were adequately dealt with and there were appropriate duties placed on them. So, although the Labor Party has taken some time to follow the policy initiatives of the coalition, we have supported legislation in this House in making improvements to the anti-dumping regime. We do not have complete faith that this government can deliver the world-class anti-dumping regime that this nation deserves and that exists in other jurisdictions like the United States of America and the EU. We need a world-class anti-dumping administration because we are an open economy, and we take great pride in being an open economy, and that is why legislative regimes like anti-dumping need to actually work and not just exist to give the false sense of security that there is something in place. We saw the new minister's, Minister Clare's, tacit recognition that his ministerial predecessor Mr O'Connor was wrong to criticise the coalition's proposal to move administrative responsibility for anti-dumping away from the International Trade Remedies Branch of Customs and that such a shift should, in fact, be initiated. If only others in the government could follow the lead of coalition policy, perhaps there could be some redemption for this government for the damage that they have inflicted on industry and manufacturing. Sadly, I doubt that will happen, but I do want to assure manufacturing workers, the manufacturing sector and Australians listening to the debate on this bill that the coalition is committed to a strong five-pillar economyâ€”of which manufacturing is an important pillar. We do that because we understand that, in order to have a strong, growing, diversified economy, manufacturing is important. That is why we will not stand for other nations and other companies dumping goods in our jurisdiction below cost when our manufacturers are doing it tough. They are being slugged with a tax, the carbon tax, that is not applied to imported manufactured goods. They are being slugged with additional regulatory costs, unprecedented in our history. They are being slugged by a poor outlook for our economy. Confidence is at record lows, and can you blame people for lacking confidence in the sideshow that is this government? They are suffering. Yes, there are tough international economic conditions, but the actions of this government make it even harder for workers. So, in the months ahead, and leading into the next federal election, I hope that the voice of manufacturing workers, their families and the communities who have sufferedâ€”who have laboured under the damaging policies of this governmentâ€”stand up and are heard. We hear, time and time again, from the government, stunts and announcements just to fill the void of the 24-hour media cycle. Then a year later it all fizzles away. We had an announcement last year during the budget about a new manufacturing technology innovation centre, and how this was the answer for manufacturing. There was much fanfare about $29.8 million. Guess what?â€”it has not materialised. There is not even a hole in the ground. There is nothing; it was just another stunt. So I say to those Australians who are concerned about the future of manufacturing: do not listen to the empty promises. Do not listen to the stunts and the announcements. Look at the track record of this government. There will be more stuntsâ€”I can promise you that!â€”and there will be fanfare. There will be grandiose motherhood statements but the government have not been able to deliver on basic policies for manufacturing. And they will not deliver the economic growth and the economic conditions and policies within which manufacturing can not only survive but flourish."
"Since the early 1980s there has been an almost bipartisan position in this parliament that Australia's best interests lay in being an open trading nation. It has been the reason that we can now purchase a TV set for less than we could 20 years ago. It is the reason that we now are able to purchase computers and all manner of other electronic goods for a fraction of what were able to 10 years ago. It is the reason many Australian working families can afford to have multiple pairs of shoes for their children. When I was growing up if you had more than two pairs of shoes, you were considered to be a wealthy kid. The benefits of having open trade and being an open trading nation have not been without cost. It is absolutely true to say that an open and freer trading arrangement has also been a source of enormous dislocation and restructuring within our own economies, within our manufacturing industries and within our agricultural industries. It is also true to say that those changes have had greater impact on some regions than others. As a trading nation we understand that it is in the broad interest to engage with the rest of the world and enjoy the benefits of open trade. However, as the minister said in his second reading speech, there are some things that cannot be accepted as part of an open trading scheme, and one of them is cheatingâ€”bending the rules. Dumping is cheating. It is not free trade; it is not fair trade; it is an abuse of the system. Industries, companies and workers are injured when goods from overseas are dumped into the Australian market. That is why it is important to ensure that we have a strong, fair and effective dumping regime. Manufacturing employs over one million Australians and is a key part of a broad based Australian economy, and, whilst there has been enormous restructuring in the economic base of the region that I represent, manufacturing is still an important part of the economy and certainly an important source of jobs for workers within my electorate. A more effective anti-dumping system will support jobs in our manufacturing sector by ensuring competition happens on a level playing field. That is why I was so pleased when, on 4 December, the Gillard government announced a package of reforms to Australia's anti-dumping system to deliver stronger protection for Australian industry against unfair competition from overseas. Elements of that new package, which built upon three rafts of reforms that have already been introduced into this parliament, are already assisting Australian industry, but key parts of the new reforms include the establishment of a new anti-dumping commission to investigate complaints, and that is the subject of the bill before the House today. It will further boost funding to Customs by an additional $24.4 million over four years, so that it has the staff, resources and expertise available to deal with cases speedily and fairly. That amount will almost double the resources available in the anti-dumping area of customs. Further, it will make the anti-dumping system easier for small- and medium-sized businesses. It is a key reform for small- and medium-sized businessesâ€”particularly in the fabrication sector in my electorateâ€”that do not have the benefit of in-house lawyers. They are often ably represented by industry associations, but this will make it easier for them to negotiate, to make an application, to keep the doors open until that application is determined. These are key parts of the reforms. The bill will also introduce stricter remedies against overseas producers who deliberately circumvent Australia's anti-dumping rules. Those remedies include the capacity to apply for retrospective penalties from the date when an application is made. These are important reforms. Establishing a new commission under legislation was a primary recommendation of the review into Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing system by the Hon. John Brumby, the former Victorian Premier and treasurer. The Brumby report found that in the last 12 months prevailing economic circumstancesâ€”including the strong Australian dollar, surplus product on world markets and increased competitionâ€”have led to the number of new investigations more than tripling over the past two years. Mr Brumby also found that this trend is likely to continue with the expectation that applications for anti-dumping and countervailing measures will continue to rise. The government has recognised that as global economic circumstances changeâ€”and Australia is facing intense and in some cases unfair international competition from dumped goodsâ€”more needs to be done to ensure that Australia continues to have an effective anti-dumping system. In many respects this package of measures assists in bringing Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing provisions in line with those of our major trading partners and with the new context in international trade. The government has recognised that, as global economic circumstances change and Australia is facing intense and in some cases unfair international competition from dumped goods, more needs to be done. The new reforms will deliver stronger protection for Australian industry against unfair competition from overseas and, in addition to the significant streamlining reforms to Australia's anti-dumping system which were announced in 2011, will provide some relief, particularly in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The bill represents the next step in the Gillard government's support for manufacturers where dumping is injuring local producersâ€”the creation of an Australian anti-dumping commission. Establishing an anti-dumping commission will increase the profile, status and priority of the anti-dumping system. The commission will be principally located in Melbourne and is expected to commence in July this year. The bill also amends the Customs Act to create the role of and set out the matters in relation to the commission. The commission will be responsible for decision making and other anti-dumping related functions that currently rest with the CEO of the Customs and Border Protection agency. The establishment of this commission will ensure a high level of decision making and reflect the significance of the anti-dumping system in Australia. It will not, however, change or alter the responsibility of the minister in his determination powers in respect of anti-dumping matters. The bill also amends the Customs Administration Act to allow the CEO of Customs to delegate to the commissioner powers to disclose certain information to the extent that those powers apply in connection to paragraph 15 (2) (b) of the act and provide that the prohibition of disclosure of certain information will also apply to the commissioner. Finally, as the commission will be established as part of the Customs and Border Protection agency, the bill amends the Criminal Code Act and Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act to ensure that the commissioner is treated consistently with the CEO and Customs officers. This means that, like all Customs staff, the commissioner will be subject to a range of integrity measures, including drug and alcohol testingâ€”although I hope that is never necessaryâ€”the mandatory requirements to report serious misconduct and termination for serious misconduct. Importantly, Labor's tough new anti-dumping measures have been strongly welcomed by Australian manufacturers, including the largest manufacturer in my electorateâ€”BlueScope in Port Kemblaâ€”and the Australian Steel Institute. In Australia it is not a secret that steelmakers have had to make a series of tough decisions to restructure, reduce costs and refocus on the domestic steel market. In the case of BlueScope in Port Kembla, this situation has meant large-scale redundancies and big reductions in spending, including the closure of one of its two blast furnaces at the Port Kembla plant. These changes mean that BlueScope will focus on supplying the domestic market, which is around 2.6 million tonnes per annum. To put that into perspective, China now produces something in the vicinity of four to 4.5 million tonnes per month, which is about twice Australia's annual output. They are producing more than twice as much in any one month as we produce in an entire year. This is important in a business which is all about scale. With global growth still in the doldrums, the oversupply of steel is growing. It is growing on a monthly basis because many of these plants simply do not have the same responsiveness to market pressures as our steelmaking plants in Australia. The Chinese government, for example, have estimated that they have around 150 million tonnes of excess steelmaking capacity. Other analysts put this excess capacity somewhere in the vicinity of over 200 million tonnes. That means that a whole heap of excess steel is going to be pushed onto the international market. We need to ensure that, when steel from other steelmakers around the globe enters international markets, it does so in accordance with the rules of fair and free trade, and that it is not dumped here. These new measures will support local steel industry jobs in the Illawarra and beyond. This new anti-dumping approach is about fairness. We do not allow unfair trade practices by our own businesses and we should not allow Australian jobs to be jeopardised by unfair trade practices from overseas. These rules for free trade are set out in the general agreement on trade and other bilateral agreements. These rules allow signatories to impose corrective measures to respond to dumping of goods and certain subsidies, known as countervailing measures. The World Trade Organization oversees the rules, and in Australia there is also oversight by the courts. Some in debates such as this argue that the imposition of corrective measures or an effective tariff in response to dumping is a retreat to protectionism, that the efficient allocation of resources in Australia simply props up inefficient industries. Others in the debate go even further and argue that, if a company or a country is willing to subsidise Australian consumers by selling us goods which are heavily subsidised or at below cost, then we should just grab this with both hands. I argue, and the Australian government argues, that this is very short-sighted. Importing goods at below cost might provide some short-term windfalls for some consumers but this comes at the price of long-term headwinds for open trade; what the Productivity Commission describes in its reports on our anti-dumping and countervailing measures system as 'a system preserving benefits of our anti-dumping regime'. Put simply, the factory worker who loses his job and the farmer who loses access to a local market will turn their sights on a bigger target: the whole system of open trade itself. So, without these measures, and without the capacity for us to turn to local workers, local businesses and industry as a whole and say that we have a free but fair system of trade rules, we lose confidence in the whole system of open trade. Australian manufacturers know that competing on price alone in this global marketplace is not easy. It is harder still when companies sell their goods at below cost with the objective of injuring a domestic producer and wiping out a whole market. As a country with a strong commitment to free trade, Australia cannot be seen as a soft touch for those seeking to dump their goods into our markets. As I said at the outset, strong anti-dumping measures are about fairness and they are a buttress for a free trade system. This government has shown a strong commitment to our manufacturing sector by these and other measures. We believe in the future of Australian manufacturing, which still employs around one million workers more than the mining and resources sector. Open trade remains a cornerstone of our economy, but to ensure the integrity of our global market in which we trade our goods, we also need to continue to ensure Australia has a tough and responsive anti-dumping system, to ensure that our policy meets its national as well as its international objectives. I commend the legislation to the House."
"It is good to be given an opportunity to discuss this important and critical issue of dumping, to provide an update on some of the prevailing issues and to consider their relevance to the establishment of an independent agency with the responsibility for monitoring and combating dumping in Australia, as this bill seeks to do. Dumping is an important issue of concern across many sectors in the Australian economy. That is reflected by the fact that this House has considered some five tranches of legislative improvements over the term of this parliament. However, I must state that this piece of legislation before us today is certainly somewhat better than the piecemeal approach contained in the previous tranches of legislation this parliament has dealt with over the past 48 months. What we see before us in this legislation is a bill to give effect to the establishment of an Australian anti-dumping commission, with funding of $24.4 million over the forward estimates. However, there remains the question of the source of this money, and I am yet to hear a clear indication from any government speaker about how this will be funded. Hopefully, the minister will enlighten those listening to this debate when he makes his speech in reply. I feel compelled to note my surprise at this move, the most coherent and direct of this Labor government's attempts to deal with the issue of dumping, to establish a dedicated agency to deal with the problem. Of course, the former minister responsible criticised this very policy when the coalition announced a very similar policy last year, with the coalition's anti-dumping task force. So the government seems to have achieved a degree of clarity in this fundamental policy area, which is good, albeit piggybacking on a previously announced coalition plan. Once again, we see the coalition taking the lead from opposition. The government certainly must feel embarrassed following their relentless negativity and hysterical response to the coalition's anti-dumping policy, which they now seek to copy. Indeed, at the very height of their shrill response to its release, the minister for trade, in a performance comparable to his off-key singing, said the coalition's policy indicated a 'willingness to breach the world trading rules and tear up trade agreements with neighbouring Asian countries'. Now Labor seek to adopt almost that very policy for themselves. Quite an embarrassment indeed. Another point that is interesting to note was the necessity for the Labor government to hire an old Labor mate to draw up these recommendations. It is just another example of Labor waste, but you have to ask how Mr Brumby earned his pay cheque. It was not hard because he could have got this entire policy by downloading it from the Liberal Party website. We might ask ourselves: why has the government decided to finally copy many parts of the coalition's policy? Perhaps it has something to do with other government policies that have made Australian manufacturing uncompetitive, such as the government's carbon tax. By imposing a carbon tax on Australian manufacturers when such a tax is not levied upon our foreign competitors, we are simply putting our Australian businesses at a competitive disadvantage. It is natural that many of these companies with all these high costs of producing goods onshore in Australia are seeing goods produced offshore flooding into the country at prices lower than they can manufacture them at. It is not because they are doing anything wrong or because their business models are uncompetitive; it is simply because this Labor government is burdening them with taxes and extra expenses that they have to pay but overseas competitors do not. Is it any wonder that we have seen hundreds of thousands of job losses in the manufacturing sector under this Labor government? I would like to correct something that the good member for Throsby said. He mentioned that dumping is selling below cost. That is not correct. According to the World Trade Organization's definition, dumping is not simply selling goods below cost and nor is it selling them for an anticompetitive purpose. The World Trade Organization's definition of dumping includes merely selling a good at a lower price in a foreign market than what is charged for that same good in the exporter's domestic market. Effectively, anti-dumping legislation attempts to ensure that a company makes the same levels of profit in the export market as it does in the domestic market. We need to be careful that this legislation does not set off trade disputes with other countries. There is hardly an exporter in Australia also selling their goods on the local market that does not go in with a slightly sharper pencil when competing in more competitive overseas markets. Under World Trade Organization rules, that could be deemed as dumping. When it is all boiled down, dumping is merely geographic price discrimination on an international basisâ€”selling the same good in different markets, segmenting those markets by international boundaries and charging different prices. If speaker after speaker on both sides of this parliament comes in here and condemns international geographic price discrimination, we also must condemn geographic price discrimination when it occurs within our borders, especially when it causes or threatens to cause material injury to an Australian business. If we fail to do so, if we fail to include geographic price discrimination in our own laws, we are nothing more than hypocrites. For while it is important to have an effective law to deal with geographic price discrimination when it occurs across political boundaries and internationally, it is equally important to have such a law when it occurs within Australiaâ€™s regional boundaries. In the home of free-market capitalism, the USA, the Robinson-Patman Act has a specific provision to deal with geographic price discrimination within America. That act says in part: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce â€¦ to sell, or contract to sell, goods in any part of the United States at prices lower than those exacted by said person elsewhere in the United States for the purpose of destroying competition, or eliminating a competitor. These competition laws simply do not exist in Australia. Where we experience geographic price discrimination within our boundaries, affecting regional parts of Australia, we simply have no provisions to deal with that, but there are provisions in place for goods that come from overseas. We need to address both issues. We should not be concerned only about goods being sold substantially below cost or below the cost at which they are sold in international markets. Another issue this parliament should be addressing is the reverse of international geographic price discrimination; it is what you could almost call international price gouging. One only has to look at the higher prices paid by consumers and businesses in Australia for goods that are available much more cheaply overseas. I will give a couple of examples. In the Adelaide Advertiser today is an article titled 'The great Aussie pricing disparity'. Under the heading 'Highway robbery' were listed several items that Australian consumers pay higher prices for because firms are engaging in international geographic price discrimination against Australia, charging much higher prices in the Australian market. A stunning example is Levi's 501 jeans. News Limited analysis is that Levi's 501 jeans in Australia sell for $109.95, yet those same jeans are available in the USA for $62.18. So Australian consumers are paying almost 50 per cent more. We need to ask: what is the cause of this higher price? Is it the manufacturer overseas? Is it Levi's engaging in international geographic price discrimination? Or is it a lack of competition in the Australian market? These are the issues we should be looking at in this parliament. Another example is Colgate toothpaste. While consumers in America pay a little over $2, it is $3.15 in Australian supermarketsâ€”again 50 per cent higher. Again we should be asking: what is the cause of this discrepancy? It does not stop with those products. A two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola sells for $3.79 in Australian supermarkets. That Coke is made using the same method around the world in highly efficient automated plants. Yet last year, when I was on a delegation to Taiwan, at a small 7/11 supermarket that same two-litre bottle of Coke was selling for the equivalent of $1. You only have to look online and you can see that same two-litre bottle of Coke being sold in the USA today for around $1 to $1.20â€”yet it sells in Australia for $3.79. So we need to ask ourselves: is Coca Cola engaging in international geographic price discrimination against Australia? Or is it a lack of competition in the Australian market? A few other examples of geographic price discrimination, or reverse dumping, in Australia are in our tech sector, for IT products. A few examples have been drawn to my attention of how Australians are paying much higher prices. It is not only Australian consumers; it is Australian businesses as well, which puts those businesses at a competitive disadvantage. For example, for Creative Cloud, from Adobeâ€”which is something you actually buy online, so there are no additional distribution costs whether they are selling it here or in the USAâ€”Australian consumers pay $62.99 whereas in the USA they only pay $50. A worse example is Adobe CS6 Master Collection, again something you can buy online, so there is no additional costs of distributionâ€”we cannot argue about any different cost in freight. If I were a US citizen I could buy it for $2,599. But if I am based here in Australia, and I download exactly the same item, Adobe will charge me $4,344. That is almost 50 to 60 per cent higher in price. The same goes for Microsoft. An example: Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium to Professional upgradeâ€”again, a product that can be downloaded, so there are no different costs to Microsoft in whichever market they sell. As a citizen of the US I could download that and pay $89.95. But downloading that in Australia I pay $104.99â€”more than 20 per cent more. These are some of the issues we need to look at. If we are going to look at international geographic price discrimination, where goods are being sold too cheaply in Australia, we should also look at the complete reverseâ€”where Australian consumers and Australian businesses are paying higher prices, because that makes us uncompetitive. In my few remaining minutes, I would also like to draw the attention of the House to how some of the anti-dumping regulations can actually be used against consumers and against industry and be ineffective. The example I would like to give is bedroom furniture, and the dumping regulations that were applied in the USA from Chinese bedroom furniture manufacturers. Since 2004 the US Department of Commerce imposed strict anti-dumping penalties on wooden bedroom furniture that was imported from China, deeming that those products had been dumped into the US market for less than their fair value. These products had an additional tariff on them from one per cent to more than 200 per cent of the import value. But this did not save the US furniture manufacturing sector. Despite these dumping duties the US have seen a massive decline in jobs in the furniture industry, a massive decline in the number of local sales and imports take up to 80 per cent of the marketâ€”a complete reversal. So we need to be very careful and not overplay these anti-dumping regulations, because sometimes they can be used against our industries. Also, there are many Australian companies that rely on components in their production chain, that produce those goods here in Australia. We have to be careful that, as these anti-dumping regulations come in, they are not adversely affected and there are not delays or additional costs put on those companiesâ€” (Time expired)"
"I rise to speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Commission) Bill 2013, and I welcome its introduction into the House. Dumping is becoming a major problem for Australian manufacturing industries and for Australian farmers and food producers. It will continue to be a problem, and become a more serious problem in the future, because of a changing global economy. The global economic downturn, and the widening gap between the cost of labour in Australia when compared with labour costs in many other countries, is going to continue to cause problems for industries within Australia. The global economic downturn has also led to two serious affects for Australian manufacturing and food-growers. Firstly, the value of the Australian dollar has risen in response to Australia's more stable and stronger economy. Secondly, consumption has fallen across many countries, resulting in an overproduction of products and little demand for them from their previous markets. Australia is seen as a secure country in which to off-load goods when previous markets have dried up. It is also seen as a country to dump goods by industries whoâ€”because of the global financial downturnâ€”are in financial difficulty and having a fire sale of their products. In response to those threats, in June 2011 the government announced a series of reforms to protect Australian industries and Australian jobs. These were the most significant Customs reforms in more than a decade. The reforms will result in better access to the anti-dumping system, faster remedies and faster decisions, improved quality of decision making, greater consistency with other countries and stronger compliance with anti-dumping measures. Under the reforms a new anti-dumping commission will be established to investigate dumping complaints, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our anti-dumping system. The anti-dumping system will be made easier for small- and medium-sized businesses to use; including by providing further funding for the International Trade Remedies Adviser to provide information, advice and support to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Funding to Customs will be increased by $24.4 million so that it has the resources to deal with cases speedily and fairly, include almost doubling the number of investigators. Higher dumping duties can be imposed in cases where significant numbers of Australian small- or medium-sized enterprises are being injured by dumped goods. There will be speedier reviews, stronger remedies and higher penalties in cases where overseas producers or importers do not comply with, or deliberately circumvent, Australia's anti-dumping rules. This bill implements three specific reforms. Firstly, the bill amends the definition of subsidy to more accurately reflect the language of article 1 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and to clarify that a subsidy is a financial contribution, income or price support that confers a benefitâ€”whether directly or indirectlyâ€”in relation to the goods exported to Australia. The bill introduces a new section to provide that, where a countervailable subsidy has been received in respect of goods, the amount of the countervailable subsidy is determined by the minister in writing and should be worked out by reference to the units of those goods. Secondly, the bill has amendments to deal with circumvention activities. Circumvention is a trade strategy used by the exporters and importers of products to avoid the full payment of dumping and countervailing duties. Circumvention behaviours take various forms, but they all aim to ensure that goods do not attract the intended dumping or countervailing duty. This bill will allow the minister to amend the original notice imposing the dumping or countervailing duty, including by extending the notice so that it applies to different goods, exporters and countries which were not specified in the original notice. Thirdly, the bill deals with noncooperation in relation to dumping investigations, reviews or continuation inquiries. Schedule 3 also clarifies the provisions that deal with sampling in relation to dumping and countervailable subsidy inquiries and consolidates them into one provision. Sampling is currently undertaken for dumping and subsidy investigations. Sampling is also undertaken where the number of exporters who provide information is so large as to make a determination for each individual exporter impracticable. The minister may limit his or her examination to a selected number of exporters who are a statistically valid sample or who are responsible for the largest percentage of the volume of exports from the country in question that can reasonably be investigated. Dumping is destroying Australian businesses and Australian jobs. Often when those jobs and industries are lost, they are lost forever. Competing on a level playing field is one thing, but competing with products that are sold below cost is another. That is what is happening. That is why this legislation is timely and why it will be welcomed by Australian industry and Australian workers. I have had several representations about this matter from industries and residents within my electorate. One of the manufacturing industries that is currently being directly affected by alleged dumping is Tindo Solar, located in Mawson Lakes in the Makin electorate. I understand that Tindo is Australia's sole manufacturer of solar panels. The company began production in November 2011 and was officially opened by Prime Minister Julia Gillard on 26 October last year. At the time, Prime Minister Gillard, the Premier of South Australia, the Hon. Jay Weatherill, the Minister for Industry and Innovation, the Hon. Tom Koutsantonis, and I attended the official opening and were given a tour of the facilities. It is indeed an impressive manufacturing plant that I have no doubt can compete with plants around the world. Tindo manufactures what the company refers to as 'technologically advanced, high-performing solar panels' and claims that it can compete with the real cost of solar panels that are being manufactured in China and other places. However, because of the glut of panels across the worldâ€”particularly in Chinaâ€”that are being dumped below cost on the Australian market, Tindo believes they are no longer competing on a fair and level playing field. They are confident of competing against real costs of manufacture but not when products are then sold below cost. That appears to be happening with respect to solar panels and, not surprisingly, we have seen the cost of panels come down in Australia. I suspect that part of the reason for that is because the allegations made by Tindo Solar are in fact true and that panels are being dumped on the Australian market at below cost. Proving that products are sold below cost is extremely difficult, particularly when those products are manufactured offshore in a country where we have no ability to carry out investigations. Last year BlueScope Steel made similar claims about cheap imported steel coming in from Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Malaysia, affecting production at the BlueScope Port Kembla plant and resulting in job losses. The member for Throsby referred to this matter in his own comments about this bill. Similar claims were made about paper imports from Indonesia and China and the effects they were having on the timber and pulp industries in the south-east of South Australia. I am well aware of the campaign that was raised at the time to try to prevent those cheap imports from coming in, because it was directly affecting output from the plants in the south-east of South Australia and in turn having a direct effect on South Australian jobs. Concerns are also affecting our nation's food producers, and the member for Murray quite rightly referred to this concern. I have had several discussions with food producers who are not only competing at times with food produced overseas and being sold, in Australia or overseas, below cost but competing with food grown in countries where growers are provided with government tax breaks or government subsidies that do not apply here in Australia. Only last Sunday I spoke to a well-known South Australian winemaker, who raised with me his concerns about the unfair competition Australian winemakers are now facing from overseas produced wine. The unfairness relates not only to the Australian market but to overseas markets that Australian winemakers were previously exporting to. Trying to stamp out dumping of products in Australia is one thing; competing with them when they are being dumped in a market in another country, but a market that our own producers have relied on in the past, is anotherâ€”and perhaps a much more difficult matter to deal with. Nevertheless, it is happening. And it is happening because right now, as a result of the global financial crisis, there are companies around the world that are seeking to offload their productsâ€”products that in many cases they have in storage and are holding on to at below cost in order to recoup some money on them. Additionally, our growers are continually having to compete with an oversupply of products resulting from good seasons in other countries. That is another concern that is very difficult to control but that nevertheless sees products being dumped both here in Australia and overseas in markets where growers are competing to have their products sold. In fact, I have also spoken with several fresh food growers and vegetable growers who are telling me that they equally are now facing serious difficulty as a result of fresh food coming into this country. There is no question in their minds that these products are being sold in Australia below cost. This legislation will not resolve all the problems I have eluded to, but it is indeed a step in the right direction. It is a step that, as I said at the outset, industries and workers in this country will welcome. It is a step that closes some of the gaps, some of the holes, and enables Australia to better control products that are coming into the country and being sold at below cost. It is a step that does a great deal to protect the jobs of Australian people and the businesses that employ those people. In my own electorate there are about 8,000 people who work in manufacturing. Manufacturing is one of the industry sectors that is most at risk as a result of products being dumped into this country. If this legislation can act in any way to safeguard any of the industries or the jobs of those 8,000 people I refer toâ€”or in fact the one million around the country who are also employed in manufacturingâ€”then it will be worthwhile. I commend the legislation to the House."
"I would like to take the opportunity in this adjournment debate to continue some comments I was making on the tabling of a report of the parliamentary delegation last year to the UK and Poland. I had time to discuss the UK experience and relationship but I certainly did not have enough time to do justice to the experiences in Poland. Poland is a fascinating country. It is reaching out strongly to Australia. It wants an improved relationship with Australia. It looks at Australia, praises our economic management through the global financial crisis, considers us a small country that has a significant role to play on the international stage. It sees Australia as having influence. Poland sees itself as being very similar to Australia. Poland joined the European Union in 2004, and it is the sixth largest country by population in the European Union, but it did not ever join the economic zone. It has had a particularly successful economic experience. We were fortunate to meet with members of their equivalent of the Reserve Bankâ€”their national bankâ€”and speak to them about their economy. Poland's banking sector is reasonably young, only beginning in the late 1980s. It certainly experienced early crises but it escaped the global financial crisis, partly because it was not part of the economic zone just yet. That meant that Poland's currency, the zloty, depreciated after the financial crisis, which kept their export sector internationally competitive. Poland has shown great economic resilience. By constitution only six per cent of their GDP can be debt. Australia has one of the lowest debt ratiosâ€”I think it is still about 25 per centâ€”but Poland has a dictated six per cent maximum. It is also a country reaching out in trade. It was a founding member for the World Trade Organisation in 1995. I must say that trade was one of the most interesting areas that we experienced. Our ambassador, Ambassador Dunn, has a trade background and I could see the work she was doing in embracing opportunities for our country and for Poland. In my own electorate two Polish companies now own Inbye Mining Services and Waratah Engineering. It was wonderful for us to see our economic relationship growing. In the delegation we were very fortunate that many cultural and heritage opportunities were put our way. We started off in Krakow. That was an experience in itself, but going to Auschwitz and Birkenau was truly amazing. We went there with the member for Melbourne Ports and his wife, who are of the Jewish faith and that was a very moving experience. It certainly reminded me how blessed we are in this nation. We are blessed to have sectarian and racial harmony and to have a country full of peace. We went to the old villages and the old cities of Krakow and Warsaw and to the Warsaw Jewish museum. I would almost say to every MP: 'Please go. It puts our lives and our plight into context.' We saw the World Heritage salt mines and we saw how ordinary working people spend some time carving magnificent masterpieces. It is a tribute to working people. Poland has a working history and a union history that it is very proud of. In fact, the President was recognised for his work in that movement by the Polish people. When we were at Auschwitz it was interesting to hear the guideâ€”a guide who does that trip over and over againâ€”and to sense his anger. I spoke to him afterwards and I said, 'You are so angry about this, still.' He said, 'Yes, because of business exploitation of that situation,' because he knew that people made an industry selling off the clothing and that there were industries based on the chemicals for the poisons that were used at Auschwitz. The hair of dead people was used to weave into carpets. It was quite horrific. But I am very grateful to have been part of the delegation. I thank all of the staff involved, and Tim Bryant, Meredith Horne, President Hogg and fellow delegates. (Time expired)"
"There is little disagreement with the proposition that the Labor government under successive prime ministers, Rudd and Gillard, have mismanaged the economy: record budget deficits, including the four largest in Australia's history, 27 new taxes and numerous examples of waste and mismanagement comprise exhibits A, B and C. Perhaps most damaging of all has been the government's erratic decision making processes that have lacked consultation, alienated stakeholders and produced policy outcomes inimical to the very interests they pretended to protect. Nowhere is this more evident than when it comes to superannuationâ€”the retirement savings that every Australian seeks to grow. Despite promising at the 2007 election that there would be no changes to superannuation the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, has overseen successive tax increases on superannuation, thereby not just breaking his solemn promise but making it that much more difficult for millions of Australians, young and old, to save for their future. Facing a $120 billion black hole of unfunded promises, the Treasurer has increased taxes to the tune of $8 billion on superannuation in this country. The Labor government has decreased concessional contribution caps from $100,000 and $50,000 to $25,000, with contributions above that taxed at the top marginal tax rate of 46.5 per cent. And the super co-contribution has been cut from $1,500 under the Howard Government to $500 now. And there is more to comeâ€”the Prime Minister recently ruled out removing the tax-free superannuation payments for over-60s, but only after a public outcry. Given this government's record of broken promises over the carbon tax, private health insurance and border protection, how can we expect to believe they would stick to anything they say should they win the next election? But, significantly, unlike the coalition, which has ruled out any detrimental unexpected changes to superannuation, this government refuses to rule out further changes. In fact, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, was reported in The Australian on 29 November 2012 as telling superannuation funds in a private meeting that: 'Nothing was off the table.' This is all a desperate attempt to protect the government's budget bottom line. This is despite senior industry figures like the Industry Funds Management chairman, Garry Weaven, saying it is 'time for a pause' on super changes and former Labor minister Nick Sherryâ€”he was superannuation minister from 2007 to 2009â€”issuing a warning. The Labor Party is desperate: a structural deficit and a $120 billion budget black hole requires the government to find savings anywhere it can. When it comes to superannuation, the union leadership is egging them on. ACTU Assistant Secretary Tim Lyons has said of the changes to superannuation: I don't buy the argument that a slight change to tax is going to discourage people from planning for their retirement. This is not what the majority of Australians think. They want the freedom to invest in their super and to take responsibility for their retirement without being punished with punitive tax imposts put in place by a desperate government. Should the coalition win the federal election later this year, we have said that, when the budget is back in a healthy state, we will revisit the issue of concessional superannuation contribution caps and super co-contribution benefits for lower income earners, which are currently at levels below where they should be. We have said that we will seek to introduce genuine choice and competition into the selection of default superannuation funds, as the situation is currently dominated by industry super funds. We want any MySuper product to be able to operate freely within the default superannuation market, we want to get more independent directors onto superannuation fund boards, we want disclosure of conflicts of interests to be mandatory and we want to increase the transparency of information for people who are seeking to compare super funds. Superannuation is a really important issue. It is about aspiration, it is about people saving for the future and it is about people taking personal responsibility. We, on this side of the House, understand their needs and we understand the needs of future generationsâ€”unlike the other side. (Time expired)"
"Speaking of the future, if we actually want Australia to succeed in the future in the 21st century, nothing is more important or more critical than ensuring that our kids have the best educational opportunities and educational pathways. Our Labor government, I am proud to say, has sought to strengthen our country's educational security and to provide and support those educational pathways in its Building the Education Revolution, which has improved school facilities at many schools around the country but, most importantly, at 52 schools in my electorate of Holt. This school modernisation program has been absolutely vital to the local community in my electorate. It is providing the necessary educational and very important social infrastructure which is needed for the rapidly growing Casey region, which is currently estimated to be at 252,400 people. At present, about 40 families, or 118 people, shift into the city of Casey each week, 43,800 students are at school, 7,500 students are attending university and 6,600 students are attending TAFE. By 2036, it is estimated that the population of the city of Casey will be about 450,000, which is approximately the size of Tasmania's population today. The projects that we provided during the period of the global financial crisis were quite importantâ€”that was the origin of the BER programâ€”particularly when you think about the global job losses in that period of time, which were about 27 million jobs. That is point that I want to stress because the government acted when we faced the GFC. We acted to protect and create Australian jobs and, at the same time, to invest in our kids' future. In our more globally interconnected and highly competitive world, it is important that governments do what they canâ€”I notice that President Obama was speaking about this todayâ€”to protect and invest in our children and in our future. We need to continue to build the social and educational infrastructure for our children. Young people in our region face many challenges, but they only increase if governments fail to invest in children's education. That is why it is so vital for us to support projects such as the BER program and also the trade training centre program which are providing pathways for our kids into the TAFE sector. It is also why Victorians have been very upset with the Baillieu government's cuts to the TAFE sector, which have seen an incredible 25.8 per cent drop in TAFE applicationsâ€”not tremendously helpful. By contrast, our federal Labor government has been fully committed to supporting our children in their quest to acquire a trade qualification via the trade training centre program. I think this is really important. It is important to state again in this place, particularly for the young people that I represent in my area, that there is no difference in value between a trade certification and a university degree. Labor and I celebrate and support people who pursue a trades career. We need to encourage it. I am also pleased to announce that next Monday I will be officially opening the $10.5 million Hallam Valley Trade Training and Skills Hub at the Hallam Senior Secondary College. It shows our commitment to these young people. It shows them a pathway to the future. The building is very impressive. The trade training centre program was actually first announced by the member for Griffith in his budget reply in May 2007. It has become a signature reform of this particular government. We are doing it to address skill shortages and to provide an extra educational investment for our young people in their transition into the TAFE sector. The Hallam Valley Trade Training and Skills Hub will provide job-ready training in traditional and emerging trades for senior school students at Hallam Senior Secondary College, Fountain Gate Secondary College, Gleneagles Secondary College, Endeavour Hills Secondary College, Hampton Park Secondary College, Narre Warren South P-12 College and St John's Regional College. The trade training centreâ€”which, as I said, is an incredibly impressive buildingâ€”has an automotive workshop, a construction workshop, two theory rooms, two seminar rooms, store rooms, a computer workshop and amenities, and existing facilities that have also been refurbished. It is an investment in our kids' future. You can actually see the trade training centre from the Hallam Bypass, which is another road work that was initiated by the Bracks government. In general, there is a lot of community pride. I am really proud to be opening this centre. It is the government's commitment to the future and it is recognising trade as an incredibly valuable and an important job in our economy. As I said, I will be very proud to open this facility on Monday. House adjourned at 20 : 00"
"I rise this morning to put on the record the tremendous efforts of emergency workers in Moreton Bay and volunteer members of the QF3 Redcliffe Coast Guard during and after the damaging storms, winds and floods experienced throughout Queensland last month. My electorate follows the coastline in the Moreton Bay region, where many local suburbs suffered significant damage. Roads were closed, power was lost and trees came down. The clean-up and repair efforts are ongoing and will be for some time. I know trained SES workers were on the ground immediately in the Moreton Bay region. I would like to recognise their contribution to our community. They were sandbagging, helping residents with damaged houses, removing debris and picking up trees. The SES was established in Queensland in 1975 and provides invaluable support to other emergency services such as police and ambulance. Volunteer members are trained in a range of support activities including storm damage operations, search operations, communications, first aid and operations management. The Moreton Bay region SES unit has six SES groups supporting the community and other agencies in severe storm operations, flood operations, land search operations and agency supportâ€”supporting the Queensland Police Service, the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service and the Queensland Ambulance Service. On behalf of the community, I take this opportunity to say to our SES workers, most of whom are volunteers: thank you for helping to keep us safe. I also acknowledge the efforts of members of QF3 Coast Guard Redcliffe, both during the recent wild weather and in their work during the 2011 Queensland floods. In fact, the commitment and dedication of these volunteers during 2011 was officially recognised at the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard Awards ceremony at Redcliffe on Australia Day this year, just as the next set of storms headed our way. I extend my sincere congratulations to the 13 volunteers who were awarded their National Emergency Medal for their service rendered in response to a national significant emergency. They were: Don Boscoe, Russ Eager, Peter Hackett, Roy King, Paul Klingner, Bart McLeod, John Osberg, Merv Porteous, Alex Robinson, Peter Slaughter, Vince Turco, Col Ward and, posthumously, Tony Burns. It was then straight back to work for members of the QF3 Coast Guard, who spent most of the 2013 Australia Day weekend dealing with storms and tidal surges while our region felt the impact of Cyclone Oswald and rare mini tornadoes. These volunteers deserve our respect and admiration and I am very pleased to be able to recognise them here today. I also recognise the efforts of their counterparts up and down the coastline of Queensland, particularly in Bundaberg, where the city has experienced the worst flooding in its history. Finally, I am looking forward to attending the Rotary International Emergency Services Appreciation Night next week, hosted by the combined Rotary clubs of the Redcliffe Peninsula. This special evening enables our community to show our appreciation and recognition for the contributions made by the Redcliffe emergency service agencies, the leaders of those agencies and the volunteersâ€”those who risk their lives time and again to keep us safe when natural disasters strike."
"I would like to use the opportunity of this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2012-2013 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2012-2013 to express my concern about rising cost-of-living pressures hitting residents in my electorate and across Australia, and to express my dismay that the government's policies are making things worse. As many in this chamber would be aware, essential goods and services have been going up in price way in excess of inflation or indeed wages. People tell me this in my community on a daily or weekly basis, and the stats back this up. The official ABS statistics show that the cost of electricity has gone up by 90 per cent since 2007, water by 64 per cent, gas by 60 per cent, education by 31 per cent and medical and hospital by 38 per cent. In the last 12 months, even childcare costs have gone up by 15 per cent. Cost-of-living pressures are indeed rising, and they are starting to hurt families in a very significant way. I receive correspondence and I receive telephone calls on a very regular basis from people who are struggling to make ends meet because of these price increases. There are many reasons why the cost of living has been going up, but a significant reason in recent years is government policy. I would like to outline in four ways how the government's policy and the government's approach have contributed to the increase in cost-of-living pressures. The first, of course, is by running enormous budget deficits. In the last four years, the government has delivered the four largest budget deficits in Australian political history, and this year there will be a further budget deficit. We know that, if you run large budget deficits, that will have an impact on the cost of living. It is not just me or other members of the coalition who support this particular view. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer themselves have made exactly this point. The Prime Minister said that achieving surplus was 'the best thing that we can do to help families with cost-of-living pressures'. Wayne Swan said: â€¦ meandering back to surplus â€¦ would compound the pressures in our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people. And they are exactly right. By running such huge budget deficits, by continuing to run budget deficits, by abandoning their solemn promise to get the budget back to surplus, they are contributing to higher cost-of-living pressures for every Australian in the nation. The second way the government are contributing to cost-of-living pressures is through specific measures that they have put in place. They introduced the carbon tax, which had an immediate effect on electricity prices and gas prices and, through those two things, every good and service in the nation. Electricity has gone up by at least 10 per cent in the last 12 months alone, and that is entirely due to the introduction of the carbon tax. Gas has gone up by nine per centâ€”also entirely due to the introduction of the carbon tax. How do we know this? Because the government's modelling before they introduced it said that those costs would go up by that amount. So they actually got the forecast right. They knew that costs were going to increase through the carbon tax, and that is exactly what happened. Bear in mind, Mr Deputy Speaker Lyons, that these cost increases are occurring when the carbon tax is at $23 per tonne. As we know, the carbon tax is legislated to increase to $39 per tonne and it is then forecast to increase to an incredible $350 per tonne by 2050. So, a 15-times increase in the carbon tax is expected by this government by 2050. Imagine the impact that is going to have on electricity prices. Healthcare costs are going up because the government is taking the axe to the private health insurance rebate. They promised they would not, but they have already means tested the private health insurance rebate, which flows through to everybody, and they are now proposing a further measure to abandon the ability to claim the additional penalties associated with not taking out private health insurance at the age of 30 against the rebate. Childcare costs have also been increasing directly due to government policy. The government have decided that the staff-to-child ratios in childcare centres must be reduced. They have already been reduced for the nought- to two-year-olds. They will be reduced in future for the two- to four-years-olds. The Productivity Commission looked into this and said, 'If you go ahead, costs will go up by 15 per cent'. The government knew this, but they have gone ahead anyway. And what do you know? Costs have gone up by 15 per cent, and they will continue to go up as the government's proposals roll through to child care for the three- and four-year-olds. The third area where they have put up the cost-of-living pressures is through the taxes that they have imposed. We all know about the government's taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and other products that working people use. They have actually introduced 21 new taxes since they were elected to government in 2007. Some of them are direct taxes on products that people use, but others are taxes on businesses, which then flow through to the products and services that those businesses offer. The fourth area is in regulations. The government have introduced 20,000 new regulations over the five years since they were elected, and they have removed only 200. They promised one in, one out, but they have only removed 200 and have introduced 20,000. What these new regulations do is impose red tape and additional reporting requirements on businesses. What that then means is that business cost structures go up and to recoup those costs they then either have to put up the prices of their services or the goods they manufacture or they have to lay off workers. They are the two choices which they have in order to maintain their profitability. So, in four ways the government have contributed to the cost of living increases: firstly, by running huge budget deficits; secondly, by introducing specific policies which put up costs in certain areasâ€”electricity, gas, child care and private health insurance, for example; thirdly, by putting up particular taxesâ€”21 in all across the board; and fourthly, by imposing 20,000 new regulations which make business costs so much higher, which then flow on to higher costs for the goods and services that those businesses produce. The government like to talk about their concern that prices have been going up, but when you examine what they have been doing they have, in fact, been contributing greatly to those increases in the cost of living. The astounding thing, though, is that when the government then get some political pressure upon them because costs have been increasing so much, their response is not to examine what they have been doing and remove some of the regulations, remove some of the taxes, tweak some of their policies to try to reduce those cost-of-living pressures or try to run budget surpluses. No, their response has been to spend more money on cash splashes. Last week, for example, the government introduced a bill for a further billion dollars of cash splashes to certain constituents in the community. It is all very well that those residents get a small amount of additional cash in the short term, but all of that cash was put on the government's credit card, all of it just contributes to the government's debt, all of it contributes to the government's yearly deficit. Hence we get into this vicious cycle. The government has taken us into debt, which puts up cost-of-living pressures. So the government then allocates some more cash, increasing the debt levels again, which then puts up cost-of-living pressures. And so the cycle continues. If we continue on that cycle the government will go broke. You simply cannot continue to allocate more and more cash and put it on the government credit card. It simply cannot be done. So what should the government be doing to address cost-of-living pressures? It can do a number of things and it can do these things immediately. Firstly, it could get rid of the carbon tax. The carbon tax adds approximately $515 to a family's budget and it reduces business confidence. That would be the first and best thing they could do to reduce cost-of-living pressures on everyday families, including those in my electorate, and it would also be the best thing they could do to support our manufacturers. The second thing they should do is re-examine some of their policies which are increasing pricesâ€”their child-care policies and their attacks on the private health insurance rebate. Third, they should stop adding taxes and, where possible, they should reduce taxes to make it easier for everyday Australians and businesses. Lower taxes are in the coalition's DNA. Higher taxes are in the Labor Party's DNA. The fourth thing they should do is cut the regulations and get rid of the red tape which is starting to strangle our small businesses in particular so that they can grow and have confidence and their cost structures will be lower, which then means we can have lower-cost goods and services out in the community. Fifth, they should have a proper competition review, particularly into supermarkets, where many people have concerns that a lack of competition is contributing to higher prices. That is a list of things the government should be doing. They could be doing those things immediately in order to take the cost-of-living pressures off everyday families. These are some of the things which the coalition will do if we are fortunate enough to be elected to government later this year. The cost-of-living pressures facing families is a very big issue. It is perhaps one of the greatest concerns that residents in my electorate express to me. But what the government have been doing is not alleviating cost-of-living pressures but the reverse. Through their taxes, through their policies and through their enormous budget deficits they have been putting up cost-of-living pressures for everyday families are making it harder for them. We need to be doing the opposite. The coalition has a plan to reduce cost-of-living pressures, to get the budget back into surplus, to address some of those policies which are causing prices to go up and to remove the taxes. Those are the things that we can do if we are elected to government. They should be things that the government do immediately, but they will not. So we do require a change of government at the end of this year to take pressure off everyday families in my electorate and across Australia."
"I am very pleased to contribute to this morning's debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2012-2013 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2012-2013 because appropriations debates are an opportunity to articulate one's vision as a government for the nation, and we certainly have articulated our vision for the nation through funding commitments since coming to office. It is an extraordinary history of investment in infrastructure, in education and in health to benefit communities such as mine in La Trobe. It is extraordinary listening to a member from Victoria whose last contribution was to talk about what a government might do on coming to office. We all know about the 'gonna' government of Ted Baillieuâ€”'woulda, coulda, shoulda'. 'We would, we might, we will at some point,' and then they proceed to dither and do nothing for an entire term. So it is extraordinary to listen to this sentiment, seemingly about national vision. Typically, when the Liberals come to office, we see them stagnate. We see them come to a standstill. We see infrastructure spending come to a standstill. But, worse than that, we see them have a look at things that, hypothetically, a Labor government might have committed to in its term prior to, for instance, a government such as Ted Baillieu's coming to officeâ€”for instance, the funding commitment that has gone to the duplication of Clyde Road. We all know that under this government a funding commitment of around $30 million was made to the duplication of Clyde Road in my electorate. It was supported also by an investment made by the Brumby government for Clyde Road. At the time that those announcements were made, conservatives were very happy. I know the former member for La Trobeâ€”who is now running again, it seemsâ€”was very happy to articulate his concern that this would be a completely ineffective project. People did not want to turn up and congratulate the initiative of this government and the Brumby government in investing in the duplication of a road in one of the growth areas in Melbourne. But now we find that the Victorian minister is very happy to put on a hard hat and a high-vis vest, come out and rebadge this as something that is good for the area and tremendously well supported by the Victorian government. Five minutes earlier it was something that required looking at, required additional work and required some serious thinking, and now, when it is something that is underway and that he and others on the conservative side understand is beneficial for a growing area, they decide that it is something that they want to support. So, if we are talking about a vision for the nation, this side has it in spadesâ€”a vision for the nation which is backed up by the kinds of investments that we see made or secured through appropriation bills such as this and the appropriation bills and initiatives that have preceded it. In the context of the matters I was noting before about the growth area of Melbourne, and certainly the growth area in my electorate, I note today that there is some reporting on a recently commissioned report delivered today called One Melbourne or two? I look forward to the opportunity to consider that in some depth in the coming days. I understand that it is particularly focused on increased investment in Melbourne in those areas that are rapidly growing, including areas such as mine. I certainly know that growth continues to be speedy in the areas of Cardinia and Casey in my electorate, as it does in a number of other parts of Melbourne. I thought it was worth speaking about that in the context of some of the investments that this government has made to support the growth corridors in Melbourne in order to support the growing population of Melbourne and the growing population of Victoria. It is worth bearing in mind that the investments that were made in Victoria under the Howard federal government at its time of departing office were around $89 per Victorian. At this time it has more than doubled: it has gone to just over $200 per Victorian today. All told, this government has provided an unprecedented $6.8 billion from our six-year Nation Building Program to rebuild and renew Victoria's road, rail and public transport infrastructure. These are incredibly important investments and it is this government, and certainly not the Baillieu government, which is making those kinds of forward-thinking investments, recognising some of the growth pressures in Melbourne and, I am sure, in a number of other cities around Australia. I thought it would be worth reflecting later in my remarks today on some of the specific investments that have gone ahead in electorates such as mine in terms of education infrastructure, health infrastructure, roads infrastructure and social and community amenities. I think that is appropriate to do. These are issues that I have raised in this place which I continue to raise formally and informally in advocating on behalf of communities right across my electorate but in particular, in the context of this discussion about growth, in Casey and Cardinia. I look forward to the opportunity to speak further with those councils about some of the findings that are presented in this report. I would say, however, that in Victoria we have come to realise that any investments that are likely to be made in infrastructure and in growing communities come from this federal government. It is incredibly difficult, and many people will tell you that it is incredibly difficult, to get access to or find an opportunity to articulate the needs of growing communities to the Victorian Premier and to get any kind of meaningful response. We hear that regularly in the state. The overall investment in health and education by this government has been extraordinary, and certainly in Victoria that has been the case. I would like to talk about some of those investments in health and education in my electorate and also some of the other investments in relation to social infrastructure, roads infrastructure and other commitments that we have made to support our growing population. I note, as I have noted previously, that this government has made around $110 million in commitments and has delivered those commitments through the Building the Education Revolution program. But that is certainly not the only program that has gone to supporting capital works in my electorate. I am delighted to be able to say that we have invested heavily in trade training within my electorate, which is very much to the benefit of one of the growth regions of Melbourne. I can report to the House that Hillcrest Christian College has been the beneficiary of a trade training centre funding grant of $1.5 million to develop an equine trade training centre. That part of my electorate that is covered by Clyde and right across to Pakenham is an area that will certainly stand to benefit from this. There is a significant amount of interest in the equine industry. There are significant opportunities in the equine industry for young people and people who will be beneficiaries of education through this trade training centre. It shows the practical ways that this government is supporting prospects for employment and opportunity within the region. Likewise we have made a commitment of almost $1.3 million in a trade training centre at Belgrave. This is a trade training centre which will provide opportunities for training in hospitality, among other things, to not only students at Belgrave Heights Christian College but also students throughout the Hills region of my electorate. So those are two significant investments. There have also been quite significant investments in capital expenditure in a number of other schools throughout my electorate such as Beaconhills College and Heritage College, amongst others. I could certainly go on with quite a comprehensive list. But, turning to some of the other investments, I should note that prior to coming to office I was certainly an advocate for investment in a new facility for Outlook disability services, which operates in Pakenham for the benefit of residents and families in looking after people with disabilities, their carers and their providers of support. At the time I came to office it was clear to me that the facility they were operating in was absolutely rundown and in need of repair. It was really substandard. It was for that reason that I advocated for a funding commitment to be given to them so that in a growth area there could be a decent facility for people to go to seek assistance from Outlook, which provides disability services and which also operates some employment services within the region. It was for that reason that this government invested $3.2 million in the building of that new community centreâ€”to support the work of Outlook. It is something that I was very proud to support. Likewise there have been a series of other investments made by this government. This is all about our practical vision for the nation, articulated in electorates like mine and electorates right around the country. We have seen the commitment, for instance, through the regional and local community infrastructure grant with lighting at a recreation reserve in my electorateâ€”Holm Park Recreation Reserveâ€”some work at Pioneers Park and some work at Coonara Community House in Upper Ferntree Gully, which does fantastic work providing training to local residents and really being a place for the community to come together not only to seek training but also child care and a number of social initiatives. These are practical ways that we are supporting existing communities and growing communities. It is appropriate in the context of this kind of appropriations debate that those things be revealed because so often we hear from the opposition, with their sort of two-speed response to everything we sayâ€”they are a two-speed opposition; all that they do is dead slow and stop; there is no initiativeâ€”that they anticipate we will never make appropriations for appropriate health, education or social investments. All the funds for new initiatives, like the NBN and significant road development, come from the infrastructure fairy. This is an opposition which carps repeatedly, but which does not reflect on the positive thingsâ€”the significant investments in electorates such as mine, which are supported by appropriation bills such as these. We have seen a very significant commitment from this government in child care, particularly in my electorate at the Upwey Early Learning Centre, where we have invested a very significant amount in developing a new childcare facility thereâ€”over $7 million. In addition, we have provided funding for primary health care infrastructure. We have provided around three-quarters of a million dollars in primary care infrastructure grants, which to date have supported three GP practices in my area. This has expanded the services that they can provideâ€”additional rooms and additional infrastructure to support their existing patients and also to extend themselves into new parts of the community. That has certainly been received very favourably within my electorate. There are an extraordinary number of investments that have been made by this government to my electorate. I am sure that those councils I referred to earlier that have commissioned the report, which is discussed in the media today and entitled One Melbourne or two?, are very much aware of the investments that this government has made in relation to local councils. Certainly, they have been the beneficiaries of Roads to Recovery funding repeatedly. For instance, Cardinia Shire Council received about $1.2 million in 2011 under that program. Casey council received about $1 million; the Yarra Ranges Shire Council, also in my electorate, received almost $2 million; and Knox City Council received about half a million dollars. Those figures are certainly replicated subsequently. There has also been significant funding for the discrete Black Spot Program in my electorate. For instance, in Berwick at the intersection of Inglis and Buchanan roads and on Amber Crescent in Narre Warren. All of these investments are practical ways that this government is assisting people in growth regions and is assisting people right around the country. While those opposite would deny that these kinds of investments need to be made, and whereas those opposite will say that this is simply about spending for no good end and that it is seemingly wasted money, I suspect that the electors in my patch, as with electors right around the country in electorates which have benefited from Black Spot funding, Roads to Recovery funding, health investments, education investments and infrastructure investmentsâ€”big and smallâ€”would be very reluctant to take the same view, very reluctant indeed. These are practical investments which alter the lives of people right around the country, and particularly in growth areas. I am very pleased to be able to speak in favour of this appropriation bill, as I have been proud to speak in favour of the funding measures that this government has supported in the past."
"May I congratulate the member for La Trobe for recognising the great value of the Roads to Recovery program and the Black Spot Program, instigated by the Howard government. I wish her luck as she contests the next election against Jason Wood, the Liberal candidate, who was actually the member for La Trobe when these programs were introduced! I say to the voters of La Trobe that if they like their Black Spot and Road to Recovery programs they should go to the authentic thing, and that would be Jason Wood. It would be interesting to see how this budget would be explained in the context of the budget delivered in May of last year. These appropriation bills seek to adjust the services or activities area of the Commonwealth and also the capital work space. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2012-2013 is presented as a way of redistributing or providing additional expenditure requirements that have arisen since the May budget. There is a range in there that relate to changes in the forecasting of programs, program uptakes and new insights, the timing of payments and the like, and they cover a range of activities including support for the childcare system and the General Employment Entitlement and Redundancy Scheme, or GEERS, system, another measure introduced by the Howard government for employees who had lost their entitlements where their employer became insolvent. There is an allocation of funding for the royal commissionâ€”and I hope that goes wellâ€”and the synchronisation that is needed with the state based inquiries that are underway. There is also quite an extraordinary further provision of funding to deal with offshore asylum seeking, and it reminds us of the multiple billions that have had to be spent in border protection as a result of the abandonment of the effective and successful Howard government policies. I remind people in this place that when the Howard government left office there were four people in immigration detentionâ€”not 400, not 4,000, but four. Now we look at the thousands in our care as a consequence of Labor's failed border protection policies. There is some interesting work, particularly in further funding for the tax office targeted compliance activities. This must be of enormous concern for the small-business communityâ€”$390 million was announced in MYEFO as a further injection of funding for the tax office to essentially crack down on small business. Small business is doing it hard enough now, and is always inclined to do the right thing in terms of its responsibilities. To see almost $400 million of additional funding to give small business an ever harder time at a time when the economy and government policy are making things very tough anyway must be of concern, particularly on the back of the Inspector-General's report. That report found that targeted template metrics are used to have a look at BAS returns to identify variations and then trigger some audit and enforcement activity. It saw about 5,791 small businesses targeted through that templating strategy to be issued amended assessments, which the Inspector-General found to be false and unjustified, only to have to pay those amended assessments because they did not have the resources and the capacity to compete with the tax office. Now, on the back of that warning bell from the Inspector-General of Taxation there is another $390 million. Isn't it ironic that in MYEFO the only mention of positive small-business programs was what was being undertaken by the Chinese government to stimulate their economyâ€”that was somehow going to allay concerns about a fall-off in Chinese growth, and that was good for the budget. That was the way MYEFO presented it. But in terms of small business there is $390 million for a further crackdown. There is an allocation in here for that. In the capital work space, which is Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2012-2013, there has been some manoeuvring of funds within portfolios away from programs, and changes, particularly in Defence, in operations areas for new projects. There is also $45 million for ANSTO for detailed engineering designs as an equity injection into a nuclear medicine manufacturing facility. That will certainly be of interest. There is a further $32 million in capital funding to expand the immigration detention networkâ€”and I will not repeat my earlier comments. This is interesting, because we have had MYEFO identifying an enormous deviation from a budget delivered only a couple of months earlier, and here we are doing further shuffling of funding at a time when there is already concern and uncertainty about the reliability of the government's forecasting, particularly when you look at things like the mining tax. When you take away the administrative costs and lost company tax revenue that tax really does not make much of a contribution at all to the revenue of the Commonwealth. We learnt today of a substantial warehousing of more than $1Â½ billion in credits that can be laid off by major companies against future mining tax liabilities. This is the so-called super profits tax, which is really better characterised as a super disaster in tax formulation that has caused uncertainty and a chill in mining investment and optimism in Australia for very little in terms of additional tax revenue. What is not explained in these papers, though, is that on the back of record budget deficits, debt blowouts, wasteful spending, cost-of-living pressures and other debacles like those I have mentioned, is how the government is going to fund $120 billion of unfunded spending promises that were revealed by the Australian Financial Review. The government is keen on announcements, we understand that, and they are masters of political spin; but in doing the actual hard work of bringing forward a credible and sober plan to fund and implement these announcements and to then see that what is promised is actually followed through, their record is quite dismal. The Australian public is recognising that as an all-too-familiar characteristic of a divided and dysfunctional government. The government has walked away from the non-negotiable budget surplus promise. That promise was made hundreds of times, even in writing; and some of the leading government ministers wrote to their constituents telling them it had been delivered, which was extraordinary. The irony is breathtaking. I know that for one the member for Deakin wrote to small businesses in his electorate proclaiming the delivery of a company tax cut which never appeared and, despite what the government would say, has never surfaced for a vote in the parliament. They withdrew that of their own volition and seek to blame others for it. It is interesting that that same letter from the member for Deakin heralded the appointment of the first small business minister, which was, again, wildly inaccurateâ€”but there has been no correction or apology to the electorate or electors of Deakin for that error. We are still seeing the ramifications of these budget variations washing through the Australian economy. Today, particularly, there was more evidence from the New South Wales Business Chamber about the extraordinarily negative effect the carbon tax is having on small business. It is not difficult to work out. In my own electorate, where about 11 per cent of all jobs are in the manufacturing sector, those small businesses and medium-sized enterprises need to be world-class every day because we know manufacturing is under pressure and we see offshore options rearing their head, at times, at a cheaper priceâ€”they undercut our local suppliers because they are free of burdens like the carbon tax. The carbon tax continues to act as a reverse tariff on a big part of our economy. For all those operating within it, it continues to erode confidence, optimism and consumer spending ambitionsâ€”prospects for the future that are really hurting small businesses that do not have deep balance sheets or the capacity to ride out a carbon tax that is set to rise and therefore further exacerbate its negative influence on the economy, on consumer and business confidence, and on the outlook for future opportunities and prospects. Contrast that, in the small business area, with a clear, comprehensive plan to restore small business reward, hope and opportunity. It is actually the centrepiece of our plan Real Solutions for all Australians and I am happy to join my colleagues as I travel around the country explaining and working through that plan at small business forums. People understand that we have practical actions and commitments that will benefit the environment in which they operate and their prospects for the future, and they contrast that with the Gillard government's assurances of more of the same. I am reminded of the census index survey where only six per cent of small businesses thought that deal of government policies are helpful to themâ€”six per cent. Perhaps that might even be kind, but that is the number. Clearly a message that should be going out widely to the Labor strategists in the Gillard government is that the small business community is awake up to them. The fourth minister in 14 months is unlikely to improve their prospects. The neglect of small business in the G20 business advisory group; no mention of small business in the Prime Minister's Press Club speechâ€”these are example after example of disinterest and a lack of commitment to small business. My community knows that small business is not only the engine room of the national economy, they are the providers of prosperity in communities like mine in the outer metropolitan area of Melbourne. That is why we are so focused on seeing the business back in small businesses and we will implement, if we get the opportunity, a plan that recognises and respects their work and the risks they takeâ€”something that this government continually fails to do. The budget reinforces a number of concerns particularly of the 70,000 people who have private health insurance in my electorate. Various changes will mean the electors of Dunkley with private health insurance are likely to pay around $200 a year more for their private health insurance as a result of premium increases announced by the Minister for Health and other changes to the rebateâ€”the incentive, the modest encouragement that has been available for people who choose from their own discretionary income to provide for their own health needs. Even that incentive is being eroded by this government, and that is of great concern to the nearly 70,000 people who have private health insurance in my electorate. The vast majority of families are on very modest incomes, and they go without so they can have their private health insuranceâ€”yet the government tries to portray health insurance as some kind of a plaything for the rich and famous. That is absolutely not the case. In the private health space, not only is the private health sector important to the health care of the citizens I represent; it is also an important part of the economy. We have a number of private hospitals in my electorate that do outstanding work and community based hospitals like The Bays; I think of Beleura, I think of Peninsula Private Hospital, I think of the Frankston Private Hospital, to name those that are most prominent. At this time I am urging the state government to give clarity to the planning laws surrounding the proposed extension of the Peninsula Private Hospital. The site they are looking at has been identified as an anomaly to the urban growth boundary; there are planning processes in place for that but there is also a local planning scheme amendment that will shortly go to appeal. That process for the Peninsula Private Hospital's to expand its facilities in our electorate will be greatly assisted by clarity in the state planning policy. That is something that I will be encouraging. It is an interesting picture. These are variations to a budget that has already had a very limited shelf life. It is a budget that caps four of the nation's biggest deficits in history, that have seen accumulated debts and deficits of $172 billion. We see borrowings continue to expand. We have a government that inherited a budget surplus, no net debt and $70 billion dollars in net assets. It has just turned that around as if throwing money around is the solution to every problem; it has not been discerning and disciplined in making sure that outlays are soberly assessed and carefully implemented so as to get full value for money for the taxpayer. It is not just the taxpayers of todayâ€”let us remember that debt is a burden that lands on the taxpayers of tomorrow in the form of higher taxes as the debt will be serviced for years to come. Around $7 billion now would be an extraordinary contribution to programs like the NDISâ€”an opportunity we do not have because we are busily servicing this escalating debt that has been the hallmark of this Labor administration. I am optimistic that the Australian public will respond to the very clear plan that has been outlined by the Abbott coalition opposition. We are seeking to put forward clear strategies to strengthen the economy and build prosperity, so we have a safe and secure nation and so that individuals are not concerned about their own personal security. Mr Deputy Speaker, you must know about the anxiety people feel, about the uncertainty in the economy being added to by an ill-disciplined and dysfunctional government. That is not what the country needs now. Even the idea of adjusting the deeming rates has been captured with some cynicism by retirees wondering where the government has been for a number of years when there have been variations in the cash rate and the rates of return that people could get on their investments. It has not been adjusted for a long time. We need clear air for this country and a clear plan. Yesterday the Prime Minister's own department said the Prime Minister is focused on day-to-day issues. Nothing could be clearer than that. Where is the plan for the nation's future? That is where the energy should be, not just tactics on day-to-day political issues. (Time expired)"

"I might just take the opportunity to put the member for Throsby straight. It is true that the coalition opposed the steel industry package but, of course, it came accompanied by the carbon tax package at $23 a tonne, rising to $29 a tonne over the next four years when the rest of the world is paying about $6 tonne, and the steel industry is paying the carbon tax. The steel industry assistance fund roughly compensated for that amountâ€”in fact, a little more than compensatedâ€”but it will run out in four years, when the tax will continue to rise. Of course, it would not have needed that assistance had it not been for the advent of the carbon tax. But I will come to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2012-2013 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2012-2013, which are formulated on the basis of the figures that were put into MYEFO back in October, now admitted by the Treasurer to be pretty much useless because it seems they cannot give the Australian people any indication at all as to what the deficit will be in just four months time when the end of the financial year will arrive. In fact, the MYEFO was virtually out of date before it was printed. In particular within the MYEFO are the estimations on the mining tax, which at that stage was supposed to raise $2 billion, which was down from the $3.2 billion in the budget, which was down from the $4 billion when the PM and Treasurer Swan signed the agreement with the three big miners, which was down from the $10Â½ billion which they originally thought it would raise over two years, which is down from the $12 billion that the original RSPT was supposed to raise. In addition to that, within the MYEFO papers was a forecast of a budget surplus of $1 billion which the Treasurer has now admitted is not going to be met. So while the opposition will not bar the process of appropriation bills, it is worth noting that the figures on which they are formulated are highly suspect. I will come back to the mining tax, which is raising a lot of interest in the public at the moment, and quite rightly. Over the last six months it has raised $126 million dollars, less expenses. There is a $50 million cost to run this scheme and a foregone $38 million from income tax. That raises about $38 million net. I do not want to cause an argument with the good member for Casey, because he said in the chamber a couple of days ago that that amounted to $5.50 a head. Of course, he was talking about the gross amount, because the $38 million is about $2 a head. Now it seems quite likely the Obeid family has made more out of the resources boom than the mining tax, a lot more. It would be laughable if it were not so serious. It is worth remembering how the Prime Minister came to power and how important this was in her surge to take the prime ministership. She said the Rudd government was a good government but it had lost its way, and she nominated three causes which she saw as needing immediate attention from the Prime Minister. One was to abandon the ETS and not have a carbon tax. Within months we saw a complete reversal of that policy. The second was to fix the flood of boat arrivals, but boat arrivals are going very well indeed!â€”a complete failure of government and also a significant part of the reason that there is no surplus. The third thing was to settle the mining tax. The mining tax was a political fix, a deal to get the mining industry to stop their very public campaign against the government leading up to the last election. Like Neville Chamberlain, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, declared peace in our time. Her frontbench applauded, the caucus applauded, the electorate generally were pretty pleased, and the three big miners certainly applauded because they wrote the deal. In fact, BHP's Gerard Bond sent a draft of the tax to the Treasurer's office. The miners helped draft the tax, so no wonder they got a good deal. The most essential flaw at the heart of the mining tax is the obligation of the Commonwealth to fund state royalties, and what an incentive that was for the states to lift royalties. Every time they lift royalties, the Commonwealth taxpayers foot the bill. How could the triumvirate of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the resources minister ever agree to this? It was a guarantee to ensure that the tax would fail. But perhaps the greatest sin of the mining tax was to spend all the money before it arrivedâ€”before they even knew how big it wasâ€”$14 billion over the forward estimates, cash for everyone. In fact, Santa had arrived in the form of company tax cuts, increases to superannuation, cash payments for low-income people, instant write-offs, regional infrastructure funds, school kid bonuses. Some of these things in themselves are not too bad, but they are all just blatant bribes. And now, except for the $38 million net raised by the tax, it is all borrowed money, adding to the net debt of $160 billion and the $50 billion off-budget spend on the NBN and the as yet undefined and not budgeted for Gonski and NDIS commitments. It is money borrowed that will take at least 10 years to repay, with interest bills in excess of $7 billionâ€”hang onto your hat if interest rates go up again. So that is the mining tax. I will move on and draw your attention this morning to a pretty sad state of misadministration within my electorate. It involves Port Augusta, a vibrant city at the north of the Spencer Gulf. Port Augusta is one of the great crossroads of Australia, and a place where the traffic for the main east-west and north-south corridors of rail and road intersect. It is the service centre for the north of South Australia and southern Northern Territory. It is also a significant deliverer of services to the Aboriginal community of the far north. There has been a long-term effort in Port Augusta to combat alcohol and drug abuse, particularly in the Indigenous community. The city attracts large numbers of visitors from the remote Aboriginal communities, particularly in the summer when they come south to get away from the heat and to visit family. Some gravitate to Davenport, some into the town camp, some are just generally throughout the community. They cause enormous difficulties in themselves, but if these people happen to be alcohol dependent they cause a lot more difficulty again. The Port Augusta Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre was announced in 2007 and received support from the South Australian government in July 2008. It was to be funded from a commitment from COAG of $7 million to specifically address substance misuse in remote communities in South Australia. It was anticipated that the centre would start operations last year. Nothing has happened with that centre, I must say. Nothing at all. Questions were asked last year in the October estimates on my behalf. I was informed that the tender process, while delayed, was in the final stages of negotiation. I have recently been informed the tender process has now been abandoned completely and the government is no longer committed to building a facility in Port Augusta. This is extremely disappointing for me and for the Port Augusta community. While the Port Augusta community and the Port Augusta alcohol management team fully recognise there are desperate needs in other north-western communities, like Ceduna and Coober Pedy in particular, there is no doubt that if you are talking about a most central point to deliver the service to the most people, Port Augusta is essential. It is almost impossible to bypass. The Port Augusta council received advice in April 2008 that Port Augusta had been suggested as the location and considered eligible for this funding because of the high number of people from remote communities visiting or accessing services in Port Augusta. Tenders for the project to build and operate the facility in Port Augusta were called for in 2010. It took until 2012 until the council was informed that the tenders were not being proceeded with and the new tender proposition would not require the centre to be contracted in Port Augusta. In answer, again, to questions asked in estimates in October last year, we were informed that the delay for the Port Augusta rehabilitation centre facility had been due to the lack of access to a suitable site or service provider. The Port Augusta council informs me that it has suggested up to five different sites and offered to negotiate access and has had very little feedback or interest from the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health. They strongly refute that the department and the consultants used for the project, ARAP, have been working with the council to resolve the issues, as claimed in answers to questions at Senate estimates asked last year on my behalf. I have checked the available records and, to the best of my knowledge, just one meeting with the interested parties has been held in Port Augusta throughout the whole processâ€”in more than four years. The news that there is no longer a commitment to build the centre in Port Augusta is a kick in the guts for the very hardworking Port Augusta Alcohol Management Group. It absolutely seems amazing that the pledgeâ€”or what is left of it after the consultation feesâ€”will now be allowed to fund two centres: one in the north-west as was planned and the other one in the south-east. The original grant was to combat drug and alcohol abuse in remote areas. I do not want to throw any mud on my southern cousins, but how on earth could anyone describe the south-east of South Australia as remote? Somebody should get an atlas out and have a lookâ€”92 per cent of the state is within the boundaries of my electorate, and I can guarantee that every remote Indigenous community within South Australia is within the electorate of Grey. There are no remote communities in the south-east. The people in Port Augusta who have been working so hardâ€”actually not working so hard for this project, because they have hardly been consulted, but hoping so much that this project was going to be delivered, are absolutely livid at the idea that half of this money, and we are waiting for answers from the government, or half of whatever is left will be spent in the south-east. Going to broader issues just in closing, the Roxby decision has been a major setback for the region. Jobs continue to goâ€”another 100 last week announced by BHP Billiton. We all hope for the best and that that project will get back on trackâ€”with the possible exception of the Greens, who may not hope for that. I think there is a feeling within the electorate that South Australia is probably blessed with similar resources to Queensland and Western Australia and yet seems to find it so hard to get projects on track and happening. The optimists in the industry are now talking about the resources that will be freed up because of lack of progress at Roxby Downs and saying, 'This'll make our projects easier to deliver,' but we are not seeing evidence of that on the ground. Just to name a few, there are the IronClad and Iron Road iron ore projects on the Eyre Peninsula, and OZ Minerals at Carrapateena; Arafura are looking at building a rare-earth processing facility in Whyalla; there was Lincenergy's announcement of the discovery of $20 trillion worth of shale oil near Coober Pedy; there is a group working on the Braemar iron ore deposits nearer to the New South Wales border; and there are the Beach Energy and Rex Mineral copper prospects on Yorke Peninsulaâ€”and these are just a very small slice of the possibilities and plans for the electorate of Grey. There are major infrastructure projects needed to deliver many of these projects, and I am going to run through a quick list in the time left available. I am very pleased that RDA Eyre Peninsula in Whyalla has listed, as a high priority, the redevelopment of the Thevenard port in the far west. There is a need to deliver new ports on the Eyre Peninsula and Spencer Gulf. Perhaps Port Spencer will be the one that will go ahead in conjunction with Centrex Metals. A duplication of the gas pipeline to the upper Spencer Gulf, probably terminating in Whyalla, is going to be needed before too many of these projects can go ahead. We need a new interconnector to Eyre Peninsula. There are vast wind and wave energy reserves, and, bearing in mind the current debate on wind farms, there are very few people for the wind farms to offend. We still have black spots all over the electorate for mobile phones. The roads have a $250 million backlogâ€”and I am talking about the state roads here. There is $150 million a year, or thereabouts, raised in royalties in South Australia, which is just a very pale imitation of what is raised in Western Australia and Queensland. Very little of that is returning to the electorate of Grey, which is where it comes from. It is worth remembering not so much that the people of Grey feel they are entitled to that money, but if the rest of South Australia, if the rest of Australia, wants all of those vast resources in the Grey electorate to be developed, then the money needs to be spent there to enable those projects to go ahead."

"It is easy to laugh, yes. This is another great policy which I am sure that the member on the other side is quite proud of. Last year, we had a record number of boat arrivals. There were 274 boat arrivals, with 17,270 people. And we know the costs. The cost of these blow-outs to the taxpayer is $6.6 billion. That is $6.6 billion of taxpayers' funds that have been wasted on illegal boat arrivals. That is money that would otherwise have gone to our schools, our hospitals, our roadsâ€”all desperately needed. And what has the government actually forecast in the forward estimates? This is where it becomes amazing. Already this year 900 people have arrived illegally. That is the fastest start, the greatest number of arrivals, for any year on record. So it looks like this year will be worse than last year. But let us look at how the government has budgeted for this in the forward estimates. Amazingly, the government has actually budgeted for significant reductions in boat arrivals. In fact, the government is actually budgeting to have savings of $5 billion in reduced asylum seeker costs over the forward estimates, yet there is no change in policy. There is no change in policy and already this year we are seeing the numbers increasing ahead of last year and yet this government forecasts that it can save $5 billion over the forward estimates through reducing costs. Why does all this matter? It matters because it does not give us the ability to do things that we need to do. In my electorate of Hughes there is a road, Heathcote Road, which is a 24 kilometre section. On that road, in the last five years we have seen 10 fatalities and many more serious injuries. So I am sure the people in my electorate were very excited when they read the press release from the foreign minister, who provided $15 million to rehabilitate 40 kilometres of roadâ€”not in Western Sydney or in southern Sydney or in other parts of Australia but on the island of Kiribati. The reason given was that the road had been undermined by rising sea levels and coastal erosion. How do I explain to people who live in my electorate, where we have a road that is 24 kilometres on which there have been 10 fatalities, that this government has no money for this road but was able to find $15 million to fix a road in Kiribatiâ€”supposedly because of coastal erosion and rising sea levels. But if we actually look at the tide gauges in Kiribati, we see that there have been no rising sea levels at all. But yet that is the excuse given for using $15 million of taxpayers' funds. But, as I said, why does all this matter? We heard the member for Kingston talking about delivering for the people. But when this mob came to government they had $40 billion in the bank and a budget surplus, and they have blown the lotâ€”every cent. But that is just the start. On top of that, so far to date, they have borrowed $200 billion to fund nothing other than reckless, wasteful and politically motivated spending. And the majority of that has been borrowed from overseas, from foreigners. Let us just go through how we are going to have to pay this back. Let's just say we pay it back over 20 years. Including the interest repayments, it is going to cost Australian taxpayers the equivalent of $267 million a week every week for the next 20 years. I will put this in some perspective. Remember the great outcry over the sale of Cubbie Station, the privately owned property. Cubbie Station was sold to the Chinese for $247 million. I want all those who were concerned about the sale of Cubbie Station to think about this. Because of this government's reckless and wasteful spending, every week of the year for the next 20 years we are going to have to give away the equivalent of one Cubbie Station to pay off the debt that this mob have run up in just five years. There will be children who are not yet born who will be paying off Labor's debt. That is $14 billion a year. Just imagine what we could have done otherwise in the next 20 years with $14 billion a year. Australia simply cannot afford another three years of this Labor government."

"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). Financial management underpins everything that the federal government does. One of the frustrations as a member of this place is quite often the debateâ€”the media and public attention get drawn into sideshows and other peripheral ideals and images when the role of the federal government is to provide an economic framework for other things to follow. We need to look after our defences, we need to take control of who can come and live in this country or visit this country and we need to look after those who struggle to care for themselves. Unfortunately we seem to have been sidetracked. The financial situation of Australia is a disgrace; it is horrifying. When I speak to some of my friends and colleagues who were in this place at the end of the Keating-Hawke era, they remember the difficulty in repaying $96 billion in debt and the difficult decisions that were made. That figure is much, much higher now and it is going to be incredibly difficult to get the budget back in the black, and yet there is no clear pattern of infrastructure or other major reforms that we can show for that money. There are two forms of debt. There is debt that is a useful tool. Before I came to this place I was a farmer and debt was one of the tools that I used. But it is one thing using debt to fund infrastructure or something of importance like defence spending and it is another thing to use it to fund the frivolous and mismanagement. Over the last five years the mismanagement of this place has been spoken about. The effect on an electorate like mine has been devastating. Much was said about the BER program. Every school in my electorate has a lovely sign out the front saying that this is brought to you by the federal government, but when this program becomes an issue the federal government runs a mile. I asked the minister in here about a very tragic circumstance for some of the contractors in my electorate, and he washed his hands of it. I will talk about Chris Catterall, a builder in Moree. He has been a builder all his life. He has a small business and he signed up to work on the BER program. He was assured that it was federal funding and everything would be fine but, due to the collapse of Reed Constructions, Chris is now $642,000 out of pocket and is given no comfort or indication of when he may be able to receive that funding. For a small operator like Chris, $642,000 is a lot of money, and I am sure he will not mind my saying that, at the age he is, it is going to affect his ability to retire when and how he was planning to. Going back a few years earlier, Jarrod Kennedy, who is a metalworker in Dubbo, found out that due to the collapse of TCT Constructions he was not going to be paid for one of the jobs that he had done, a COLA in the Marra Creek school in western New South Wales. What did Jarrod do? He is an innovative young chap. He went out on a Sunday with a gang of men and a crane and he demolished the COLA and brought it home. It caused him a little grief for a while, but he felt that he had built it and was entitled to be paid for it. Those sorts of things are happening all the time. The pink batts scheme: I have got a contractor in Dubbo who is out of pocket tens of thousands of dollars because of the difficulty in the paperwork and administering it. It may be things like because it is a rural property it does not have a street number, and so it is not accepted by the data methods that are used or there is doubling up on street numbers. There are administrative things like that and I believe the word has been put out to make it very difficult for these people to get their money. It is over budget and they have spent billions of dollars putting pink batts in and nearly as much money taking them out but there is collateral damage on the ground to small businesspeople who are having a go and thought they were safe because their were working for the government. Take one of the larger decisions that was made, the carbon tax. In the last government, 2007-2010, I was asked once: 'What was my greatest achievement?' I said it would be part of the push that defeated the emissions trading scheme. Unfortunately, due to the change of mind of the Prime Minister at the last election, we ended up with the carbon tax. The week the carbon tax came in, the Kandos cement plant closed downâ€”over 100 jobs; over 100 years of history producing cement in the Mudgee area. Because of the carbon tax, that plant is now uneconomical. The great irony of this is that Mudgee has now become an area for wind farms, so on one side of Mudgee you have got the hills for the wind farms and, on the other side, you have got the coalmine. Because of policies that we have at the moment, the coal from Mudgee goes over to China, gets turned into wind farms, comes back and the cement that secures these wind towers to the hills, instead of being produced locally, comes through Sydney Heads on a ship from Asia and is trucked back to the midwest. Other changes that this government has brought are the changes to the isolated child allowance. It is a great tragedy today that country kids have got 30 per cent less chance of gaining a tertiary education than their city counterparts. Due to protests and much of the lobbying done by this side of House, the government reinstated the allowance in a fashion but the means test means that many, many country people who live in urban areas are excluded. We have got people with two or three kids in towns like Dubbo, Mudgee, Inverell, Moree, Burke, Cobar and Warialda who are in the unenviable position of deciding which of their children should have a tertiary education and which of them should not. In the year 2013, I think every child in Australia should be entitled to proceed to the level of their ability and not be restricted because their parents cannot afford to send them to live away from home. Regional development is another issue. I will acknowledge that in the last term of government I have had three projects in my electorate through the Regional Development Program. The towns that received this moneyâ€”and I will acknowledge that Moree, Dubbo and Mudgee were pleased to get their projects upâ€”were the only towns and the only councils that, due to the design of the program, were large enough to have the resources to actually put in an application. The application that Dubbo City Council put in for their regional athletics track cost, I think, in excess of $50,000. Smaller communities cannot spend that sort of money simply to put in a proposal. This goes to the fact that the minister's understanding of how regional areas work is clearly lacking. There are a whole heap of smaller communities that have had worthwhile projectsâ€”not million-dollar projects but ones where a couple of hundred thousand dollars would mean a lot to that community's ability to progress and move on. Up until this point, they have largely missed out. There is another round of the Regional Development Program coming out and we are hoping that some of these smaller communities might get a start there. In relation to telecommunications, there has been much discussion in this place about the NBN; but what has not been discussed is the fact that there are still parts of Australia that have no mobile phone coverage, and so it does not matter that people talk about fast broadband speeds when you are excluded. With mobile phones now being the primary source of communication, to live in an area where you do not have mobile coverage is absolutely unthinkable. I will talk about the village of Goolma, which is on a busy crossroad, between three major towns: its entire valley is without mobile coverage. We have the issue now where emergency service messages are being delivered by mobile phone. People in such areas cannot get the call-out. I spoke to a rural fire service volunteer at Wellington who lives in an area with no mobile phone coverage. He did not get the call-out to a fire because he has no coverage. This government raided the $2.7 billion that had been put aside for the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund; it is now gone. This is the pattern that we have been followingâ€”money that had been squirrelled away by the previous coalition government to fund ongoing infrastructure into the future has been raided. A lot of these failed programs have now become a future tax burden for our children and grandchildren. I do not think that they are going to be very impressed paying taxes in years to come for the insulation that went into their granddad's house that nearly burnt it down. This is the great tragedy of what is happening now. The NBN is still years away from getting to my communitiesâ€”if it ever does get there. The great irony is that Telstra saw Conroy coming from miles away. Most of my constituents gain their data through the Next G networkâ€”through 3G or 4Gâ€”which is not part of the NBN and never will be. We have here a proposal for the construction of a white elephant. The other misconception is that there is some sort of broadband desert out there. Most of my schools have fibre-optic cables connected to them. My hospitals have fibre-optic cables connected to them. I spoke to the principal of a large accounting firm in Dubbo on Saturday night who told me that they have very fast broadband. A lot of that is already there. The idea that the government somehow are the champions of broadband, and that nothing had happened before, is an absolute nonsense. If there is a change of government on 14 September, I look forward to getting some common sense and rationality into the broadband debate. The people of regional Australia know that they deserve to have fast broadband and mobile coverage, and we need to make sure that that happens. Infrastructure, particularly in my part of the world, has not been a high priority for this government. We have spoken previously about the inland rail. If you want practical ways to reduce emissions in this country, taking the trucks off the Newell Highway and putting them on a train is a logical way of doing that. This has been spoken of for some time. The inland rail needs to happen. In the last heavy rainfall event that came down the east coast of Australia, we saw how Queensland became isolated freight-wise because of the reliance on transport up the east coast. An alternative, fast, efficient and cheap method of moving produce between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane in an inland manner, and ultimately connecting through to Perth and Darwin through the inland port of Parkes, is something that is long overdue. A lot could happen this year. But if on 14 September the Australian people do decide to go in a different directionâ€”and I am certainly hoping that they doâ€”it is going to be an enormous challenge for the coalition to clean up the mess that has been left and push Australia back in the right direction. (Time expired)"
"I rise to speak on the appropriation bills and to follow the excellent contribution from the member for Forde in relation to the spending of the Australian government. I have spoken in relation to appropriations over the past five years that I have been in this place, and once again we see the government seeking funds to conduct the ordinary business of governmentâ€”but in the context of a budgetary condition that you could only describe as absolute free fall. Let us have a look at what is happening right now in the nation's budgetary situationâ€”with perhaps the worst example of public policy in our era being the mining resource rent tax debacle. This has a profound impact on the economy's bottom line and the budget's bottom line and is another reason that the government will need to appropriate money at a rate that I think is completely unsustainable. I have spoken on many occasions on how already in the Australian budget every single dollar that is collected in individual income tax is sent out the door in the form of welfareâ€”a completely unsustainable budget footing. What you have with a mining resource rent tax that does not bring in any revenue is, of course, a bad taxâ€”something that discourages investment and hinders the ability of companies to plan securely for their future. But what is worse is to find a government of the calibre of this Labor government that spends up to $15 billion against money that is not going to ever come in. That is completely unsustainable expenditure. That is completely unsustainable expenditure. It is not the first time we have seen it from this government. Each day in question time we see a series of questions put to this government. What is it going to do to fix this situation? Why has it put $15 billion expenditure against no incoming revenue? How is this going to be funded? Of course, the Treasurer today was completely embarrassing when he really had no answer about how it was to be funded. Of course, he does not know how it is going to be fundedâ€”he has not thought about it. The only answer, of course, is borrowing, more borrowingâ€”more debt and more deficit. Borrowing against the future of this country, borrowing against the future employment of this country, borrowing against the future generations who will have pay for the flagrant expenditure of this out-of-control Labor government. We have seen the whiz-kids of the Labor Party come up with the slogans about the surplus. Not only did we see Penny Wong and the Treasurer on 650 occasions go out and say that we were going to get a surplus. We saw the wonder kids of the Labor Party put out on Twitter a little logo that said, 'Back to the surplus in 2012-13'â€”playing off the movie Back to the Future, thinking they were being clever. I know the member for Bruce is having a little chuckle. It is funnyâ€”'Back to the surplus 2012-13.' Those crazy Labor kids! What are they going to do next? The only problem is that the same people are running this country's government. I know I have found some sympathy in the member for Bruce about the state of the current government. 'Back to the surplus'â€”these crazy Labor kids running the government seem to think this is some kind of joke. It is not funny. On 650 occasions you have the finance minister and the Treasurer announcing a surplus. You have the Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury announcing to his electors that he had already delivered a budget surplusâ€”that is, all those families and businesses and honest hard-working people in Western Sydney have been told by their local member, who serves in this place as Assistant Treasurer, that he has delivered a budget surplus. He has delivered it! But he has refused to retract, to correct, to respond to his votersâ€”to tell his electorate the truth, to update them that 'Back to the surplus' was just a movie concept. It was never going to get made; it was a low-budget film that was never going to get into production because the actors were too D-grade. On a serious note, he refuses to go out and front his electorate and tell them that his much vaunted budget surplus is never going to be delivered under this government. Are we to believe that this is due to commodity prices? My answer is that I do not think so. We know for a fact that federal government revenue is now $70 billion higher than it was when the government took office. We know that just from MYEFO. Commodity price revenue is forecast to rise by $37 billion and the write-down was in the order of $3 billion to $4 billion. The write-down in commodity prices was just a small percentage of the total increase in government revenue, and yet this government says, 'Because we have lost a couple of billion on the commodity market, the entire budget is going to fall into chaos.' That is what we are supposed to believe from this government. What are the Australian public, investors, businesses, people from overseas to make of a government that seriously links its political fortunes and its ability to deliver a surplus to commodity prices? Commodity prices are volatile. Commodity prices will rise and fall. For the first time in this country's history we have the unedifying spectacle of a Treasurer who has gone to the media on a week-by-week basis essentially to say each week: 'Well, this week the surplus is not going to happen. I'm sorry, commodities are down.' Then the next week there is a bounce in the commodity prices and he starts to say, 'Well, look, maybe we'll get there.' This is an unsustainable approach to government. This is an unsustainable approach to managing the budget. No wonder we are in an economic climate where people are hanging onto their money. People are hanging onto their money because they know the kind of people who are running this Labor government. They know the kind of people who are running this country. You cannot trust them. If you are a large mining company, you cannot trust the word of this government. We know what would happen if this government were re-elected in September. We know what they will do. Their word means nothing. Their signature means nothing. They will go to any length to cover up their own grave inadequacies and failings. The MRRT represents perhaps the single biggest public policy blunder in Australian history. It is a completely unedifying spectacle and it has serious consequences for ordinary people who lack confidence in the economic climate and the ability of the government to manage the economy. In the context of this appropriations bill, I think it is important that we continue to talk about what Labor is doing to the budget and some of the expenditure, because expenditure is the problem. I mentioned that we have had $70 billion of increased revenue since Labor came to office; however, the problem is that we have had $90 billion worth of expenditure increases since Labor came to office. Expenditure has now reached proportions that mean that our deficit is becoming larger and larger. Of course, the government is right to say that comparatively, in an international context, our deficit is low; that is because of the conditions they inherited from the previous Howard government. What we see now is this completely out-of-the-ether set of conceptsâ€”whether it be Gonski, whether it be the dental scheme, whether it be the National Disability Insurance Scheme or whether it be the NBNâ€”and projects of a size and scale which makes them completely unaffordable. These projects, which are completely unsustainable in a budgetary context, are simply being announced to try to salvage the government's political fortunes. It is a daily exercise in this parliament. It is a daily exercise in the public arena. How can we afford to fund $6 billion for Gonski, billions of dollars for dental work, $4 billion to $5 billion for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and $40 billion for a National Broadband Network? Who is going to earn that money? Where are those funds going to come from? And who is going to pay for all that debt you will have to go into to try to fund these schemes? Some of these ideas are worthy. Some of these ideas have merit. But you cannot fix the world's problems without having the how. You have to know how you are going to fix it. You have to know how you are going to fund it. If you do not have a plan to do that then you really have no idea how you are going to solve the problems that challenge us for the future. It is crazy to think that even with one of the most socialist governments of our time, it cannot even redistribute wealth properly. This is a government that cannot even take from the rich and give to the poor. They have buggered up the mining tax. It is a pretty simple job. The member for Bruce would know this. Socialists throughout history have been able to take from the rich and give to the poor. This is a government that cannot even do that. It is completely failing in all regards. I want to turn to my electorate and some of the real plans and solutions that the coalition has. What I have been very pleased to see is the Leader of the Opposition bringing forward our plans for the next election. I am happy to lend the member for Bruce a copy of this booklet here, which is Our planâ€”real solutions for all Australians. It contains 21 points. He will find it good reading. An honourable member: I'm sure it is a very quick read. It is quick. It is not of the length of a speech by an Independent about forming government; it is really a concise summary of the plans that we intend to take to the election."
"interjectingâ€”"
"No, Member for Hume, this is not confidential stuffâ€”I am happy to gift a copy to the member for Bruce right now for his benefit. I think the most important part of this document, Our planâ€”real solutions for all Australians, is helping small business create stronger jobs growth. The economic plan that the coalition has is based around the understanding that small business is the fundamental driver of economic wealth in this country. It is not that business is the enemy, not that every time you change the industrial relations law or other forms of law that you ignore the impact on small businessâ€”the real drivers of economic growth and employment in this countryâ€”like the government does. It is about understanding that at the heart of government decisions we must ensure that the changes we make are friendly to small business. The five pillars that the coalition is talking about are very important: ensuring that we have a good mining sector; ensuring that growth is at the heart of the economy; stopping small businesses paying an extra 10 per cent for their electricity by removing the carbon tax; removing the wasteful and investment-discouraging tax of the minerals resource rent tax; and getting on with cutting red tape and reducing costs by $1 billion a year. It is an important plan, which focuses on manufacturing innovation, agricultural exports, advanced services, world-class education and research, and boosting our mining exports to make the most of our advantages in the international marketplace. It is a realistic plan and I think Australians can have some fundamental confidence in knowing what their government is going to be doing. That is the real criticism of this government and the people that run it: nobody in any sector of this economy knows what is going on with the federal government. Nobody can tell. It does not matter what sector you go to, everybody says the same thing: we cannot get an answer from the minister; we cannot get an understanding from that department about what is going on, about what is next, about what this legislation will do, what it means, where it will head. Nobody knows because the government do not know where they are heading with all of these programs. But perhaps, as I have spoken about many times in this place, the most distressing thing about the budget and the appropriations and where this government is headed is of course defence expenditure. I have mentioned in this place before that the primary function of a federal governmentâ€”in fact, one of the reasons for being of the federal government and the prime motivatorâ€”is having a Defence Force for Australia. The Labor Party's website says that the first priority of government must be the defence of the nation. The first priority! That is why it is shocking to this House to understand that the Defence portfolio has had its spending cut by 10.5 per cent in one yearâ€”the largest annual reduction since the end of the Korean War in 1953. When I saw the Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, standing at the dispatch box today, I thought, 'How does he stand at that dispatch box every day as the cabinet minister who took the biggest annual expenditure cut in his portfolioâ€”such a significant cabinet portfolio?' There are people in this chamber who have been in cabinet who are no longer in cabinet. How can you front up to parliament each day as the cabinet minister that lost 10.5 per cent out of your portfolio in such a critical and vital area? It is distressing I think for most Australians to understand that we are now ranked 65th in the world in defence spending. Considering we regard ourselves as one of the most advanced nations, with a role to play in our region, with a role to play in the free world, how can we sustain that mission for our ADF and our defence personnel if we are ranked 65th in the world in defence spending and we are sustaining 10.5 per cent cuts in the annual defence budget each year? That is the real consequence of economic mismanagement. The fundamental priorities of government suffer. The defence of our nation, which is at the very core of what this place is supposed to be about, is taking a substantial financial penalty. Not only that, but all of the ordinary families, businesses and hardworking people out there are suffering as a consequence of the fundamental economic mismanagement of the government. It is time for a new government in Australia. It is time for a government that understands the economy and what drives growth and prosperity in an economy. It is time for this government to pack it in."
"I rise this afternoon on very important health issue for the nation and particularly for my own electorate of Maranoa. The topic is rather sensitive but I am taking this issue very seriously. I would like the government to take note of what I am saying, particularly in relation to this appropriation bill, to make sure that money could be appropriated to increase community and nationwide awareness of the issue that is growing across Australiaâ€”sexually transmissible infections, STIs. The Queensland Health department state: Sexual health is not just for people who have had sex or have a Sexually Transmissible Infection (STI). It means taking care of your body, your health, and your partner's health and making decisions about having sex. Trying to avoid STIs is part of sexual health. That is a direct lift from the Queensland Health department pamphlet promoting sexual health. Previously there have been successful campaigns, even now, against smoking. Some of the images are graphic and I believe that has had an effect and is having an effect. We all know the effect that smoking can have on human health. It is important that we send a message, graphic as that is, in relation to smoking, across the nation. There have been ones about diabetes and how to avoid the possibility of diabetes because of its consequences on your health. We have had them on obesity as well. I believe these campaigns in relation to the health and wellbeing of our nation are important. I well remember the Grim Reaper campaign when the AIDS epidemic took off. It was graphic in its portrayal of what could happen but it sent a very, very strong message across the nation. Australia-wide, there is now an alarming increase in sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-AIDS. In my electorate of Maranoa there is a new transient demographic that presents its own unique set of sexual health issues for my constituency. Education and awareness is the key, because the statistics are alarming. With HIV-AIDS, prevention is the only cure we have. The statistics for Queensland show increases for cases from 2007 in relation to gonorrhoeaâ€”some 1,328 cases were reported in 2007 and in the latest statistics available, for 2011, some 2,878 cases were reported, a doubling from 2007 to 2011. Chlamydia: 12,696 cases in 2007 and in 2011, 18,320 cases. Syphilis: some 200 cases in 2008 and in 2011, 340â€”almost a 60 per cent increase in reported cases. HIV: one diagnosis in 2008, five in 2009 and eight in 2010â€”so those reported cases are also rising, perhaps as small numbers but the trend is there. In 2011, chlamydia was the most frequently reported notifiable condition in Australia with some 79,833 new notifications for persons aged 15 years and over, or 435 cases per 100,000 of our population. This is nearly seven times the rate of the most frequently reported notifiable STI, gonorrhoea. This rate has more than tripled over the past decade, increasing from 130 notifications per 100,000 in 2001. The past decade has seen rates of sexually transmittable infectionsâ€”STIsâ€”increase across Australia. STIs are predominantly contracted through unsafe sexual practice and can show no symptoms. If untreated, STIs can have serious long-term consequences for a person's health. Do we need to bring back, perhaps as part of this program, the Grim Reaper-style health awareness programs that were put out during the AIDS epidemic, given the rapid progressive increase in reportable STIs? However, this year is 2013 and we are not in the 1980s. We know that HIV-AIDS and STI diseases are not limited to any particular demographic in our society. My electorate has a new demographic emerging. A report tabled today by the member for New England on fly-in fly-out workers highlights some of the changes in demographics that are happening in my electorate and many of those rural and regional communities where resources are being developed and exploited. Being active is the 'common cold' of sexual health. People are taking more risks with their sexual health by dabbling in unprotected sex. The Daily Mercury reported: Australian Medical Association (AMA) Queensland president Dr Richard Kidd said it was not just the young, single miners spreading diseases. I am not suggesting it is the miners spreading it, but they are his words, not mine. The article continued: 'We're aware of anecdotal reports concerning pregnant women presenting with STIs, being treated, and getting a STI again before pregnancy concludes,' Dr Kidd said. 'So presumably their partners are infecting them again.' Dr Kidd said the mix of a large disposable income and boredom meant fly-in, fly-out mine workers were responsible for the increase in cases of STIs in townsâ€” like those in my electorate in particular. I think the committee report on fly-in fly-out practices that was tabled today by the member for New England touches on the social change that is occurring in many of our communities where these resources are located. While FIFO is not much of a holidayâ€”I can assure you of that because I talk to many of these peopleâ€”it can induce a disconnection from normal restraint and behavioural patterns, and we are seeing the results: we have seen a doubling of gonorrhoea over four to five years; we have seen an increase in syphilis by two-thirds in that same time, a 66 per cent increase; and an increase in chlamydia by one-third since 2007. The other issue that is exacerbating the situation is the lack of doctors and nurses in mining towns. I was speaking with the Mayor of the Western Downs Regional Council only last Friday in my electorate and I asked: 'How many fly-in fly-out workers have we got in camps in the Western Downs Regional Council area?' They are trying to get an idea of that because of the impact it has on the traditional population of many of our towns. They do not know but they are trying to go to the mining companies and ask them just how many people are in the 40-odd camps that are located in the Western Downs. Their estimate is that they have got something like 24,000 workers in camps in the Western Downs region. I know, in my home town of Roma, there are camps of 3,000 or 4,000 people. I estimate that, in the Maranoa Regional Council area, there is something like 20,000 workersâ€”most of them fly-in fly-out. It is difficult for those communities when all of a sudden a population increase hits their town. It also has an impact on the ability of the local doctors and nurses who are dealing and coping with the existing population prior to fly-in fly-out workers. Because of the resources and the construction of these resource camps and the resource development, it has an impact on the ability of health services that are there to cope with this massive influx. If I can use the figures that I was given towards the end of last year, in a town north of Romaâ€”Injune, in factâ€”in 2008 there was something like 80 to 130 presentations per month at the local hospital, where there are a nurse and a doctor present. In January 2012, there were 1,000 presentations at that hospital. Compare that to 80 to 130 only three years earlierâ€”the average since that time is about 600 to 700 a month. These are people who have legitimate health issues, who want to see a doctor or a nurse for whatever reason, but it has almost been impossible for the staff to cope. I commend the staff there for the work they are doing, but it highlights not only the significant change in demographics but also the challenge that is out there for all of us. I know that a number of mining companies have contributed to new facilities for communities but I am not aware of any support for increased health services where they are really needed. What goes on behind closed doors is the individual's business, but let me take you on a tour of the local newspapers in my electorate. It is open for everyone to see. FIFO sex workers in Maranoa is the title: 'Misty' is a FIFO prostitute, one of hundreds to descend on Queensland's roaring mining towns in Surat and Galilee basins in the Maranoa. She has a lot in common with her clients: she lives on the east coast but she's flexible about where she'll work. I am astounded because the story the local paper ran stated what she could earn in a week. This is something quite new, I can assure you, to some of the towns and the local papers in my electorate, a very conservative area. But they ran the story. She remained anonymous in the sense that there was no photograph of her, but she said she was earning 'as much as $10,000 a week'. That is 10 times the average weekly wage. It goes on: A sex worker can put their mobile phone number in an ad on the internet or in the local paper and they're free to go where the work is. The only problem is finding a hotel roomâ€” or a motel roomâ€” in a town with such a transient population. It is an issue. Whilst I know prostitution is a regulated industry, the lure of lucrative mining communities means that illegal prostitution activities are increasing and people are taking chances with their sexual health. Education and awareness is the key, because these figures that I have put on the Hansard this afternoon are quite alarming. People should not be ashamed of visiting their local doctor. They should be prepared to go and have a check-up. Health professionals respect your privacy. They do not discuss your private business with anyone in the community. Also, the earlier you find an STI, the easier it is to treat and the less damage is done to your body. So don't be ashamed to talk about your sexual health and ask for a test if you think you might have an STI. Put your mind at ease. What I am saying is that, with the changing demographics in many of these fly-in fly-out transient populations and the illegal prostitution that I know is out there, given some of the advertisements in the local papers and the reports that are flowing back, the risk of STIs is rising. The numbers that are now starting to be reported in relation to STIs are alarming. I call on the government, particularly in response or part-response to the report tabled in the House today on FIFO workers, to run awareness ads that target this issue of STIs and your sexual health. It is in the nation's interest."
"I heard on the radio recently some comments about the Australian wind power industry. Much like the man who voiced them, they were sharp, tough, honest and uncompromising but fair. Dr Alan Watts is an exceptional Australian, a gentleman I am proud to know as a friend. Dr Alan Watts HDA, BSc, MB, ChB, LRCP, MRCS, a recipient of the prestigious Order of Australia for his services to medicine, has leapt to his feet in disgust to voice the silent experience of rural Australians who are shackled by the devastating impact of industrial wind development. Alan reminded those of us who had been sucked in by the clean, green, wind turbine daydream that we are paying through the nose for the high price of our ignorance and inner-city elitist ideologyâ€”and, worse, that we will continue to pay until such time as the dirty business which is the clean, green daydream of renewable energy ideals is replaced with sensible and achievable objectives. Said Alan: Industrial wind is a fraud of enormous consequence whose foundation is based on greed, ignorance, subsidy and entrenched institutional deceit. People who value intellectual honesty should not allow themselves to be quietly fleeced by such industrial treachery or even by their government's callous â€¦ indifference. He also said: Wind industry propaganda flatters the gullible, exploits the well-intentioned â€¦ And he said: They plunder our environment while enriching foreigners all under the guise of some mythical societal benefit. They take our health, our land, our peace of mind and our taxes. Why? Why do we continue to goose-step to the whoosh, whoosh, thump whim of industrial turbine power stations and the blind eye of the Gillard government? What is at stake and who is paying for it? The news ain't good, ladies and gentlemen. We are through our bills, our super funds and the green bastardisation of our national and cultural identity. This is government-sponsored fraud. All Australians, metropolitan and rural, are being sucker-punched by an industry ideology. The wind industry has squirrel-gripped this nation. Industry, in revolt of reason, would otherwise be trembling in their snake oil stained carbon footprints. In 2007 several purse-pioneering union fat cats all resigned within a few short weeks from their directorships at Australian Super, the Australian super fund of the year. Where are they now? Greg Combet, former union boss and Julia Gillard's minister for climate change, tells us these turbines are necessary to mitigate the disastrous effects of global warming. So perhaps it was not a great look buying a beachfront property while all those polar bears are drowning. Dr Watts and everyday Australians still believe in the little thing called democracy. The democracy we live in is charged to repel corruption through the protection of our legislation, not the lax interpretation. Last night I talked about the government sponsored fraud wind turbines. Where did this rural nightmare begin? Wind turbines were marketed by Enron, an energy trading company that was based in Houston, Texas. Enron was one of the most fraudulent corporations in the history of the United States. Enron Wind Systems was formed after the acquisition in January 1997 of Zond Corporation of California, the largest US developer of wind-powered electricity at the time. Enron went bankrupt in 2002 along with the dissolution of Arthur Andersen, one of the oldest accounting firms in the US. On 10 May 2002, following the Enron scandal, General Electric acquired the assets of Enron Wind Systems, continuing as GE Wind Energy. GEâ€”imagination at work. You will note that the phrase 'imagination at work' does not invite a lawsuit for false advertising. The Gillard government's Clean Energy Future advertising package, however, is open to a case of false advertising, fraudulent misrepresentation and gross negligence. If you study the involvement of fraudulent companies in the wind industry, you begin to realise that this corporate misbehaviour has full government support. As with the Enron scandal, the wind industry would not be operating in Australia without its close financial relationship with our government agencies. It does not stop at the federal level. There are also significant conflicts of interest within the New South Wales government. When politicians in government office embrace the idea that wind funds are intrinsically good in all situations as they are combating climate change, their decision-making becomes criminal through ignorance. They repeat the fraudulent misrepresentation that they have been lobbied with by the wind industry, such as wind turbines reduce GHG emissions; wind turbines generate renewable energy; this wind farm will generate enough electricity to power X number of homes with the actual figure being usually one-third of the quoted number. Fraudulent misrepresentation is when an individual fails to use reasonable care by giving advice negligently, as they are under a duty to use reasonable care to see that representation is correct and that the advice, information or opinion is reliable. Eraring Energy is a state-owned corporation that manages a diverse set of electricity generating assets located throughout New South Wales. Eraring Energy has combined generating capacity of over 3,200 megawatts, including Eraring power station at 2,880 megawatts. Eraring Energy was established as a state-owned corporation on 2 August 2000 under the State Owned Corporations Act 1989, the Energy Services Corporation Act 1995 and this Energy Services Corporation (Eraring Energy) Regulations 2000. Eraring Energy owns the Blayney and Crookwell wind farms. The Crookwell Wind Farm is in my electorate in New South Wales. The Eraring Energy 'Gentrader' contract and renewables trading, together with corporate support, Treasury and information technology functions, are managed from the Sydney corporate office. Renewable energy certificates are giving tremendous returns to the companies involved. The industry-union superannuation funds will soon have more money to invest in wind farms, with the Gillard government increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent by 2020. The REC is a political unit that an electrical retailer will purchase to comply with the law of the land. If the retailer does not have enough RECsâ€”a percentage of electricity must be from a registered 'renewable' sourceâ€”then it is fined by the federal government $65 per megawatt hour to make up the quota it has not purchased. That percentage is around five to eight at the moment and will be at 20 by 2020. Australia currently has an oversupply of renewable energy certificates from the solar industry because of the government incentives. This has kept the REC price down, under $40, but look at what happens when these are worked through the system. To get to the $90 for a REC, it has been calculated that the $65 penalty is equivalent to $90, claimed as a business expense. Basically, one is a fine; one is a tax-deductible expense. The renewable energy certificates scam runs out in 2030. The wind industry applies for a REC for each megawatt they produce and feed into the grid. The REC 'ticket' is then sold to a retailer of electricity if they need to meet the federal government's legislation. All of this scam is not transparent; in fact, I believe it is intentionally deceptive. How is all of this relevant to my constituency? Let me walk you through what benefits my constituency would receive if there were a serious attempt to refocus on and change the direction of this get-rich-quick pot of gold for renewable energy opportunists. I will talk about the scale of subsidy in my electorate. In Hume alone, the subsidy for new wind turbines, excluding existing turbines, is set to reach $500 million to $1,000 million per year, or up to $10 billion over 10 years. This subsidy is equal to around $450,000 to $900,000 for each new turbine. Meanwhile, communities are at war with each other, adjacent landholders face serious land value losses and health issues continue to emerge. If the wind industry subsidy for Hume were given to the electorate to spend, we commit we could do the following. We could reduce emissions by 50 per cent more than is achieved through the wind turbines. We could solve every major infrastructure problem inside the Hume electorate. To name a few things we could do in infrastructure, we could: duplicate the Barton Highway, $600 million; rebuild the Goulburn hospital, $150 million; set up CCTV cameras in every major town to prevent crime, $2 million; fix mobile phone and TV reception black spotsâ€”for example, in Crookwell, $2 million; and pay off the Yass council debt of $18 million for heightening the dam wall. After three years of using the subsidy to fix infrastructure problems, we could hand back all of the subsidy to the government to reduce electricity pricesâ€”up to $7 billion over seven years. We are prepared to give these numbers to the Parliamentary Budget Office or Treasury for verification because we know they are right. Who benefits from the subsidies? In the end, the costs of the subsidies are worn by electricity consumers. Meanwhile, the beneficiaries are the wind companies. They receive this subsidy in the form of renewable energy certificates issued by the federal government when the power is generated and redeemed at market price. Despite the massive subsidies involved, investors are losing faith in these companies. Their share prices have dropped where they do not have other large businesses outside of wind. Raising money for wind projects is now extremely hard, with the only realistic options being to search for Chinese or other state sponsored capital, to fund the developments from profit or to look for more union sponsored money. Does wind make sense as a source of power generation? One of the questions we need to answer is whether wind turbines are the most economic way to reduce carbon emissions. We can clearly say two things on this: first, the excessive cost of wind turbines makes them uneconomic unless they receive large subsidies relative to other means of reducing emissions; second, we should allow the most economic means of reducing carbon emissions to succeed without favouring one option over another. I will spend more time on both of these points. Massive subsidies are required to support wind. The raw economics of wind demonstrate what a poor option it is. The cost of producing coal fired power is about $40 per megawatt hour. The cost of producing gas fired power is closer to $60 per megawatt hour, with half the CO2 emissions of coal. The cost of producing electricity from wind is around $100 to $120 per megawatt hour. Low utilisation and high capital costs are the main reasons for this. On top of this, wind requires backup power for times of low generation and this further weakens its economic case. Some argue that the costs of wind generation are coming down. However, the costs of other renewables, particularly solar, are expected to come down much faster. Wind energy is bringing down its costs by increasing the size of the turbines, and this is creating more community unease. If it is true that costs are coming down, let us use wind when it makes sense to do so, not before. Another way of thinking about the economics of wind is to compare wind with other options for reducing carbon emissions. Using wind to reduce one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions costs around $60 to $80. Other means of reducing emissions cost less than $30â€”indeed, this government believes it can substantially reduce costs at the current level of carbon tax to around $25. The cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions in Europe is below $10 per tonne. So, in order for wind investments to occur, large subsidies are required, and that is not just compared with other means of generating electricity but compared with other means of reducing emissions. Who pays for these subsidies? These subsidies are built into electricity prices. We all pay more in our bills to subsidise wind and other renewables. The quantity subsidised increases each year and will continue to do so until 2020 at least. By 2020, we estimate that this subsidy could be as large as $3 billion. This will require tripling or more the number of turbines and, in all likelihood, the construction will not happen fast enough to meet the targets. The scale of the subsidies is an important reason for why wind turbines are going out of fashion in countries across the world. In closing, all I have to say on this very complex subject is that all we need is a leader of strength to recognise that there is a very serious problem with the wind turbine industry in terms of offshore $2 companies ripping off, in a fraudulent way, taxpayers' resources as a way of funding their projects and taking the money offshore with them. The $52 billion that is currently in the system for this renewable energy exercise should be looked at, reconfigured and put into the reconstruction and restructuring of infrastructure in this great country of ours."
"I rise this evening to speak to appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4 of 2012-13, bills that seek to appropriate $1.7 billion for government departments and agencies. These are additional expenditure requirements which have arisen since the May budget was brought down. This Labor government, the highest spending government in Australian historyâ€”in fact they will spend over $90 billion more this year than the last budget of the Howard governmentâ€”is once again asking for more money. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2012-13 seeks to appropriate $600.8 million arising from changes in the estimates of program expenditure, variations in the timing of payments, increases in forecasted program takeup and policy decisions taken by the government since the last budget. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) seeks appropriations totalling $666.36 million and includes $32 million in capital funding to expand the immigration detention network. For the layman, this simply means they have wasted the money and want more. We on this side of the House, we the members of the fiscally responsible party of Australia, the coalition, left Labor with a $20 billion surplus and no net debt. Perhaps if we were watching an American sitcom or a satire on the governing of some Third World country, I would be smiling. I am not smiling and this is not a sitcom, although the past Labor years have certainly had the characters and the plots for a blockbuster Australian sitcom, the title of which may go along the lines of 'Dummy's Guide to Destroying the Country'. This government has created so much chaos in the political sphere that itâ€”the chaosâ€”has become the norm. Perhaps late at night in the corridors of this House, the Labor Party members listen to the Sex Pistols and live by the quotes of Sid Vicious: Undermine their pompous authority, reject their moral standards, make anarchy and disorder your trademarks. Cause as much chaos and disruption as possible but donâ€™t let them take you alive. Before anyone asks, I am not a fan of the Sex Pistols, I just like interesting quotations. Speaking of interesting quotations, on no fewer than 650 occasions did the Prime Minister, Wayne Swan the Treasurer and Penny Wong repeat their promise to deliver a surplus. Yes, 650 times the most senior of the Labor Party spruiked their budget surplus. Then, in the hope that Christmas festivities would detract from the announcement, Mr Swan, our Treasurerâ€”the same Mr Swan who collected the world's best treasurer awardâ€”declared there would be no surplus after all. Rather than admit fault and take the blame for the use of wasteful spending and poor fiscal management, our Treasurer chose to blame 'a huge revenue whackâ€¦out of the blue.' Out of the blue? What blue is Mr Swan talking of? Is it the dark blue cloud of despair all Australians have been living under since Labor started wasting taxpayers' money. That is the only blue I can think our Treasurer was referencing because no thinking personâ€”especially the world's best treasurerâ€”would have imagined or believed, even in their wildest dreams, that this Labor government would deliver a promise, let alone a surplus. This government has delivered the four biggest budget deficits in history, with a cumulative value of $172 billionâ€”meaning, in effect, that the government has spent $172 billion more than it has earned over this period. History tells us that this government did not have a revenue problem, it just has a revenue forecasting and spending problem. It has consistently assumed unrealistically high levels of future revenue, spent at those levels, and then cried, 'Woe is me,' when the politically inspired forecasts are not realised. The Prime Minister, in an election advertisement in 2010, stated: Most importantly, I'll ensure the budget is in surplus by 2013. In 2011, the same Prime Minister said in a speech: My commitment to a surplus in 2012-13 was a promise made and it will be honoured And then, in a speech I am sure she would rather forget, the Prime Minister in an address to the McKell Institute in July 2012 said: We saved jobs, stayed out of recession and got back to surplus. That was wishful thinking, I would say. This Labor government's own economic benchmark for the past three years has been a surplus in 2012-13. Now we are looking at world's best treasurer delivering his fifth consecutive deficit and Labor's 11th out of its last 11 budgetsâ€”surely a track record one would not be proud of. Every year in office this government has increased its borrowings. The face value of Commonwealth securities on issue has increased from around $60 billion under the last years of the coalition government to over a quarter of a trillion dollars today. Labor has sought to increase the limit on the government's debt ceiling on four separate occasions. In 2008, the limit was amended to $75 billion. This was increased in 2009 to $200 billion. In 2011, the government increased this limit yet again to $250 billion. Finally, in the last budget they increased this limit to a record of $300 million. I am not a mathematician or an economic guru but I, along with the majority of Australians, have common sense; and common sense tells me that if you consistently spend more than you have, you are going to go broke. That is what we on this side of the House have been telling everyone for years. Australia is going broke at a rate of knots under this Labor government. Today's debt is tomorrow's taxes, and we know this government is not shy about introducing new taxes. This Labor government has announced 27 new or increased taxes since coming to power. I imagine you could find a lost tribe buried under the maze of paperwork shuffled around as they rob Peter to pay Paul. As George Bernard Shaw once said: The government who robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul. I suggest that the people of Durack, the largest electorate in Australia, my electorate, are sick of this government robbing them to pay for not only their eastern seaboard mistakes but, in the case of live exports, their international mistakes. I say 'mistakes' kindlyâ€”perhaps it is more so a direct act of Greens-hugging treachery. The profound financial impact on graziers and associated businesses from the government's decision to ban live cattle exports to Indonesia on 7 June 2011 cannot be underestimated. In excess of 9,000 direct jobs are created by the live export trade throughout rural and regional Australia, and for every one direct job created in live export another 1.6 jobs are created in the wider community. Now we hear during Senate estimates that the aid package paid by the Australian government to Indonesia is to increase productivity in the Indonesian cattle industry. It actually exceeded the amount put into the northern Australian cattle industry as compensation for the shocking knee-jerk reaction in 2011 with the live export ban. This city-centric government has allocated $20 million to the Indonesian beef industry to improve its productivity but to date has allocated a mere $12.7 million to the Australian industry. It would appear our taxpayers' money is being used to boost another country's industry to the detriment of our own. It makes no sense to me or my constituentsâ€”in fact, little that this government does makes sense. Where is the sense in unravelling strong and secure border protection policiesâ€”policies that worked so well during the Howard years? Already 2013 has seen more people arrive by illegal boats than was seen at the start of any other year on record, with more than 900 people having arrived since 1 January. This follows a record calendar year of boat arrivals in 2012, with 17,270 people landing on our shores. Since 2008, when Labor unravelled the secure border protection policy, and up until the end of 2012, Australia has seen the arrival of 546 illegal boats. Based on the 2011-12 figures, every boat is on average costing the taxpayer $12.8 million; $6.5 billion of taxpayers money has been wasted on trying to fix a problem that did not exist. There is no sense in reinventing the wheel. There never has been and never will be. This government should admit it is wrong and that the Howard government was right and stop throwing good taxpayer money after bad. This government should be improving hospitals, increasing the educational opportunities for regional students and relieving Australian families of the cost of living burden rather than supporting economic opportunists who arrive on our shores and then knock on doors for more concessions. Speaking of knocking on doors: people in this country and Durack in particular, in the days before the bungled minerals resource rent tax was introduced, used to have investors knocking on their doors, wanting to invest in the low sovereign risk minerals and resources industries of Australia. Now investors are comparing us with Africa and often deciding that that destination is more secure. Miners are already paying more tax than any other company structure in Australia. They are paying around 46c in the dollar when most companies are paying 30c in the dollar. Miners are paying billions and billions of dollars in royalties to states. The mining tax, the bad tax, which resulted from a bad process, is complex, costly to administer, inefficient and does not raise any meaningful revenue. Yet the world's best Treasurerâ€”and, Deputy Speaker, I am quite sure you know that I use that descriptive term with tongue firmly in cheekâ€”yes, the Treasurer, Mr Swan, has spent all the money he stated the tax would raise, and more. The government wined and dined voters on money it did not have. Rather than the $2 billion the tax was expected to raise this half, it in fact gave a return of a paltry $126 million.â€”less than five per cent of the projected income. Considering the company tax forgone, plus the cost of administration, this is an economic blunder of monumental proportions. It appears to me that this Labor government, rather than encouraging and supporting entrepreneurial Australians and companies, disparages and taxes them. We on this side of the House take a different approach. We like to support those individuals and companies who do well, for who else will finance this government's passive welfare mentality, a mentality that has bred contempt rather than admiration for those who succeed? It seems that across the eastern seaboard the tall poppy syndrome is alive and well. How dare there be rich people in Australia? How dare there be companies who have had a go? It seems that an army of spin doctorsâ€”about 1,600 as at 13 August 2012, staff employed by federal departments and agencies in media, communications, marketing and public affairs rolesâ€”on which this government spends $150 million a year, are earning their keep. The following is often attributed to Abraham Lincoln, but some say the words are actually those of William Boetcker, a German born Presbyterian clergyman. Deputy Speaker, I will let you be the judge of the origin. I quote: You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot help small men by tearing down big men. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot lift the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer. You cannot help the poor man by destroying the rich. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than your income. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. You cannot establish security on borrowed money. You cannot build character and courage by taking away men's initiative and independence. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves. I add my own to these words of truth and wisdom: you cannot live in a debt-free Australia with Labor at the helm. The Prime Minister herself said, 'You can't run this country if you can't manage the budget.' I imagine that the history books, when written, will not favour this dark period in Australian politics, this dark period of debt, untruths and wastefulness. This government is a Clayton's government, living under Clayton's rules, full of Clayton's promises and Clayton's surpluses. It truly is the government you have when you do not have a government."
"'The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end there it is.' So said Winston Churchill. The Department of Defence has a problem with accepting the truth. Questioned in 2004 regarding the joint strike fighter, Air Marshal Houston stated, 'The expectation is they will begin arriving in Australia by 2012.' He went on to say, 'It is a conservative estimate. That is when we would expect.' In 2005 he said, 'We are still planning on 2012.' In 2007, he again stated delivery would be in 2012 and the initial operational capability, or IOC, would be in 2014-15. In 2009 Dr Gumley, head of the Defence Materiel Organisation, said, 'The JSF is on schedule. I think the test program is running four or five months late.' To reiterateâ€”'running on schedule'. We have been talking about 2012 and initial aircraft in 2014 with IOCâ€”well, initially 2013 IOCâ€”and he said, 'It is not something I lose much sleep about.' I do. And if I were Dr Gumley, he should have. Because ultimately these aircraft are not experiments in marketeering; rather they are tools young men and women in uniform will use to defend this great nation from enemies with superior technologies. It is a question about lives, not maintaining the extravagant livelihoods of Lockheed Martin executives. In 2011, Air Vice Marshal Osley told parliament that the US JSF program manager, Vice Admiral Venlet, said, 'The program is now founded on a great deal of realism.' Air Vice Marshal Osley said, 'I think our estimate is now becoming a realistic estimate instead of a conservative estimate.' Then the IOC was taken to be 2018, and he reiterated his confidence on this numerous times in testimony. But a few months ago we were told that this has now slipped to 2020, and Bill Sweetman of Aviation Week and Space Technology, the trade bible, states that IOC in the US is only likely to be in 2020. Even if this does not slip, how would you like to order a 1991 VN Commodore and finally take delivery when the competition is producing the FG, or current model, Falcons? How competitive would that VN Commodore be? Should you stick with your VN Commodore? The Department of Defence seems to think so. On Defence's risk management matrix, a slip of merely 12 months is considered an extreme level of risk, yet the program is now over half a decade late and there are no flags being thrown up. In 2005, Air Marshal Houston said, 'Currently the indicators are that the flyaway costs for the F-35 will be about $45 million.' In 2006, Air Commodore Harvey is talking about 'approximately $US47 million on 2002 base year'. We are getting them early, so Harvey said 'approximately $55 million average for our fleet'. Then in 2008, Dr Gumley stated that he would be surprised if we paid more than about $75 million a copy for the aircraft measured in 2008 dollars, 'assuming we buy at least 75, or three squadrons'. I was told by Defence in then Minister Nelson's office that the average unit procurement cost that was being worked on by Defence was $131 million per unit. So why did Dr Gumley say he would be surprised if we paid more than $75 million each? Defence deliberately talk costs that make up the price instead of the price, so that they can obfuscate. In 2010, then Air Vice Marshal Harvey, in talking about fleet, said it was $75 million in 2008 dollars at a 0.92 exchange rate. The Government Accountability Office in the United States, talking about average procurement cost of the JSF, said it has gone up from $69 million in October 2001. In April 2010 it was up to $114 million each. In June 2010, after a Nunn-McCurdy breach, it was revised to $133 million per copy. Using the risk management matrix at 10 per cent, increase in cost is severe and a combination of severe and almost certainly means that you will have a category of extreme level of risk. Once again, why no red flags? Air Power Australia are routinely denigrated by Defence which will obviously have a negative impact on the work they get as well as organisations such as REPSIM. The reason they are denigrated is that they have the audacity to criticise the JSF program. Problematically for Defence they tend to be accurate, whereas Defence woefully fails. Take cost, for example. In 2006-07, Air Power Australia had an estimate of between $136 million and $176 million, far more accurate than Defence talking about significantly less than $100 million. Were they just deliberately misleading parliament, given they had admitted the $131 million average unit procurement cost to me in 2007? They tend to hide behind many definitions of cost, deliberately obfuscating failed projects by throwing various prices and costs out there. Air Vice Marshal Osley also boasted of no foreign customers having pulled out and he even boasted of it 'not being beyond my level of expertise to comment on politics in Canada' before assuring us that it was just politics in Canada and Canada would stay in. In fact Canada has pulled out of the program. The Danes have ordered advanced F-16s as a stopgap which I am told will likely become the final capabilityâ€”in other words, they will dump the JSF as well. The Dutch are prevaricating and the probability is that they will pull out. As I have said, there has been unfair criticism of APA by Defence. As an example, Air Vice Marshal Osley stated of APA's criticisms of the F-35's aerodynamic performance that it was: â€¦ inconsistent with years of detailed analysis undertaken by Defence, the JSF Program Office, Lockheed Martin and the eight other partner nations. He further stated that their analysis was: â€¦ basically flawed through incorrect assumptions and the lack of knowledge of the classified F-35 performance information. The Joint Operational Requirements Document, or JORD, had specifications on various measures of performance. For acceleration at 30,000 feet the objective was 40 seconds or less and the threshold or bare minimum was 55 seconds. We were told by Defence that it would meet spec and Tom Burbage, head of the JSF program with Lockheed Martin, misled parliament in March last year by stating: 'The airplane will continue to be well in excess of its basic requirement. The aircraft is meeting all other requirements to date.' He stated 'other' because it failed to meet the range requirement of 590 nautical miles and they have conveniently changed the definition of the requirement for the A-model which Defence recommends we get so that it could reach spec. In terms of that acceleration spec, the JSF program office in the US has asked the Joint Requirements Oversight Committee, or JROC, to relax the requirement to 63 seconds which is similar to the performance of a 50-year-old F-4 Phantomâ€”so much for meetings spec. In 2006, APA calculated the A-model would take over 60 seconds for acceleration which has now proven correct. This is on record at the same time that Defence and LockMart were telling us it was meeting or exceeding spec. Whose analysis is flawed now? Similarly, for turn performance, the aircraft had an objective to sustain six g at 15,000 feet with a bare minimum threshold of 5.3 g. In 2006, APA calculated it could only sustain 4.7 g, at the same time that Defence and LockMart were assuring us that it would meet spec. Once again, JPO has requested JROC to relax the spec to 4.6 g. This is less than said 50-year-old F-4 Phantom, which was known as a truck for its turn performance at the time. Whose analysis is flawed now? So much for the years of detailed analysis undertaken by Defence, the JSF program office, Lockheed Martin and eight other partner nations. This aircraft has had very austere specifications placed on it in the JORD, and LockMart has designed the aircraft not to meet the objectivesâ€”which were not much of a stretch anywayâ€”but with the bare minimum threshold specs, and have failed to even meet them. They have a weight problem with the aircraft, and military aircraft always put on weight. This aircraft is only 270 pounds under the maximum allowable empty weight according to the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. They have even gone so far as to remove fuel stop valves and extinguishers in the dry bays, which, according to the DOT&E, increases the aircraft's vulnerability to ground fire by 25 per cent compared with legacy aircraft. But this program is based on magic! Because, in terms of the fundamentals of air combat, this aircraft is a comprehensive and hugely expensive failure. It is a $1 trillion program over its life, so no wonder we are getting so much spin and so little substance. By every measure, the aircraft is an outlier. We are told that this aircraft will let the missiles do the workâ€”no need for high aerodynamic performance; it will all occur at beyond visual range. So why do they crow about the 50 degree angle of attack capability which is only important in close combat? The reason is that, according to Defence and LockMart, the JSF is the answer, and therefore anything it can do is important and great but what it cannot do is irrelevant. They are quite willing to mislead, lie and obfuscateâ€”anything to ensure the continuation of this white elephant. Remember, even if it achieves the 2020 IOC, this turkey will be in service until 2060 or so. Do you really think it will be remotely competitive then? Why are the Russians, the Chinese, the Europeans and indeed LockMart with its other fighter, the F-22, spending so much money for these aircraft to have supermanoeuvrability and supercruiseâ€”or the ability to cruise supersonically without using afterburnerâ€”if it is not important? Indeed, the JSF will have to light up the sky to get into a position to fight using a lot of fuel-hungry and very hot afterburners which can be seen from a long distance away, just to get to the speed required to do that. Does the JSF program really have the ultimate and only correct view of air combat, a view that bets against the basics of air combat that have been shown to be fundamental to air combat time and again over the last century, despite people having bet against said fundamentals on numerous occasions? Are those who designed the J-20, J-31, F-22, Eurofighter, Gripen and Rafale all wrong? Are the fundamentals of air combat and the wisdom of the likes of John Boyd and von Clausewitz all wrong, and only the mighty Lockheed Martin Fort Worth division is correct? I want Tom Burbage, the head of the JSF program with Lockheed Martin, to come to parliament and explain why he did not give false and misleading information to this parliament. If we do not insist on full transparency, our fighting men and women will be the ones to pay the price, not those in Russell offices or the boardrooms of Lockheed Martin. Finally, no doubt Defence and LockMart will state that the magic is classified and hidden, and we will have to take them on trust that it truly is revolutionary, it will change the nature of air combat, and that is why it is a world-beater. The problem is, on all unclassified measures where we have had the opportunity to compare the facts with what they have assured us is correct, they have been shown to be wrong. Furthermore, when independent experts have been demonstrated to be correct on these measures where Defence and Lockheed Martin have failed so dismally, when they warn us that the JSF is uncompetitive, I believe we should take what they have to say extremely seriously and demand evidence from Defence and LockMart. We should demand that they show us, not simply assure us. In the final analysis, facts are stubborn things and I am more stubborn still."
"I rise this evening to talk about some serious health issues that have arisen in my electorate and the failure of this government to provide sufficient funding for programs to address them. As anyone who has experienced a serious illness knows, poor health can impact on many areas of your lifeâ€”some would even say that without your health you have nothing. Yet health in this area has suffered greatly under this government. Typically, though, the government does not want to take responsibility and instead is trying to shift the blame to the state government. In Queensland in particular, the federal Treasurer, Wayne Swan, only last month claimed the Queensland government was responsible for cuts to public hospital funding despite the cuts appearing in his own budget papers. The most recent figures in the Final Budget Outcome for 2011-12 and in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2012-13 clearly showed that the total federal funding for health will fall by $988 million this year. Yet the Queensland government knows that health is a priority and will increase the Queensland health budget by $816 million in this financial year. I would like to highlight a statement made to the Queensland parliament on 28 November 2012, in which Health Minister Springborg said: The key difference in Health under this government, compared to its predecessor, is that Health dollars matter â€¦ Health dollars buy operations. They buy beds. They pay staff. They are what enables us to improve the health of Queenslanders. The good management of Health dollars enables improved facilities and services. With good management, we extend our reach into remote area health. It enables better access to advanced medicine. It facilitates research and we reap the benefits. This clearly shows that the LNP is committed to ensuring that Queensland Health is able to provide vital front-line services in the face of challenges left to the department, including a bungled payroll system that has cost taxpayers billions of dollars and a waiting list of patients that has left nearly 200,000 Queenslanders stranded. Labor's budgetary mismanagement is so bad that, at the time of the change of government, the combined 2011-12 budgets for health districts and corporate head offices were $130 million in the red. While these challenges are immense, Queensland's ability to address these issues has been significantly eroded by the actions of the federal Labor government. Here again, I am quoting Minister Springborg: The Labor government is gone, but the legacy of Laborâ€™s financial mismanagement remains and the burden it imposes gets worse. Why? Because while the LNP strives to fix these serious problems we are sabotaged by a growing problem with Labor financial mismanagement in Canberra. He goes on to describe the unheralded midyear budget cuts imposed by the federal Treasurer, who has cut $382 million from the Queensland Health budget over four years. Because economic forecasts are so badly mismanaged by the Treasurer, two years of unforeseen and punitive cuts to Queensland Health will be felt in just seven months. In my electorate, that is $6.5 million from the Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service and $900,000 from each of the Cape York and Torres Strait-Northern Peninsula services. A total of $103 million will be deducted from Queensland Health by the Commonwealth between December 2012 and June 2013. This equates to some 1,000 jobs state wide, stripping the department of the capacity for 84,000 births, 15,000 hip replacements or 112,000 tonsillectomies. Why is it not a priority for the federal Treasurer? In my electorate of Leichhardt, these cuts have been felt in the key area of mental health, especially in the provision of mental health services for young people. The Time Out House in Cairns has been a major resource for young people aged between 15 and 25 with mental illnesses, providing critical residential and outreach support services. Over the past three years, it has provided short-term accommodation for 38 people, supported more than 100 young people in an outreach program and made a huge difference to the lives of young people and their families. Yet, with the federal Treasurer's cuts, Queensland Health could no longer afford to fund this service, and the house was due to be shut on 28 February. Staff members were in the process of moving clients to hospitals and homes, selling furniture and looking for new jobs. I became actively involved with this only last week. I was seriously concerned about the outcomes for two young people who are accommodated in that area. It had taken a couple of years for those families to find them an appropriate level of accommodation. At last, they were somewhere that was age-specific, and it was making a significant difference to the lives of those young people. I am pleased to announce today that, after some very significant lobbying by Ivan Frkovic, State Manager of Queensland Aftercare, the state government has agreed to continue to fund the centre for an extra six months. I congratulate Health Minister Springborg and his office for their efforts and their foresight, compassion and understanding of the seriousness of the situation. This funding extension will allow for the residential care to continue; but, unfortunately, not for the outreach support service. I was able to ring the family of one of the young people who was staying there. They had already removed their young person, and I asked them to take them back last Monday to give them a chance to stay there, which they readily did. It is certainly my intention to fight for a funding commitment for this centre in the upcoming federal election. Mental health has long been a priority for the coalitionâ€”and this program's success, I can assure you, cannot be ignored. Another area of concern that I have been raising consistently in this place is in relation to the spread of drug resistant tuberculosis. It is a major issue that Queensland Health has been forced to deal with on behalf of the federal government. Papua New Guinean nationals, particularly those from the Western Province area, who have tuberculosis have been coming across the border seeking support and treatment in Queensland. Many times, as I said, I have spoken in this House about this issue, so I think most people would be familiar with the fact that the islands of Saibai and Boigu, which are to the very north of my electorate in the Torres Strait, are located within only a few kilometres from the Papua New Guinean coastline. For a number of years, health clinics on Saibai and Boigu were treating people who had come across that narrow strait seeking better health services than what were available to them or, in some cases were almost non-existent, in their region. Other more seriously ill people made the journey to Cairns, such as 20-year-old Catherina Abraham. She will spend the next 2Â½ years in an isolation ward at the Cairns Base Hospital, where she is being treated for Extensively Drug Resistant Tuberculosis. The cost of that treatment to Queensland Health will be in excess of $1 million, provided that young lady survives the treatment. For the 2009-10 and 2010-11 financial years, Queensland Health estimates that the provision of health services to PNG nationals who travel through the Torres Strait Treaty Zone and present to Queensland Health facilities exceeded $32.7 million. After chasing reimbursement from the federal government numerous times, in June last year Queensland Health was forced to sign off on a project agreement to receive $8.1 million or forfeit the entire amount. To this day, Queensland Health has yet to receive the remaining $24.6 million. I ask the question: how can the state government be expected to properly fund programs when it is obviously being hamstrung by the federal government? When I hear that a 15-year-old girl in my electorate has had to live in an adult psychiatric unit in the Cairns Base Hospital because there is no mental health ward for adolescents and young people in North Queensland and that the closest facilities are in Townsville, Brisbane, it certainly disgusts me. The girl's mother has written to me several times, desperate for assistance and outcomes, saying that her daughter 'will continue indefinitely in this extremely inappropriate living environment while medication experiments and other treatment fumbles continue'. At the same time, she tells me that the Medicare rebate for occupational therapy has been slashed. Instead of 16 visits a year, in 2013 she will be able to access only six sessions, with an additional four if it is an acute situation. She wrote: I request that you apply your attention to this immediate issue as it will place my family, my child and many other critical and needy families and their young people in a very precarious situation. I certainly wish that Treasurer Swan would come up to my electorate and spend a few hours in the shoes of this family. These cuts are in addition to the nearly $4 billion that has been slashed from private health insurance and the $1 billion a year from dental health through the closure of the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme shut down on 30 November. That was a grave mistake, because in our regional area and in our Indigenous and remote communities there is an absolutely vital need for this service. The statistics are quite soberingâ€”51 per cent of our Indigenous children under the age of five have been hospitalised for dental treatment compared to 34 per cent of non-Indigenous children; Indigenous people between the age of 17 and 20 are 8.2 times more likely to have decayed teeth; and 49 per cent of Indigenous adults between the age of 35 and 54 avoid certain foods because of their oral health problems compared to 17 per cent of other Australiansâ€”so much for closing the gap. It does not matter what your background is as delays in getting better treatment given these conditions mean the particular condition worsens and at the end of the day this means major surgery. Figures for 2009 showed that in the Cairns and Hinterland health district dental conditions were second only to diabetes complications as the most common cause of potentially avoidable hospitalisations. With a rate of 353 hospitalisations per 100,000 people, the Cairns and Hinterland rate is significantly higher than the wider Queensland rate of 267 incidents per 100,000 people. Unfortunately, given that the new child dental scheme does not commence until 1 January 2014, this means that there would be a gap of some 13 months in seeing young people, and I fear for these children who may remain untreated as to what impact that will have on their overall health. In addition, Labor's proposal for adults does not commence until July 2014, which is 19 months after the Medicare scheme closes. Until then more than one million patients who would have been eligible for the chronic disease dental scheme will lose access to timely dental treatment. Despite these dire needs, this government chooses to cut the funding to this scheme. No doubt these cuts will be used to fund schoolkids bonuses and process asylum seekers or plug some other parts of this government's enormous budget black hole, which is growing every day. I can certainly tell you that where it will not be going, and that is towards the provision of health services to deal with the extremely serious alcohol and drug dependency issues in the remote Indigenous communities in Cape York. I watched the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap statement in parliament last week and was very disappointed with her comments. She talked about how winding back the alcohol management plans would result in rivers of grog and added that the interests of Indigenous children would come before the interests of the alcohol industry. In my electorate there are nine shires with alcohol management plans that are in place plus two communities where alcohol is restricted under the Cape York Welfare Reform trial. Surrounding townships have been negatively impacted by the influx of people with alcohol problems who have been forced to move to new areas because the Gillard government has refused to fund the appropriate medical and social infrastructure and services they need. If the Prime Minister really cared and if she were really serious about dealing with alcohol problems in remote communities, it would be reflected in her actions. That would start with an investment in medical detox centres in the regional health facilities along with the establishment of healing centres in adjoining community outstations. There is also a need for a significant increase in the placement of alcohol and drug counselling and mental health experts in these remote areas and these regional areas. This is the kind of action that would demonstrate a genuine commitment to this very complex problem. This would certainly contribute to the closing of the gap, not the political rhetoric that we are seeing at the moment. To close, I can only shake my head in sadness as I look at these four key areas of health that I have mentioned tonight and at the impact that the loss of services is having on the people in my electorate. The legacy of this government will be one of absolute waste of money through pink batts, school halls and immigration blow-outs. Its financial mismanagement is demonstrated by four consecutive record budget deficits and a $120 billion black hole of unfunded promises. We can do much, much better and I look forward to the opportunity of doing so after 14 September."
"It is my privilege to stand before this chamber today and speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), which seek to appropriate $1.27 billion from consolidated revenue for government departments and agencies. What the bills before the chamber today confirm is that you cannot take the government at its word. Back in 2007, when the member for Griffith was seeking to become Prime Minister, he said to the Australian people that he would be an 'economic conservative with a capital c'. He tried to put to rest the Australian public's concerns that they have with Labor governments: easy come, easy go, with no understanding of what it means to get deeper and deeper into debt, no understanding of what it means to have interest payments that cripple future generations, no understanding of what it means to see waste and mismanagement on a grand scale that has probably never been seen before in Australia. But that is what we have seen since Kevin Rudd became Prime Minister in 2007 and handed the baton reluctantly to the member for Lalor, who put the knife into his back to become Prime Minister of Australia. But that is what we have seen since Kevin Rudd became Prime Minister in 2007 and handed the baton reluctantly to the member for Lalor, who put the knife into his back to become Prime Minister of Australia. Do not look at what this government says; look at what this government does. Since 2010 they have promised the Australian people that they will bring this budget into surplusâ€”that has come from the Prime Minister's mouth alone on more than 165 occasions. 'Failure is not an option,' is what the Prime Minister said. The Treasurer said a surplus would be coming Australia's way on more than 360 occasions. He said it would come 'hell or high water'. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation said on more than 140 occasions that a surplus was 'non-negotiable'. This so-called rolled gold guarantee became a commitment, which then became an objective, then became a guiding principle, then was an expectation and now, we know, will never, ever be delivered. This is just not good enough. The Howard-Costello government bequeathed a golden legacy to the Labor Party and to all Australians in 2007: a $20 billion surplus, more than $70 billion in the bank, zero government debtâ€”let me say that again: zero government debtâ€”a more than 20 per cent increase in real wages, more than two million new jobs and the lowest unemployment and inflation in three decades. Not a bad record for a government of nearly 12 years. That is what we left you, but what we have seen in its place is the four largest budget deficits in the history of the Commonwealth, spending which is nearly $100 billion a year higher now than it was under the last year of the Howard government and, as I said, record and graphic waste and mismanagement. In fact, the interest bill alone is more than $20 million a day. The debt ceiling has been increased to $300 billion and Australians know that, if we did not have any debt repayments, we could build a major teaching hospital in every state capital of this country every year. Think about thatâ€”a new teaching hospital in every capital city every year, from the interest payments alone. Forget about paying back your $145 billion of net debt; I am talking about the interest payments. That is what is crippling the next generation. So I have no confidence that the Labor Party will be able to get government spending down from where it is today at 23.8 per cent of GDP. In the last year of the Howard-Costello government it was 23.1 per cent. You will not get that spending down. This Labor government has no plan to create jobs. When John Howard and Peter Costello came to office in March 1996, the unemployment rate was 8.4 per cent. When they left office in November 2007, the rate of unemployment was 4.5 per cent. Under this Gillard government, the unemployment rate has increased by one per cent to 5.4 per cent. Worse still, youth unemployment is reaching very, very disturbingly high levels: almost 14 per cent compared to the 9.8 per cent it was in November 2007. In fact, the unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians is even higher, rising to 18.1 per cent in 2010, from 13.8 per cent in 2007. Interestingly, the Labor Party does not believe in the Work for the Dole scheme. This was one of the great initiatives of the Howard government that Tony Abbott pushed so hard. In fact, the number of people on Work for the Dole has gone down from 22,362 in April 2005 to 12,789 as of 31 August 2012. When Wayne Swan, the Treasurer of this country, says to the Australian people, 'I will create 500,000 new jobs,' he has to explain why he has only created 186,000. Wayne, where are the 320,000 extra new jobs you promised? In fact, we the coalition, based on our record of economic success, will create one million new jobs over the next five years and two million jobs over the next decade. One of the great punishments for Australian businesses is the rising tax burden under this governmentâ€”27 new taxes. We know about the daddy of them all, the carbon tax, and we know about the great mining tax, which not only produced a risk to investment in this country but was so well-designed by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that it produced $126 million of revenueâ€”one tenth of what was promisedâ€”and they spent $50 million on its implementation. And they have promised $15 billion in expenditure for revenue that has not actually transpired. I can tell you about some other taxes that this government has overseen: the alcopops tax, a new tax on Australians working overseas, cuts to superannuation and increased taxes there, restrictions on business losses, changes to the employee share scheme, which is extremely regrettable because it acts a handbrake on innovation. The LPG excise increase, a cigarette tax increase, a luxury car tax increase, and, of course, do not forget the private health insurance rebate, which is now means tested. Let's not forget Nicola Roxon, the member for Gellibrand, and the Prime Minister promised on consecutive occasions that they would not touch private health insurance. They said to nearly half the country with private health insurance, 'We will not touch it.' But in the same way as the carbon tax was implemented without promising that at the last electionâ€”in fact, promising that we would never have oneâ€”so too with private health insurance. You promised you wouldn't touch it and you put a means test on the rebate. I could go onâ€”duty free tobacco, mature age worker offset, heavy vehicle user charge increases. It goes on and on. That is what this government has overseen. What it means is that you are taxing the Australian publicâ€”the businesses and families and individuals more. You would think you would have this ballooning revenue, but because you are stamping out innovation and industry and entrepreneurship, it means there is now a smaller economy than there should be. It means that you do not have the money to spend on important things like defence. Defence spending under this government has fallen to its lowest level since 1938â€”1.56 per cent of GDP. This is despite the fact that under the Howard government we kept defence spending at around two per cent of GDP, even when we had to pay back your $96 billion of debt in 1996. If you look around our region, it is not so quiet, is it? Today there is the fallout from the nuclear test in North Korea. We see an increase in tension between Japan and China and we know there are other obvious tensions in the area related to the Islamic terrorist threat. What has this government done in light of this growing need for a national security policy with conviction and with funding? It has cut defence spending. The Singaporeans are spending more than 3Â½ per cent of GDP on defence; the Indians more than two per cent; the South Koreans more than 2Â½ per cent; the Americans a whopping 4.7 per cent; and we are down to1.56 per cent. Madam Deputy Speaker, how do you explain that poor performance by this government? Our local defence industry has lost more than 5,000 jobs under the Labor government's term in office. It is just not good enough. When we focus on aspirational Australians, we are trying to encourage them to save. We are thinking about how can we get them to save for their retirement through superannuation, but you have reduced the concessional contribution tax, you have cut the government's super co-contributionâ€”which under the Howard government was $1,500â€”and you have cut it down to $500. You have basically put another $8 billion of taxes on the superannuation industry. Small business is doing it really tough under the tens and tens of thousands of new regulations that you have imposed. Red tape, green tape, whatever colour tape you want a name it, you have introduced more of that. There was the $1.4 billion blow out in the computers in schools program. There is a hidden hit list that the minister for education has got in his bottom drawer ready to pull out at a politically opportune time. The so-called Gonski proposal, which is completely unfunded, is part of your $120-billion black hole that this Labor government has when it comes to its finances. Industrial regulation is a particular interest of mine because I feel that under this Labor government we have a minister for the unions in the member for Maribyrnong. In fact he was called by Kathy Jackson of the HSU 'Dracula in charge of the blood bank'. That is what she called a fellow unionist in the member for Maribyrnong: Dracula in charge of the blood bank. You got rid of the ABCC, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, for an industry which employs 10 per cent of all Victorians, which has done so much to put a cop on the beat, to stamp out lawlessness in this important sector, and you allowed the Greens to come onto the floor of the chamber and propose even more radical amendments. Jac Nasser, the chairman of BHP, one of Australia's most notable largest companies, used BHP's Queensland coal business as an example of the increase in strikes and industrial disputation. He said there were 3,200 incidents of industrial action last year alone. And that there was an additional 500 notices withdrawing that action given on less than 24 hours notice. In fact the Fair Work Act has seen union power increase in more than 120 areas. This lack of flexibility, this lack of productivity, this increase in militancy is all a result of the increased regulation that the government has overseen in industrial relations. One of the other big problems of this government is scandals: the Craig Thomson scandal, the AWU scandal, the Peter Slipper scandal. They have reduced the public's confidence in our system. It has been unfortunately a plague on both houses but responsibility has not been on our side of the chamber; it has been on the other side of the chamber. I look at scandals related to the Australian network tender, the pink batts, the set-top boxes, the carbon tax advertising scheme, the border protection failuresâ€”more than 30,000 unauthorised arrivals and more than 500 boats. I tell you what is more rehearsed than a kabuki actor: it is not James Ashby, as was referred to by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs; it is this government and its very per poor performance because we all saw it coming."
