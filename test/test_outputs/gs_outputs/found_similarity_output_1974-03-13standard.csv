"No official warning of the outbreak was given. Certainly no knowledge of a warning reached me. No warning was given by my Department of this outbreak. There may have been some people who believed that they could predict the outbreak. The second part of the honourable senator's question is concerned with what department was responsible for not giving a public warning of the outbreak. Obviously an outbreak cannot be firmly predicted. Some evidence is coming forward now to suggest that the outbreak is associated with higher rainfall in northern parts of Australia which causes the southern movement of birds which sometimes settle in great numbers in areas such as the Murray Valley where there are insects which convey this disease. Infectious diseases, unless they are quarantinable diseases - this is not - are not the responsibility of the Australian Department of Health. I will ascertain more details as to what steps, if any, the States have taken in relation to prior notification and advise the honourable member of them. The final part of the honourable member's question is concerned with whether there is sufficient research into this disease. Again, this is primarily a matter for the States concerned, and principally Victoria. The Australian Government has provided assistance to Victoria to help in the investigation of the current outbreak. A request was made by the Victorian Minister of Health, Mr Scanlan, and I agreed to make available the services of Professor David Lee, of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, who is an authority on the transmission of this disease and who participated in research into an outbreak in 1951. A med i cad entomologist from the School, Mr Richard Russell, is assisting him. The John Curtin School of Medical Research of the Australian National University also is participating. A team headed by Dr Ian Marshall, a senior fellow in the Department of Microbiology, has gone to the Murray Valley to carry out virus isolation and anti-body studies on water fowl and mosquitoes. Also there has been assistance from Queensland - from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. Its Director, Dr Doherty, is a leading authority on arbor viruses; that is, viruses carried by insects and other arthropods. There have been recent Press reports that the attack is waning. I do not know whether this is correct. But I believe that there has been adequate response with the facilities available to us to investigate this disaster. If a need for further research is felt by the authorities, I am sure they will tell us about it.","17"
"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. Is it a fact that more than Sim has been allocated to Western Australia by the Australian Government for community and mental health services? What are the possibilities of increases in such allocations? Will these facilities alleviate the situation in which people are sued for recovery of medical fees? Will they remove the fear of bailiff seizure of goods from those unable to pay medical fees on genuine hardship grounds, such as has happened in my electorate?","1","2","12","17","18"
"Answering the last part of the question first, obviously if no charge is made the patient need not fear the bailiff. At some of these centres no charge is made. It depends on the funding arrangements entered into by the State and the local community health committee. Some of these centres have salaried doctors and in those cases normally no charge is made. The first question was whether further funds can be made available through the community health program. Yes, they can be. The program approved by the Government is for $7. 5m in each of 2 financial years - the current financial year and the coming financial year. So there is no reason why a program at least as large as the one that has been announced should not be forthcoming in the next financial year. The program for the present financial year provides about $590,000 for Western Australia out of a national grant totalling $7.5m. The nature of these mental health services depends upon projects proposed by the States. There is a wide range of them in the different States. Some have concentrated on hostels for the mentally handicapped, some on alcoholism services-","17","18"
"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister shortly will launch himself to ask that further questions be put on the notice paper. Up to the present, 50 minutes have elapsed and the question now being answered is only the twelfth for today. It has been a tranquil question time and there is no reason why 20 questions and answers could not have been achieved, except for the length of the answers given by Ministers. Mr Speaker, I ask through you, with your indulgence, whether the Prime Minister is willing to extend question time today by another 15 minutes.","18"

"That now discredited Labor Party election pamphlet entitled 'It's Time - Economics' asked the rhetorical question:","17"
"why has our rate of inflation grown so fast that the interest rate on money we save no longer even covers the loss from inflation?","4","6","17"
"That is a question far more pertinent to the current economic circumstances than it was in 1972 when the Labor Party sought to convince the electorate that it would not permit high interest rates. What are the facts today? The long-term bond rate is now set at 8.5 per cent. The overdraft rate is 1 per cent higher at 9.5 per cent. The whole structure of interest rates has risen dramatically throughout major lending areas such as housing finance and consumer credit. In short, interest rates are now at their highest level since Federation. Every national government in our history has managed the economy with interest rates lower than those now applying. No Federal Treasurer has permitted interest rates to rise to the levels set by the present incumbent. The so-called deliberate plan to reduce interest rates has been abandoned. The Government's pre-election commitment to a generally low interest rate structure has been dishonoured in the same way as many similar commitments have been dishonoured. The present level of interest rates is a reflection of this Government's economic mismanagement. The Bank of New South Wales, in its annual report published in January 1974, referred to the Government's policies in the following terms:","17"
"Oh","3","4","17"
"Well, every attempt that was made to do something to control the volume of money, to do something about the exchange rate, to do something about restricting the volume of money coming into Australia from overseas, to set up the Prices Justification Tribunal and to set up the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices has been resisted on that side of the House. What would honourable members opposite have done? I suggest that one of the big differences between Australia in 1973 and Australia in 1972 is that in 1973 we found 215,000 new jobs in this country while in 1971 only 70,000 new jobs were found. Honourable members opposite base their arguments on selected figures. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden), the former Treasurer, quoted figures on taxation yields when he spoke last night. But his figures were wrong and the sooner he stops inventing and circulating his own figures with high authority the better. One thing that does not seem to be understood by honourable members opposite is that there is a difference between average weekly earnings and total salaries and wages. There is a difference when we have a 4 per cent increase in the wage force as against one per cent as to what the total increase in wages and salaries should be. One thing that has astonished has been the quick increase in total employment, and the quickest source of employment has been the take-up in female employees. It is true that inflation is occurring under this Government just as it occurred under the previous Government. However, I think I had a little more honesty in economic argument when I was the shadow Treasurer than is shown by the present incumbent of that office because some of his argument is shoddy and shabby and reflects nothing much upon the so-called experts that he has assisting him. I would hope that my friend who is now sitting opposite on the front bench and who ought to know a little better might play a better part. He has taken no part in these fundamental economic debates. He has been conspicuous by his silence since he has been a member of this place. 1 think he should speak out and maybe he could do a little bit of educating amongst those opposite who are now the spokesmen on economic matters. Inflation is a serious business in this country as it is throughout the world. Australia is not unique in being the only possessor of inflation running at over double figures. Honourable members opposite should read the reports of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. They should read about what is happening in the United States of America and Japan. When Mr Heath was the Prime Minister of Great Britain 1 once suggested that the Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament ought to give his good advice to Mr Heath instead of giving it to me. I had the good fortune 12 months ago to meet the present Prime Minister of Great Britain and the present Chancellor of the Exchequer. I rather facetiously said to them, not thinking that they would be the occupiers of office in 1974, that they were criticising Mr Heath in Great Britain for much the same sort of things for which I was being criticised in Australia. I think it is time we got a little more objectivity into some of these fundamental debates. Honourable members opposite believe that inflation would have been less under their government than it is under our Government. I say that there is no evidence to support their case if the solutions which they now propound are any guide. Does anybody seriously believe in this country at the moment that a government could increase expenditure on defence by some hundreds of millions of dollars and at the same time reduce taxation by $500m to $600m. According to what the Leader of the Opposition said last night this is what should be done. But could anybody say this would make a serious contribution to halting inflation? I think the public is a little more sensible and I hope a little more sensitive to some of these issues than to believe the cheap sort of tedious tirade that we heard last night. Fancy taking 40 minutes to deliver that opus last night. We had a concerted attack by a potential Prime Minister of Australia, and he ought to be ashamed of it. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about taxation yield. How does he know what the yield of income tax will be at 30 June 1974? Yet, he airily goes on record as saying that it will be $500m to $600m more than I have budgeted for. I say now that that is nonsense, and the quicker it is seen to be nonsense the sooner we will get on to sensible discussion.","17"

"Yes. I have been misrepresented by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) in many ways, but I will deal with only one subject. He claimed that I had wrongly stated my expectations of the increase in personal income tax collections for this year as compared with last year. I gave a figure of $l,500m.","2","4"
"It is not the figure. You are saying that it will be $500m greater than was estimated in the Budget, and you are wrong. You cannot substantiate it.","3","4"
"As the right honourable gentleman would know, I have been watching fairly carefully to make sure that he did not stray too far from the subject. Of course, traditionally the Leader of the Opposition has always been given a fair amount of leeway. But I think it is important that the right honourable gentleman get to the point as to how he has been misrepresented. He should make his explanation as brief as possible.","17"
"In the course of his remarks the Treasurer (Mr Crean) brought out one of the fundamental differences in economic management between those of us on this side of the House and honourable members on the Government side. He referred to the fundamental division of the Australian community into 2 prime groups. He saw the 2 groups as those who employ labour and those who are employees. We on this side of the House do not look at that division as being the prime grouping of the Australian community. Rather we see the division as being between those who are involved in productive enterprise, and those who are involved in the service enterprises. We see the division as being between those who are in the work force and those who are unable to be in the work force. We do not see those who are employed as being in any different relationship to the community from those who are employers. Certainly, for industrial reasons, there are very good and valid bases for contending that it is necessary for communication to be improved between those who are employees and those who are employers. That I do not dispute. But I think it is important that we recognise that out of this assessment of the 2 prime groupings of the community, the Treasurer and those who frame the economic policy of this Government are pursuing a course which is directly contributing to inflation; a course which very much relates to the matter now a subject of debate in this chamber - the imposition by the Government of the highest and most onerous interest rates since federation. The fundamental objective of this Government which has been expressed on many occasions by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and the Treasurer has been to divert resources from the private sector into the public sector. The Government's policy has been to try to curb the growth of the private sector and to divert funds that would otherwise be spent in the private sector into the public sector so that the Government might pursue both the policies which it has embarked on in the broad and so that it can implement its own socialist philosophy which in essence means the diversion from the private individual into the public sector of much of the sinews of economic action. Might I just say before I go any further in terms of an analysis of the consequences of high interest rates; the management of the economy and the stratagems of this Government that it is most unfortunate that the Treasurer saw fit to criticise my colleague, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Edwards)? He hopes to participate in this debate. I trust that he will be given a chance to participate in the debate. I thought it ill behoved the Treasurer to suggest that the honourable member for Berowra was not privy to the economic judgments and assessments of those who speak on economic matters on this side of the House. Indeed, the honourable member for Berowra is quite capable and willing to speak for himself.","12"
"He is on the list of speakers. He is the next person who is willing to speak. If he is not on the speakers list it would only be because the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) has suggested that the debate should be reduced, rather than extended to 3 speakers from each side as normally is the case. I direct the attention of the House to the 2 particular respects in which the consequences of a high interest rate are most apparent. The first is the degree to which it is reducing the initiatives and endeavours of those in the private sector of the economy and diverting funds from the private sector into the public sector so that the Government can pursue its programs. This of course is manifest in several ways. The second respect is the impact that high interest rates have had on the ordinary men and women in the Australian community in pushing up the costs of everything they want to do and in denying them the opportunity to build homes and to do many of those things which as Australians we have come to expect as a result of years of sound and wise economic management by governments from this side of the House. There are several areas wherein the application of inflation can be seen. I was delighted that the Treasurer recognised that it is not peculiarly a matter of looking at the Australian economy. It is also necessary that we recognise the energy crisis and the impact that it has had on our trade opportunities, the slackening production rates, the shortages of importable products and the problems of increased costs in shipping and bunkering which affect freight rates. There are the very real problems that flow through from the level of industrial disputes which have cost so much in lost wages and in the number of lost working days and the degree to which those lost wages and lost working days have increased this year and last year as compared with 1972. Then, of course, there is the direct diversion by this Government of the number of people employed in the Commonwealth Public Service. There has been a significant increase in this number. Between November 1972 and August 1973, the increase was 4.1 per cent, equivalent to an increase of over 5 per cent in a 12 month period. At the same time, employment in private industry over that same 9 months period increased by only 2.1 per cent, or a little over 50 per cent of the growth rate of the Public Service. These are only a few of the manifestations of inflation. Yet in spite of the necessity for a broad based attack on inflation, the Government is pursuing a policy which at the moment covers currency revaluation - .that seems to be the core of one of the advocates of the Prime Minister as to the way by which inflation can be contained - and an attempt to divert resources from the private sector into the public sector. That objective is won by the application of high interest rates. The very success of the February loan which collected the record amount of $509m demonstrates that because high interest rates are being offered there is a tendency for funds to be invested in the public sector rather than the private sector which means, of course, that the Government is able to finance its program while private enterprise cannot. However, the real problem as I see it affects the productive sector of the economy, its ability to plan ahead and the confidence that it no longer has. The degree to which this sector is able to afford to borrow funds has been seriously affected by the Government's lack of ability adequately to control inflation. There are 2 particular ways in which the little man in the productive enterprises has been particularly affected. One is in the degree to which funds have been diverted from savings banks. I think it is very material that the result of having high interest rates applied to Commonwealth loans and the degree to which the bond rate has been increased has been that funds have been diverted away from areas from which private enterprise might normally work into areas from which the Government can work. I think it is of relevance that on 10 January this year in the 'Australian Financial Review', Mr R. B. Cameron, the Director of the Australian Bankers' Association Research Directorate was reported as saying:","12"
"In the first 9 months of 1973, savings bank deposits increased at an average monthly rate of S171 million. Growth in savings bank deposits in October and November has been affected by the changes in interest rate structures flowing from the monetary policies adopted by the Government last September. Savings bank lending for housing has been under moderate official restraint in recent months. . . . The lower level of lending in November also reflects the influence of recent lower deposit growth. Nevertheless, savings banks are continuing to assist as many home buyers as is possible.","12"
"There are 2 consequences of that situation. One is that people are not being encouraged to save, certainly not in savings banks, because as my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) effectively demonstrated, at their present rate of return and at the present level of inflation, people are losing about 11 per cent per annum on funds invested in savings bank deposits. The other consequences of the diversion of funds from savings banks is the degree to which funds are diverted from investment in the housing sector. It is important that we recognise that housing expenditure is tremendously important both in social terms and in economic terms and the effect of the high interest rate policy of this Government has been to divert funds from housing expenditure both in the availability of funds from savings banks and the cost of funds to the small investor. The. potential home owner faces a very bleak future. In an article in the Sydney Sun' of 12 March 1974 'the costs were shown to be of such an order that it would be impossible for a man receiving average weekly earnings of $125 to buy a home using traditional sources of finance. It is in this way that the application of this Government's policy is diverting funds in a negative fashion from sources which would enable this country to grow. So, the raising by the Opposition of this matter of public importance has not been done in a negative sense. Rather, our action is designed to point at the ill consequences of this Government's mismanagement of the economy. The Treasurer himself failed to demonstrate this afternoon that high interest rates benefit the community. He failed to produce a way in which inflation can be controlled.","12"
"The Minister's time has expired. The discussion is concluded.","17"
"Mr Deputy Speaker, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, the International Monetary Agreements Bill proposes that Australia should take up an additional entitlement of 341 shares in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. These shares have a value of approximately $A28m, of which only 10 per cent - say $2.8m - will be required to bring Australia's total equity in the bank to $643m, of which $64m has been provided in cash. The bank borrows on fairly favourable terms on that equity investment and passes on those favourable terms to the recipients of its activities (which are the poorer member countries of the bank) in order, as the Treasurer (Mr Crean) said in his speech, to encourage the best rate of economic growth and development. I had the pleasure of visiting, with considerable interest, some officers of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in December last year. The Bank makes loans broadly speaking, on commercial terms for economic projects related to capital works, water, transport, power and production. More recently, when the Bank has engaged in a wider range of activities, more emphasis has been placed on the social implications, and necessarily less emphasis has been placed on economically viable projects. I do not think that it is possible to express a view on this fairly recent tendency. One would have to look at each project on its merits to see, how : sound it is and really hOw beneficial it is in its social objectives. But I cannot say that this tendency worries me as much as it does some people who have expressed concern about this matter. I believe that the Government is acting properly in making this increased equity contribution and that it regards the officers of the Bank as being the best people to decide what projects they should assist. As has been stated, the IBRD is easily the biggest development finance body in the world, and I for one - and I think the Opposition as a whole - certainly agree to the Bill and to the comments which the Treasurer made in his second reading speech. I was pleased to see his reference to the bipartisan support of the Bank which has existed down the years. Also, I see nothing against the discussions with the IBRD on payments to and from the Bank because of the 'maintenance of value' provisions resulting from the revaluation of the Australian dollar as against the United States dollar. The Treasurer and the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) referred to the reason why Australia has not taken up the shares previously. The Treasurer in his second reading speech said that it was because of budgetary restraint. But it ought to be mentioned in passing that previously a number of countries - most countries - did not immediately take up their share entitlements. Many of them have since done so, although some have not. I certainly think that the time is now appropriate to take up the share entitlement and, as the honourable member for Gellibrand mentioned, perhaps it could be even a little bit later than it should have been. He emphasised this point, and although he said in another context that he did not want to get into a controversial area, that has not really been noticeable to honourable members on this side of the chamber on other occasions. He has never passed up the opportunity to criticise the Opposition or the previous Government. He did it on this occasion. The situation is, as he said, one of priorities. The present Government took great pride in having introduced 236 Bills into this House last year. So presumably the priority that it attached to this Bill ranked at least 237th or a little lower because some other Bills have already been introduced this session. This is the sort of thing that does not get either side of the House very far. The point of his that I want to take up - and I want to speak for only another 2 or 3 minutes - is that in discussing the whole aid question the honourable member for Gellibrand made an impassioned plea for more funds to be spent. He singled out one country - the United States of America - for criticism. I do not know whether that is ideological, but surely we have to recognise the fact that the United States has been the most generous country when it has come to the question of providing assistance in aid and by other means to other countries.","12","17"

"I listened with interest to the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Oldmeadow), if only because he attempted to perpetuate an illusion that we have seen dragged through this House to date when he referred to the fact that this was the Queen's Speech and attempted to imply that it was the Speech of Her Majesty and not the Speech written for her by the Government. This is something that should not have to be emphasised, but I make this introduction because I wish to draw attention to a number of sins of omission and sins of commission that are mentioned in this Speech delivered by Her Majesty for the Government. The major sin of omission since this Government came into office has been in relation to the most important question of inflation. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) demonstrates clearly the problem that has occurred since the former Government lost office. That amendment includes the words:","17"
"the House of Representatives is of the opinion and regrets that your Majesty was not informed by the Government of the true position in Australia in that it has: created an intolerably high level of inflation and has taken no effective steps to stop it; caused uncertainty and in its management of the economy is creating social inequalities;","12","17"
"I think it was somewhat damning of the Government that the Leader of the Opposition was able to speak yesterday and to read in full a quotation from the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) which indicated that he, at least, was aware of the problems that inflation creates. If I paraphrase what he said, it is not because I wish to quote him out of context. He mentioned the important factor of altering the distribution of income in an arbitrary and often vicious way. He mentioned that inflation robs people by reducing the purchasing power of their savings, distorts resource allocation and encourages a rush into supposedly inflation-proof real assets such as land or housing. The Prime Minister said that inflation is anathema to us all. In that respect I agree with him, as I am certain would every responsible member of this Parliament, because inflation is a real problem that causes a great deal of dislocation in the community. I was, therefore, most distressed yesterday to hear the Treasurer (Mr Crean), the person who is responsible for the administration of our economy, attempt to deny that inflation at a rate of 14 per cent, as we all acknowledge we have today, is not intolerable. In answer to a question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) the Treasurer, at page 249 of Hansard, is reported as having said:","17"

"There is the true picture of what has happened to Australia since this Government came to. power. I ran through some matters very quickly. Let me now go through them in more detail. The first is the matter of defence. What has happened to the defence of this country since this Government came into power? The morale of the defence services of this country has never been lower. Yet the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) comes into this House and says literally that everything in the defence sphere is lovely. I say quite frankly that, if he thinks that, it shows that he knows nothing about the defence services and nothing about the factors relating to the defence of this country. Let him go out to some of the defence installations in Australia and talk to the servicemen who are engaged there. He will then find out their feelings about what this Government has done to the defence of the country. Much has been said about the association of the previous Government with the United States of America. I have mentioned this before. Previously, if we had things to say to leaders in the United States they were said in private and not blazoned as headlines in the newspapers of the world so that everybody could see our differences.","17"

"The honourable member for Petrie was disparaging the efforts of the Australian Government in the flood situation in Queensland. Let me remind the honourable member of my own modest involvement because I did not go to Queensland to make any Press statements and, in fact, I did not. What I did was to meet the Lord Mayor and the Minister for Housing to make offers and overtures to him in relation to assistance for housing in that area. I offered the Minister 200 emergency accommodation places in the Commission hostel called Wacol. We offered him the resources of the Federal Department of Housing and Construction to co-ordinate the flow of materials to assist with the restoration of houses in that area. Regrettably, we have not had much response. We went to check the situation in respect of the defence Services homes insurance scheme. I have told the House that in that regard we have an impeccable record with about $2m worth of claims met by the defence Services homes insurance scheme despite the sorry record of some of the private insurance companies. Then, of course, there is the question of the unbridled support of the defence Services. There is no need for me to talk about that. There is the fact that 5600,000 was made available to public relief funds and that there was an immediate declaration made about donations being tax deductible if they were over $2. Then, of course, there was the willing response of the Federal Government in regard to the providing of immediate relief for families amounting to $3,000 a family and $15,000 a household in respect of major repairs. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) who is fairly new among us may not be very much aware of the niggardly attitude that characterised the previous administration in regard to disaster relief. Relief was to the effect of a dollar for dollar subsidy. I might add that the Queensland Government is likely to spend $2m, so that Government could attract $2m under the criteria which the honourable member for Parramatta seems willing to uphold. Do honourable members opposite expect us to stand for this nonsense when this Government has seen the floods as a genuine humane and priority issue and has given an almost open-ended commitment to the relief of the situation in Queensland? Do honourable members know that already we have indicated our preparedness to back the State in the restoration of State assets? Do honourable members opposite know that we have already spent $9m and that probably we will go on to spend 4 or 5 times that amount and that in respect of the second episode there was no quibbling and Addling around as to how much it would cost? The Prime Minister of this country spoke affirmatively on behalf of the Parliament of the nation and the people of the nation when he said: These human demands have to be met'. So, we are going along with that kind of enthusiasm and neither I nor any Government supporter on this side of the House is prepared to listen to the hum buggery and the nonsense that has been meted out by the honourable member for Petrie. (Quorum formed.) I did not intend to talk about those things but it seemed to me that the record needed to be put straight. I am very concerned also with the misrepresentation by the Leader of the Opposition in respect of the matters associated with my own responsibility. What the Leader of the Opposition has been saying in regard to the housing situation does not fairly represent the facts. He has been talking about approvals and commencements. He has been contending that they are down this year. What he has not said, of course, is that more houses were under construction in 1973 than in 1972, the last year of Liberal-Country Party government. He has been criticising me in respect of some of the statements attributed to me, particularly in last Sunday's 'SunHerald'. I noticed that he made a statement during the course this afternoon when he referred to my -","17"

"The Postmaster-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has given way to me tonight because I have a statement to make relating to charges made against me personally in the South Australian House of Assembly, so he is not here to answer the extraordinary charges of the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron). On Tuesday, 26 February, behind the cloak of parliamentary privilege in the South Australian House of Assembly, Mr R. Hall, M.P., who heads the Liberal Movement there, made allegations concerning the standard of auditing of recent financial statements of the Storemen and Packers Union, South Australian Branch, conducted by my firm, C. J. Hurford and Co., Chartered Accountants. His language was so outrageous as to include the words 'deliberately covered up the facts of the misappropriation of money that took place in that union's affairs', and 'the firm of C. J. Hurford and Co. should be delicensed'. The cowardly character of this baseless charge is witnessed by the fact that Mr Hall has refused to repeat the damaging words in public so that I can clear my name through the courts. As I returned from a study tour of North America only on the day the attack was made, I am reminded vividly of problems there. Mr Hall 's standards are the same as those of the persons who perpetrated the Watergate evils. They may be summarised as through enough dirt, act sufficiently excessively, do not worry about the truth and public morality - all that matters is political gain'. These are standards of the gutter and should not be tolerated here. As the sole principal of C. J. Hurford and Co., I accept the responsibility for the conduct of the audits of the Storeman and Packers financial statements, including the actions of the persons entrusted by me to undertake the detailed audit work and its supervision. I assert that the audits were conducted without . fear or favour, with due diligence and professional skill and that in no way was my firm or its employees professionally or in any other way negligent. Indeed I believe we went well beyond the normal calls of duty in order to achieve satisfactory standards. My firm was called in as auditors of the Storemen and Packers Union, South Australian Branch, in August 1972 - not in May 1972 as alleged by Mr Hall in his inaccurate statement. Already the inadequacy of the bookkeeping was well known. The previous auditor, Mr J. Richards, chartered accountant, had stated the facts in his reports. The Federal Secretary of the Union, Mr Jack Petrie, had carried out a thorough personal examination in May 1972, and had reported his judgments. In August 1972 my firm was requested to undertake the specific task of preparing a receipts and payments statement to 30 June 1972, recording what did actually go into and come out of the branch's bank account and records. This was done. We were not given authority to draw up a balance sheet as at 30 June 1972, that is 2 months prior to our being called in, and this was said in our report. Balance sheets had not previously been prepared for this branch of this union, nor are they required by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. However, to maintain our usual standards, my firm prepared and reported on a balance sheet as at 30 June 1973 - the only financial year which has been fully under our control. From the day C. J. Hurford and Co. became auditors of this South Australian branch of this union, we brought to the attention of the branch committee at meetings and the members of the union in the published audit reports distributed at the annual meeting and posted on notice boards at every major work centre the inadequacies and irregularities in the accounts and records. Remedies were put into effect in January 1973 and we have not encountered problems since. To substantiate this, we need go no further than draw attention to the financial statements and auditors' reports themselves. The reports include the following statements:","17"
"That was a report with receipts and payments statement for the 6 months ended 30 June 1972. Statements in the report with receipts and payments statement for the 6 months ended 31 December 1972 read:","17"
"Internal control procedures covering cash receipts, as laid down, have not been carried out and accordingly we are unable to state whether the $16,257.92 members' contributions credited to the bank account represent all contributions actually collected from members. Internal control procedures covering cash payments, as laid down, have not been carried out, viz., that certain withdrawals of union funds have not been correctly authorised or supervised, nor is there sufficient documentary evidence to substantiate some of the expenditure.","4","6","17"
"These two further statements were included in the report with the balance sheet as at 30 June 1973 and with the receipts and payments statement for the 12 months ended on that date. They read:","17"
"Proper books of account were not kept during the period July to December 1972. We were unable to satisfy ourselves that all receipts and payments of the union for the period July-December 1972 have been correctly recorded.","4","6","17"
"Any objective, unbiased, reasonable person will realise that these are not reports of a firm covering up any facts whatsoever. Behind the cloak of parliamentary privilege unsubstantiated charges were made by Mr Hall against Mr J. H. Doyle, who carried out the detailed work on this audit for my firm. They relate to what he is alleged to have said at branch committee meetings. They are utterly denied by Mr Doyle and are the subject of a separate statement prepared by him. If I do not get time to do so, I hope that my colleague, the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun), will read Mr Doyle 's statement. He is a most diligent man of integrity, has my utmost confidence and respect - so much so that I am seeking to hand over the few audits which are done by C. J. Hurford and Co. to him, due of course, to my lack of time and increasing responsibilities elsewhere. None of us associated with this audit are prepared to join Mr Hall in his unsubstantiated and thus irresponsible claims that there has been 'embezzlement and misappropriation of funds in that union'. My firm reported fully on unsatisfactory administrative procedures from the day we took over. We co-operated completely with a police investigation over 6 months ago. Whether a felony had been committed or whether the problem was due to inexperience and a lack of administrative training and ability had to be left to the judgment of those to whom the auditors report, namely the union members and their representatives on the branch management committee. The auditors reported fully and their clients made their judgment. If Mr Hall had confined his remarks to the need for union administrative training facilities and for possible alterations to Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Acts to bring their financial requirements in line with the Companies Acts, he would have been following me and my Labor colleagues in what we have been seeking to achieve. I personally, have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours of my spare time in promoting the Workers Educational Authority of South Australia, which has done much pioneering work in trade union education. I and my accounting colleagues have spent hundreds and hundreds of non-chargeable hours in improving the accounts and records of trade unions. The Labor Party in Federal and State spheres has made giant strides in the last few years in appropriating funds to improve trade union education facilities so that the working man may be helped, not hindered, and industrial peace may be facilitated. But there is not much publicity in this. We do, however, have the satisfaction of knowing that we have achieved something and have not used the despicable method of muddying the names of innocent persons for political purposes. I am glad to have been able to make this statement for the record, although I regret that the forms of the South Australian Parliament did not allow the State member for Adelaide to make this statement in the South Australian House of Assembly yesterday where it would have been better/ understood and also that the forms of this House have prevented me making this statement earlier. However, let it be known that I am also issuing this statement outside the Parliament. I do not need the protection of privileges. I stand behind each word and do not resort, as Mr R. Steele Hall, M.P., has resorted, to Watergate type lies and excesses to achieve my political purpose. I hope that my colleague, the honourable member for Kingston, will have a few moments before the adjournment to read the statement from Mr J. H. Doyle.","17"

Doyle supplementary to that made by the honourable member for Adelaide concerning charges made by Mr R.

Because of the lack of time available to me, I ask permission to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.","12","17"

"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No. (a) No. The precise lines of demarcation between the two services have not yet been established. This matter was however discussed at the Conference of Aboriginal Legal Services held in Canberra on 3-4 December 1973 which was attended by representatives of the Aboriginal Legal Services and by officers of the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The Australian Legal Aid Office will provide assistance to all persons in need including Aboriginals. Individual Aboriginals will have the choice of approaching either the Australian Legal Aid Office or the Aboriginal Legal Service for assistance.","17"
