"I think every honourable member is concerned at the high incidence of traffic accidents, particularly at level crossings and especially as so many regrettably result in the death of some of the people involved. I am not sure whether these accidents can be related entirely to driver error. In some circumstances I think it is a matter of road design. I am certain that the increasing trend by railway and road constructing authorities to build overpasses and underpasses will reduce considerably the incidence of accidents at level crossings. I thank the honourable member and other honourable members who have referred to me the submission by the Country Women's Association of Victoria that consideration should be given to placing some type of reflector on Commonwealth Railways vehicles to enable motor car drivers more readily to observe those vehicles. I shall certainly bring the honourable member's suggestion to the attention of the Commissioner for Commonwealth Railways with a view to seeing whether the dangers and difficulties now presented by moving transports can be reduced.","12"

"Mr Deputy Speaker, first I should like to join other honourable members from both sides of the House who have preceded me in this debate in expressing my deep regret at the death of the former Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt, in such tragic and unprecedented circumstances. Although I disagreed with his politics, that did not prevent me from liking his personality and character, which were exemplified by his friendly attitude to all members irrespective of their party affiliation. I extend my sincere sympathy to Mrs Holt and to her family.  Prior to commenting on the Government's policy as enunciated by the Governor-General in his Speech last week - or perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that I shall comment on what was omitted from the Speech - I wish to refer to the debate on the alleged water torture incident in Vietnam, which took place in this House last Thursday evening. As honourable members are aware, only a limited number of speakers were allowed during that debate. As a consequence, I can contribute to the discussion on that subject only by making passing reference to it now. I submit that the proposition put to the House per medium of the amendment to the -motion that the House take note of the paper which was moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) and which was rejected by the Government, was a sound and reasonable one. That amendment called for a full and open court of inquiry presided over by a judge appointed by the Government. It had the support of several newspapers which no one could deem to be pro-Labor. When this matter was first brought to light, similar Press statements were issued by the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) and the Minister for the Army (Mr Lynch) suggesting that an inquiry would be held. However, last Thursday evening, the Government's attitude completely somersaulted and it refused to appoint an inquiry. This has confused a great number of people who well may ask: What is the reason behind it all? It is crystal clear that the Prime Minister, in his speech last Thursday evening, set out to mitigate the seriousness of the incident. It was noticeable that no Government speaker endeavoured to give an answer on one paramount point, although this unfortunate incident occurred in October 1966. The Government, so we are informed, was completely unaware of the incident until it was revealed recently by a journalist of the Melbourne 'Herald*. This immediately prompts the thought: Have similar methods of obtaining information been used prior to or since October 1966? I fully appreciate the fact that the safety and well being of Australian troops in any theatre of war are of the utmost importance and concern to us all. I believe that all possible means should be used to extract vital information from captured enemy prisoners, provided that the means used do not breach the Geneva Convention. However, we must be mindful of the fact that the Australian Parliament unanimously accepted the terms of the Convention and that while the ratifying statute remains on the statute book it must be obeyed to the letter. The alternative is anarchy. The Prime Minister emphasised that the captured Vietnamese woman was an agent. I do not question that for one moment, but under the terms of the Geneva Convention an agent is a prisoner and must be treated as such. The crime is punishable by death, but only if the person is found guilty by a just and democratic trial. The Australian people were horrified by the treatment, cruelty and privation suffered by Australian and allied prisoners during World War II. This was the type of barbarism which prompted the Geneva Convention. An endeavour was made to prevent it happening in the future. It is not my intention to refer extensively tj the war in Vietnam. But I shall deal with what 1 believe was a major cause ot the war. I refer to the failure of various regimes in South Vietnam to implement a policy of land reform. Let us examine the position where land reform was implemented in other countries. During the early post war period following World War II General MacArthur commenced the democratisation of Japan. One of his most important initial steps was the introduction of land reform. This step was taken as a buffer against the possibility of Communism taking over in that country. The average size of a farm which was allotted to each family was 2i acres. In June 1965 I was one of the delegation of seven parliamentarians which was lead by the present Minister for Air (Mr Freeth) and which visited several South East Asian countries, including Taiwan where land reform was introduced in 1954. Prior to its introduction the absentee landlord received up to 60% of the value of farm production. Now the maximum amount payable is 36% which, in my opinion, is still a little high. However, it is much better than hitherto. The delegation was shown the primary production graphs before and after land reform, which revealed skyrocketing production figures. The benefits have been twofold. Over 80% of primary producers now own their own properties and Taiwan has a favourable trade balance. It does not receive financial aid from the United States of America or from other countries. This proves beyond all doubt that people who are subjected to exploitation and abject poverty will, if given the opportunity and incentive, improve their own living standards and at the same time contribute to vastly improved national economies in their countries. Honorable members who were in this Parliament prior to the 1966 election will recall the speech made by the President of the United States of America, Lyndon Johnson, at the luncheon tendered to him by the Government. The President reminded us that hundreds of millions of people in this world are existing on less than $1 per week. That simply means they are starving. Is it any wonder there are so many trouble spots in the world today when such privation exists? I believe that many of the underprivileged people living in abject poverty in underdeveloped countries are not concerned greatly with Communism, Fascism or democracy. They will certainly support any sort of Government which will provide them with a reasonable standard of living. I ask honorable members to put themselves in the position of these people who have not enough food for their wives and families and have very little hope for the future. What would honorable members do? I venture to say they would do exactly as those people are doing. They would be striving for something better, and as I mentioned earlier, one of the initial steps in bringing this to fruition is land reform. Now I shall refer to social service and repatriation benefits. It is interesting to note that the Government's policy contained in the Governor-General's Speech approximated 3,400 words, yet only 73 words were devoted to these benefits. The relevant section of the Speech reads as follows:","12","17"
"My Government will review the field of social welfare with the object of assisting those in most need while at the same time not discouraging thrift, self-help and self-reliance.  To this end my Government will set up a Standing Cabinet Committee including the Ministers for Health, Social Services, Repatriation and Housing, and that Committee will direct its attention to co-ordinating the approaches jnd proposals of the various Departments concerned with social welfare.","12"
"Those words, when closely analysed, mean that there will be few, if any, benefits given to the pensioner. Let us examine what the Prime Minister said a few days prior to the Liberal Party ballot for the Prime Ministership. He made a few points, one of which was as follows:","12"
"If I was able to frame the nation's future policies I would aim at a society which would remove burdens and fear from the shoulders of those in dire need.","12"
"The Mascot Executive Officers and members of this sub-branch wish to bring your attention to the alarming decrease in pension values for returned servicemen.  In the 17 years the present Government has been in office, war pensions have been allowed to deteriorate so that now the total and permanent incapacity war pension is 81% of the minimum wage. The highest rate for partial disablement is 32% of the same wage. The RSL can stress the justice of its requests and point out that the debt owed by the nation to these people is not resolved and despite all else, the claims of those who today are still handicapped due to service for their country are surely entitled to a priority. These facts are the firm beliefs of the members whose names are on this petition. We sincerely believe you as our Labor representative will be sympathetic to our cause for a better deal in pensions, and hope you may in some way be able to make this present Federal Government see the folly and hardships that are imposed on service pensioners- after all, they are only pensioners because they thought fit to fight for this great young country, and to keep us all free.","12"
"That is perfectly true. When was the last great effort to refer powers en masse to this Parliament? lt was in 1942, at the height of the war, when the then Attorney-General, the tate Dr Evatt , and the late Mr Curtin as Prime Minister called upon the States to refer to the Commonwealth Parliament powers in relation to 14 points. Those 14 points virtually covered the field. The proposal was that the powers should be referred on a 5-year basis. In other words, we were to have Socialism on appro. That was the arrangement. But the constitutional convention failed. If I may I will read only one small extract from a speech made on this point by Dr Evatt at the constitutional convention in 1942. He appealed to a Mr Watts not to press an amendment to a particular point because it fenced in a particular proposal and he said:","17"
"Mr Bury said: 'Until some 3 years ago average wages in real terms were rising year by year, sustained by heavy investment and progressive improvements in productivity. This has since ceased to be the case largely because the Government has been obliged by events to make greater demands for real resources in large part, but not wholly, to meet the rapidly increasing requirements for defence'.","12","17"
"I could go along with the final remarks of the honourable member for Bennelong (Sir John Cramer) in regard to amalgamating Australia and New Zealand as one nation. Sir Leslie Munro, to whom the honourable member referred, is a strong advocate of this and is a very prominent and notable New Zealander. I, together with the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) and other members of this House, had the pleasure of Sir Leslie 's company at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Uganda late last year.  During his remarks, the honourable member for Bennelong referred to the development of water resources in Australia. He said that we have only a certain capacity. Obviously by this he meant only a certain capacity to pay. One can understand from the bungling of this Government why its capacity to develop these things is very limited. One matter that is particularly disturbing to many Australians as they learn and study the implications, is the bungling of this Government in regard to the purchase of the Fill bomber. Before I mention anything further in regard to this grievous bungling, I want at the outset of my remarks to pay tribute to the former Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt. Whilst we on this side of the House - myself in particular - at times strongly disagreed with some of his political policies, I think that we all had a deep affection for him as a man. I recall that not long after my coming into the Parliament that he wrote to my aged mother and paid her a compliment on my being elected as the representative of the electorate of Hunter. The Prime Minister said that although he thought my stay here would be a lengthy one, this would be a matter for my electors. But he also said he thought I would make many friends here. I believe I have achieved what he told my mother I would do. He has gone and I express deep sympathy to his near and dear ones. I now refer to the purchase of the Fill bomber and the bungling and inability of the Government to carry out many of the things that we on this side of the House would like to see carried out. I want to remind honourable members and others present in the galleries of the terrific waste of public moneys in connection with the purchase of the Fill bomber. In 1963, because of the fear that the Opposition would attack it because of its lack of a proper strike aircraft to defend Australia, the Government very hurriedly, shortly before the 1963 elections, sent the late Mr Athol Townley, who was then Minister for Defence, to the United States of America to purchase a number of bombers. The quoted price for two squadrons of Fill aircraft was $ 110.4m. Three years later the price had soared to $182m. Seven months later in July 1966 the price then quoted to the Australian Government was $192m.","17"
"Yes, as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has said, it is cost plus. In 1967 the price quoted for the bombers was $194m. In May 1967 the estimated price that the Australian Government had arrived at was $2 13m. The former Minister for Air, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Howson), refused to comment on a suggestion that the maximum price would be about $300m. Is it any wonder that the Government and the honourable member for Bennelong say that we have only a certain capacity to pay for certain things? I believe this is one of the greatest bungles that any Australian government has perpetrated on the people for many years.  My intention today is to concentrate the greater portion of my time on a very grave injustice that was discussed by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr J. R. Fraser) and myself in debates in this House on 10th and 11th May last year. Reference to this matter appears on pages 2009-15, 2021, 2022-3 and 2064-8 of Hansard. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory and myself were deeply stirred about the grievous injustice meted out to a very fine type of Australian who belonged to the Australian Capital Territory Police Force. The person to whom I refer is Mr Charles Upston, who is an ex-sergeant of the Australian Capital Territory Police. I think this an appropriate time to raise this matter again because there has been a change in the administration of the Australian Capital Territory Police - it is now administered by a man who I believe is more fair minded - and a change in the Interior portfolio. The present Minister is the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon). Whilst honourable members would appreciate my remarks about the passing of the late Prime Minister, I point out that the late Prime Minister made a decision in connection with this matter. To my mind, Sergeant Upston was rail-roaded, in the very worst sense of the word, out of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force. Honourable members will recall my reference to this man's great qualities. He is a great father, husband and citizen. He had been commended for police.manship over the 15 years he had been a member of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force. He had been commended for rescuing persons from flooded rivers and persons who had become mentally deranged and had threatened to jump off tall buildings in Canberra. He was also a qualified pilot in the Citizen Air Force, qualified motor mechanic and a qualified skin diver. The gun was virtually held at his head, to compel him to resign, by the then Commissioner of Police, Mr Powley , who he had chafed somewhat some 10 months before. His resignation was demanded. He chafed the Commissioner of Police by having a decision made by him altered. The Commissioner intended to promote about five other junior officers over Sergeant Upston. The wrong that Sergeant Upston committed at that time was to take his appeal to the Police Arbitral Tribunal. Before he had tendered all his evidence in support of his appeal the Chairman of the Tribunal, Mr Findlay, ended the case by saying: 'I want to hear no more of your evidence. You will be promoted in accordance with your rank and in preference to the other five applicants.' Anyone who knows how police forces function will realise that this decision would cause a commissioner of police like Mr Powley deep hurt. About 10 months after Sergeant Upston had won his appeal, while off duty one day he went to a vacant paddock in Canberra between here and the airport to attend to a pony that he had bought for his children. As he left the paddock he saw a car driven in a reckless manner by a senior officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Sergeant Upston's attention was drawn to this vehicle because it could have collided with his car. He spoke to the official from the CSIRO in a courteous manner and the official replied, as I understand that he admitted in a letter of complaint to the Police Commissioner: What are you bunging on? What are you trying to do?' As a result of this verbal altercation Sergeant Upston said: 'I will report you to your senior officer in charge at the CSIRO because you do not reflect credit on that branch'. He could easily have taken legal action and probably arrested the CSIRO official for offensive language or for a breach of the traffic laws, but he sought to act in the humane manner for which he is noted.","17"
"Quite stunned; most upset. The philosophy which animated the Government's decision to proceed with the Nogoa scheme should be appreciated. Anybody who examined the scheme and made calculations on the primary costs of the scheme and the benefits that would flow 'from it must have known that there were some doubts about the scheme. There still are: There are doubts as to the crops. There are doubts about markets. There are doubts about precise river flow measurements. There are doubts about the capacity of the soil to do what it was hoped it would be able to do under intensive irrigation in the long term. But, there being some doubts, the Government said: 'Primary costs and benefits are important and significant, but we will harness the energies which people have so as to overcome some of the difficulties which the figures seem to indicate may exist'. The Government made not only an economic decision but a social decision. It decided to take a calculated chance on human resources and the energy of the people concerned. This was the attitude of a government which has a true feeling for development. One was rather disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition, who uses so often the expression 'human capital' - somebody gave it to him; one would be surprised at his using it - did not appreciate the significance of the Government's actions. We on this side did appreciate the Government's actions, and we applauded them.  For the first 15 minutes of his speech last Tuesday the Leader of the Opposition was concerned with a catalogue of unhappy qualifications and modifications. He was simply whingeing about the Government's policy. He reminded me of a fast talking encyclopaedia salesman trying to sell 60 volumes to an unwilling customer. We on this side did not accept his proposition and I am sure that the Australian electorate would not accept it. The Governor-General's Speech refers to Australia's economic growth but above all to the problems which we face in terms of our strategic position. One or two minutes should be spent on this aspect, because it is important. In this country as well as in Europe, and certainly in Great Britain, there is a fanciful view held that Australians should not complain because Britain withdrew from east of Suez because Australia has not been making a very considerable effort in terms of her own defence and strategic requirements. All honourable members have heard this argument advanced. We have had the usual references to gross national product. The figures of gross national product are used in most arguments. The argument about our effort in defence has been quite precise. It goes something like this: *We in Great Britain have been spending 6%, 7% and more of our gross national product on defence. We 'have been making an effort. You in Australia have been spending about 3%. It is true that your expenditure is increasing to 5% and higher now.' It is claimed therefore that Great Britain has placed a greater economic burden for defence on its people than Australia has placed on Australians. This argument is incorrect. It is worth analysing in a couple of ways. The real defence burden of a country is measured not only in the figures in the national accounts but also by the tables -which set out those figures. In other words, expenditure across the exchanges is probably the best single measure of a defence burden, and between 5% and 6% of Great Britain's export income is involved in defence expenditure across the exchanges. 'When we look at the forecast for Australia and the situation this year, we see that between 12% and 13% of our export income is involved in defence expenditure across the exchanges. This is a great burden for a country to carry. The remarkable thing about this country is that it is carrying this burden and at the same time maintaining its present rate of economic growth. There are very few countries in the world, except perhaps Israel, Taiwan and so on, which have this sort of burden placed upon their peoples. Australia has to make this effort because it is isolated, strategically and socially, from Europe. Europe may look to the Mediterranean, but usually it does not see beyond there. Perhaps it is true to say that beyond the Mediterranean it sees only Africa. Australia is required to make great sacrifices because she is alone. Europe is not interested in our position and the only nation to which we can look - and this is so simple and clear - is the United States of America. Those members of the Opposition who engage in constant, carping criticism of the United States and who so often echo the voice of the Europeans in making that criticism, ought to appreciate the position that they are putting themselves in. At least some of the French are clear when they say, in effect: 'Why are you in Australia concerned? We simply expect that, in the long run, your part of the world will be dominated by China'. They mean Peking. Domination may mean a Locarno pact type of arrangement, or an economic or political domination. The French accept this as the inevitable course of history, and they make their strategy accordingly. Therefore Australia finds herself in a position of isolation and we say simply that, in order to preserve this country in its present position, great sacrifices are required. Much comment has been made in this debate, in pursuance of this line of thought, about the candidature of various United States senators in the coming presidential election. How often have we heard comments concerning Senator Fulbright , for example, and how often has he been quoted in eulogy!by members of the Opposition in this place? When they quote Senator Fulbright in eulogy, why do they not quote also the fact that this senator is Eurocentric and not, of necessity, inclined towards Asia. A position that can be sustained with respect ito nations living on both sides of the Atlantic is not necessarily the pattern for nations on both sides of the Pacific wanting to build an alliance. When honourable members opposite quote one of the Kennedy brothers, with respect to the United States presidential elections, why do they not also quote his comments in 1962 and 1963 about Indonesia to appreciate what a romantic idea of Indonesia he had? Why do they not offer thanks that, at least, his forecast of what would occur in that country did not come true? Why do they not do that? These things are important to the strategic and economic theme that runs through the speech delivered by the Governor-General, to which we are replying in this debate. We have a fair view of our position when we look at the figures and appreciate that the resources of the country are to be harnessed not only for normal improvement and for the economic growth that goes with it, but also, more importantly, for our own long term strategic survival. That is the position that this Government and everyone on this side of the House supports most enthusiastically. It means that in the future great sacrifices will be required of this country. They ought not to be placed so heavily upon us, but they will be. We have to bear them, for there is no alternative. One can ask members of this House and those persons who from time to time listen to the broadcast of proceedings: Are you willing to make these sacrifices? I suggest that they are willing to do so. The results of the Senate election last year indicated that the people of this country are willing to make these sacrifices. We have no hesitation in asking them to make those sacrifices with us, so that we can say, finally, like Henry V on just such an occasion as this:","17"
"The editorial concludes:","17"
"The Navy ought to be allowed to let things settle and get on with its job.' To be sure - provided the job is done efficiently and defects are remedied, not perpetuated, in order to avoid unsettling things. The admirals and their fellows should be interested not in stifling criticism but in seeing that there is no cause for it.","4","6","17"
" I think the point is taken. If the Prime Minister, himself a former Minister for the Navy, declines any blame when he was responsible for the Navy for 5 years, surely it is reasonable to claim that the honourable member for Higinbotham (Mr Chipp), who was Minister for the Navy immediately before the present Minister and who was dismissed by the Prime Minister, is also in no way responsible for the 'Voyager' disaster. So, in looking for a reason for the dismissal of the honourable member for Higinbotham from the Ministry, we have to look further than the 'Voyager' disaster.","17"
"I have finished with my remarks on the 'Voyager' disaster. Two Ministers of the previous Ministry were dismissed; one was the honourable member for Higinbotham, who was Minister for the Navy, and the other the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Howson), who was Minister for Air, and whose dismissal could have been due to the fact that he was badly burned over the use of VIP aircraft. It is a sorry state of affairs that a Minister who was doing his best to protect some of his senior ..ministerial colleagues should get the blame for the criticism that was directed at the Government over the use of VIP aircraft. But I do not think that was the reason for his dismissal. We have to look for another reason; so we look to see what these two former Ministers, who were dismissed from the Ministry, have in common. They have two things in common. Both of them are young men, somewhat inexperienced in the Ministry, and both are reputed to have been active supporters of the Minister for Immigration (Mr Snedden) in the Prime Ministership dogfight. They can be regarded as casualties of war. They were dismissed from their portfolios because they backed the wrong horse in the Prime Ministership race. I am reasonably certain that they have been treated more harshly than the Vietcong girl who was tortured recently. They would much sooner have been given the water treatment and allowed to retain their portfolios than be dismissed from the Ministry. I mention this subject because I think it shows that their dismissal was vindictive and narrow-minded. If the reason that I advance for their dismissal is anywhere near the truth I pose to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the Prime Minister the question: Why is it that the Minister for Immigration, the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Hasluck) and the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Bury) were retained in the Ministry?  It was clearly stated by the Prime Minister when he was first appointed that he intended to mark off the page and start anew. He gave the impression that he would create new portfolios in the Ministry and put new members in it. Various alterations in the Ministry were anticipated by political commentators of all shades of opinion, but only three new Ministers appeared, one to lake the place of a Minister who was retiring and the other two to take the place of the dismissed Ministers. Who were the two new Ministers who replaced the dismissed Ministers? They were the greatest rebel in the Senate, Senator Reg inald Wright, and the greatest rebel in the House of Representatives, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) . As backbench members, both used to howl and perform at regular intervals. The honourable member for Mackellar, now Minister for Social Services, has been as quiet and as innocuous as a lamb since his appointment to his portfolio. We have not heard a bleat from him. His ideas on the aboltion of the means test, and increases in rates of pension and other improvements in social services, already have been broken down. However, one thing has been learned from the appointment of the honourable member for Mackellar and Senator Reg Wright and that is that the formula to foe followed if a person wants to achieve ministerial rank in Liberal circles is to become a rebel. Selfishness and disloyalty are two of the qualifications desired. The lessons of the success of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) and Senator Wright have certainly not gone unheeded in Liberal ranks. I have already encountered a cave of now dissident, but previously loyal, members of the Liberal Party, having seen them in secret conclave a few nights ago. The new motto of the Party is: 'Up the rebels, down with loyalty'. For the past few elections one votewinning source - a great vote winner for Liberals - has been criticism of the Labor Party structure, including our Federal Executive and Federal Conference, and accusations that Labor parliamentarians are under instruction from an outside body. Whatever may have been said in this regard, nobody has at any time been able to suggest that the leader of any other political party has instructed the Labor Party as to who is fit or unfit to be our leader. On the contrary, however, one pronouncement from the Leader of the Country Party was sufficient to send every Liberal member scurrying to his burrow. It was also sufficient to make the most ambitious man in this Parliament forgo an opportunity to achieve his burning ambition to become Prime Minister of Australia. The Liberal Party showed the world that it was not master of its own destiny by being-, frightened into submission by the threatsof the ageing Country Party leader. The selection of Senator John Grey Gorton as Leader of the Liberal Party marked a. great day in the history of the Country Party. It showed who was master in the Government of this country. To my mind, the Liberal Party has not come out of the election of the new Prime Minister in a good light at all. Let me now quote this, passage from the Governor-General'sSpeech:","17"
"The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) more or less confined his remarks to an issue about which he believes he has some special knowledge. I do not deny the accuracy of the honourable member's claim. He made some very constructive criticisms of the inadequacy of the rate of development of the north of Australia. He referred to the drift of population from country areas to the cities. The Opposition agrees with him. We cannot continue to support a policy which encourages this.  The Opposition recognises the problem and we have sought in this House on a number of occasions to encourage a policy of decentralisation. May I direct the honourable member's attention to the notice paper for today where he will see that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Beaton) has given notice of a motion which deals with decentralisation. When this motion comes up for discussion in the House we hope that it will receive the support of members of the Country Party. The honourable member then referred to social services. Again he was most critical of the Government's attitude. The Opposition has consistently pointed to the problems of pensioners in Australia. Surely the honourable member was in a position to point out to the Government tha t tha Governor-General's Speech should have contained some indication of the Government's intentions. In particular, he could have emphasised its responsibility to grant immediate increases to those in receipt of social service or repatriation pension.* of one kind or another. Instead, the Government prefers to wait until the next Budget is presented to deal with the inadequate pensions tha t are now being paid. Before being elected to this Home the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) stated that he intended to devote his attention particularly to the question of social services. He has appointed a new Minister for Social Services. No-one on this side of the House would fail to recognise that the new Minister is a man of some energy and, we believe, of some talent. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to support the point of view that was expressed by the Prime Minister before he came to this House - it has since been expressed by the Minister himself - that there is a need to improve payments now being made to the various classes of social service pensioners. So far there has been no indication of any action of this kind. I remind honourable members that when the 1966-67 Budget was presented we were told that an increase in pensions was not possible. When the 1967-68 Budget was presented we were again told that an increase was not possible because the money was required for defence purposes. We have never accepted that proposition. We have never believed that a small section of the community should be asked to accept sole responsibility for the Government's defence spending. No other interpretation can be placed upon the Government's attitude. Now the Government has acknowledged the plight of pensioners. We have just heard the honourable member for Kennedy say that he thought their position was serious. He referred particularly to the pensioners with whom he is more closely associated, namely, those who live in the country. We can appreciate their special problems, but pensioners everywhere in Australia have special problems. If they have no other income, if they have no other assets, if they are completely dependent upon the amount paid to them by this Government under the social services legislation, obviously they are in difficulties. The Government should have taken the opportunity early in 1968 to make an immediate grant to those whom it has already acknowledged represent a large section of the Australian community which is suffering financial hardship. What the Government proposes to do at the time of the Budget of course will be determined by the Minister for Social Services and the Government between now and the time when the Budget is presented, but the Government might have taken the opportunity - indeed it should have taken the opportunity - to make reference to this problem and to indicate to this Parliament and the people of this country that it was not prepared to wait until the Budget session but would grant an immediate increase in pensions. What the honourable member for Kennedy says in effect is correct. He believes that pensioners are in financial difficulties. But he might have said, as I have already indicated, that the Government could have moved to provide a measure of generosity for these people at this time. Having said that, I add that the Governor-General's Speech, in the opinion of honourable members on this side of the House, can be regarded as having presented probably the most sterile programme ever presented to an Australian parliament. The Speech confirms the suspicion, aroused by the token changes made by the Prime Minister in the structure of the Ministry, that the new Government will be very much a business as usual government in the style of its undistinguished predecessors. The Prime Minister quite clearly has not been able to convert the energy and dynamism that he brought to his election into valid policy initiatives. There must be grave reservations about his ability to assert himself as an innovator of policy. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) on Tuesday night detailed a series of serious ommissions from the Governor-General's Speech. He referred to the failure to legislate for grants for school libraries and pre-school training facilities. These were intimated by the late Prime Minister in his policy speech at the opening of last year's Senate election campaign. Significantly, the late Prime Minister said that the Minister for Education and Science at that time - the present Prime Minister - was examining the proposals to extend Commonwealth aid school libraries and pre-school training centres. This commendable extension of the principle of the science laboratories grants legislation appears to have been scrapped by the Prime Minister since his elevation from his former portfolio. The Leader of the Opposition also referred to Mr Holt's proposals for dealing with the problem of the chronically ill. The Prime Minister has done nothing to convert Mr Holt's concern for these unfortunate people into meaningful legislation. The right h onourable gentleman has ignored the opportunity to cure the 'underlying malaise' in the PostOffice largely induced by outmoded arbitration systems applying to workers in government instrumentalities, Nor has he said anything to allay the grave fears aroused by repeated attacks on the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and on wage fixing procedures by the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Bury). The whole system of wage fixing and administering income policy in Australia is in a ferment, and all Australian wage earners are looking to the Government to clarify an immensely complex situation. The only response of the Government has been to assail the Arbitration Commission which has only done its duty according to its precedents and procedures and the industrial submissions presented to it.","17"

"I would think that apart from anything else that cancellation at that late stage, cancellation charges involved, would all, again leaving aside the question of whether one should or whether one shouldn't, add up to the suggestion it is too late anyway.","4","6","17"

"Just what kind of contract do you have with Australia? Are they going to buy planes willy nilly? If your figures are off $2 million and the cost is S7i million apiece are they going to buy them for $10 million? Have they no top limitation, or did they simply say 'We will take two dozen planes at whatever price they are'?","17"
"That is the way the agreement reads. It is a Government to Government agreement and I do not know how you would enforce such an agreement other than by the goodwill and the comity of the two countries involved, but that is the agreement.","17","20"
"Apparently Mr Gilpatric was as staggered by this incredible arrangement as the members of the investigating committee. In other words, Australia made an open-ended commitment to purchase these planes willy nilly, without a top limitation at whatever price was decided and by a Government to Government agreement based on goodwill. Mr Gilpatric 's understanding was that the agreement could be enforced only by goodwill, and successive Australian Governments have certainly manifested immense goodwill over the purchase. This is the way the purchase of the most notable item of defence equipment in Australia's history was negotiated in 1963 by the then Minister for Defence. It is no wonder that the Prime Minister wants to dissociate himself from this dubious arrangement. This is the sort of defence planning which has placed the economy under such severe strain today.  Neither the Parliament nor the Australian people have been given even the slightest hint of the Government's future defence plans in the light of the British withdrawal from South East Asia or of the magnitude of future defence commitments and future defence spending. There has been a blatant disregard of accepted planning principles in the defence build-up of recent years. I do not want to refer in any detail to the Governor-General's comment on the Vietnam war. There will be a debate on this subject in this chamber next week. It has become increasingly apparent that the Government's all-the-way commitment has been completely discredited. I do not blame this on the Prime Minister, as I think he has a genuine desire to moderate the extremity of the Government's stand, but there seems to be little he can do. There has been a remarkable growth of dissent from conventional policies in the United States in recent weeks. Inevitably this will make its impact in Australia where there has been an unquestioning acceptance by most Australian people of the Government's policies. The Government can no longer rely on a complacent attitude in the electorate. Quite clearly it is now impossible for a military solution to be forced in Vietnam, and inevitably the Government must come to the Opposition's stance that there must be a negotiated settlement to the war. As the Labor Party's policy stresses, this must be approached initially by an end to the bombing of North Vietnam, recognition of the National Liberation Front as a principal party to negotiations and the scaling down of the scope of the war so that negotiations can begin. The Government's attitude on this has been blindly to follow whatever suggestions have been made from sources outside this country. It has never at any stage endeavoured to follow a policy which would bring an end to the war by a negotiated peace. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the Governor-General's Speech, again discussing a matter of grave importance to this country, made no reference to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. There is still no indication of the Government's attitude towards the treaty. The Prime Minister in response to questions has revealed extreme sensitivity on this issue in the light of the statements he made when he was a backbencher and a junior Minister in another place. I urge the Prime Minister to clarify at the earliest opportunity the chaos that exists in the current economic thinking of the Government.","17"

"I know there is but I am speaking about the Chowilla Dam which is in the honourable member's electorate. I am not finding fault with the honourable member for Angas. Now that the Minister has made this statement, I think that we must wait for a full investigation. The honourable member for Angas knows that from the time that it was first mooted that the Chowilla Dam would be built, certain people in Mildura and in New South Wales have been pointing out in articles in the Sunraysia Daily' newspaper and by other means that the scheme should not be proceeded with as it would only cause greater salinity in the area. Furthermore, the honourable member for Angas has said that the contract price has gone up. Of course it has gone up dramatically. If my memory serves me correctly, the Federal Government undertook to provide the State of New South Wales with the amount for which it would be indebted because of the scheme. It agreed to let New South Wales have a loan of that amount over a long term. So the question that has to be considered is: For how much is the Federal Government committed? It is committed for its own share and for the New South Wales share. Generaly speaking, the financial position will be very serious.  Finally let me say that I have made various statements on this matter tonight. I heard the honourable member forAngas speak and appreciated what he said. But I say that we have to wait and seewhat happens as a result of the investigations that are being made by consultants, engineers and the Federal Government on the question of salinity. 1 hope that the Minister for National Development will be able to give us further news of what is to take place and what the investigations have revealed as soon as possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.1 p.m.","17"
