"Motion (by Mr. Higgs) agreed to.","17"
"Debate resumed from 3rd July (vide page 10460), on motion by Mr. Watt.","17"
"Upon which Mr. Higgs had moved, by way of amendment:","17"
"That all the words after ' That' be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words 'the Government does not possess the confidence of this House.'","17"
"When the debate was adjourned last evening, I was pointing out that the Ministerial statement presented by the Acting Prime Minister did not contain even a hint that the Government proposed to take any steps to deal with the Trusts and Combines which are operating in the Commonwealth, and which were so roundly condemned last evening by several Ministerial supporters. There can be no doubt that Trusts and Combines have Australia in their grip. The Beef Trust is operating strongly in the Commonwealth to-day. In a report presented by a Commission appointed by the United States Government to inquire into the Chicago Meat Trust and its ramifications, quotations from which appeared in the Barrier Daily Truth of 5th April last, there is given a list of the operations of the Beef Trust in various countries. According to the report of the Commission, Armour and Company, of the Meat Trust, are represented in Australia and New Zealand by Armour and Company, of Australasia, and Swift Company, also members of the Trust, are represented in Australia by the Australian Meat Export Company. The Commission reported that:","17"
"The Commission had to meet deliberate falsification of returns properly required under legal authority; we had to meet schools for witnesses, where employees were coached in anticipation of their being called to testify in an investigation ordered by you (President Wilson) and by the Congress of the United States; we had to meet a situation created by the destruction of letters and documents vital to this investigation; we had to meet a conspiracy in the preparation of answers to the lawful inquiries of the Commission. The public were told that no ' Trust ' existed, and that the ' Big Five ' were in most effective competition, but the report declares that ' these five corporations and their 500 odd subsidiary, controlled, and affiliated companies, are bound together by joint ownership, agreements, understandings, communities of interest, and family relationships.' In the three years 1915-1916-1917 four of the five big concerns made net profits amounting to £35,600,000, and it is stated that in 1917 their earnings were more than four times as much as in the year before the war.","12"
"The Commission went on to say -","12"
"It is our opinion that the failure of American meat production to keep pace with population is in large measure due to the conditions created and maintained in the markets by the Big Five.","12"
"This may well be the reason for the high cost of meat and other commodities in Australia. It has been denied from time to time that the Meat Trust is' operating in Australia. Here we have a Commission declaring, on unimpeachable testimony, that it is operating not only in America and other countries, but in Australia. Despite the fact that this evidence is in .the hands of the Government, that all this information is available to them, they show no disposition to take any action in regard to the Trust. At this critical period in our history, when we are facing a readjustment of industry and thousands of workless people do not know where they are to obtain the next meal, the Government are still unprepared to do anything. The Ministerial statement deals with a number of comparatively immaterial matters, but there is not even a hint in it that the Government intend to do anything to alleviate the necessities of the people or to deal with Trusts and Combines. I do not wish to weary honorable mem- . bars by making long quotations, but I desire to place before them -an extract from an article entitled ' The Simple Annals of the Poor,' which appeared in the Age of 20th June last. This statement is made, not by a Bolshevik or a red-ragger, but by a newspaper in an article dealing with the work of the Ministering Children's League. Referring to a meeting held by that League .in the Town Hall, the Age states that -","12"
"It was a pathetic picture of the lives of the little children of parents who were 'inefficient - not very .good at anything,' and whose helpless inefficiency was assumed to be largely due to stunted or ill-nurtured physiques. The fathers have very poor earning capacity, and they are the first to be dismissed when work slackens. Therefore their little ones know too much about want. One child, just returned from the Cottage by the Sea at Queenscliff, met her mother with the cry, 'Mother, there was food left over after every meal! As Sister Emilie, of the Central Methodist Mission, said, that one sentence revealed a terrible condition of affairs in that child's home.","12","17"
"It is only too true that this state of affairs relates not to the home of one child only, but is characteristic of thousands of homes in Australia to-day. The honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Mcwilliams) said last evening that several hundred soldiers had been prevented from returning to their homes in Tasmania because of the action of Mr. Walsh, general secretary of the Seamen's Union, in calling out the crew of the Wyandra. That statement illustrates the colossal hypocrisy of the Government, who are trying to persuade the people that the seamen are the cause of the present trouble. As a matter of fact, the Government are deliberately holding up the coal supply and trying to utilize the Seamen's Union, just as they availed themselves of the Eveleigh Workshops dispute in 1917, to starve the women and children of this country, and to blame the workers for the trouble, in order to break down our industrial organization. They wish to remove the political representatives of the working classes here. The country is being run at the present time by a gang of murdering thieves. It is a conspiracy-","12"
"I do not care. Women and children are starving.","17"
"With your concurrence, Mr. Speaker, may I interpose. I regret that I was absent when the incident to which my attention has been directed took place. I am entirely ignorant of its nature except that I am given to understand by my honorable colleague (Mr. Groom) that interjections have been made in defiance of the order of the Chair. That is not uncommon when feeling runs high. But it is also a very common incident that when honorable members have had time to reflect, they see the wisdom of obeying the Chair, no matter on what side of the House they sit. I take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to supplement your appeal to the honorable member that he will obey the ruling of the Chair, as all honorable members from the Leader of the House downwards have to do.","17"
"May I offer a few additional words. I am not permitted, nor is any honorable member, to discuss the merits of the views of the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) as expressed in 'his interjection. If I were I would tell 'him that the Government has done and is prepared to do a great deal, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) himself knows. That, however, is not the question before the House.","17"
"That the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) be suspended from the service of the House.","12"
"I take this action very reluctantly, because I am sure the honorable member and his colleagues feel that this incident is unfortunate, and should not be pursued. However, no alternative is left to me, and I move accordingly.","12"
"Order! I suspend the sitting of the House for fifteen minutes. {Sitting suspended from 11.25 to 11.40 a.m.)","12","17"
"May I be permitted, with the consent of the House, to add just a few words to the appeal which you, sir, have made. The honorable member for Barrier knows perfectly well that the laws relating to the preservation of order are imperative in a deliberative assembly of this character. I will therefore say - although it may possibly be regarded by you as irrelevant - that,; as far as the Government is concerned in its relation to the present distress, it has responded to every appeal which has been made to it.","17"
"That the honorable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine) be suspended from the service of the House.","12"
"I know at all events that you 'ratted' from the Labour party.","17"
"That is not the question; and that is not what the honorable member said. I am dealing with his statement concerning the demobilization arrangements.","17"
"I am not aware that any were sent away without leave.","17"
"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred also to Mr. Keith Murdoch and the Sun newspaper. I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Murdoch on several occasions, and I can speak of him as an excellent type of Australian, holding Australia's end up very creditably in London. But having said that, I want now to say that good as were Mr. Murdoch 's opportunities for obtaining information, it was not always possible for him to go to the best source, and that, after all, his periodical letters to certain newspapers in this country were but the expressions of opinion of Mr. Murdoch , and of nobody else. We all know that in Australia we have different view-points on matters of immediate importance, and in just the same way it may be assumed that Mr. Keith Murdoch's view-points differ from those of other well informed people in the Old Country. It is rather unfortunate that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the Sun , because I find the following from Mr. Murdoch in that journal on 25th February, 1919:","17"
"The shipyard strikes are delaying 6,000 Australians in England, and causing keen disappointment amongst the troops. General Monash has ascertained the views of the men awaiting passages, who include a large proportion of unionists, with the result that artisans have freely volunteered to fit the ships. These men were immediately engaged on two vessels, sent to the southern ports from London. They receive union wages, besides their military allowance, and are working vigorously.","17"
"Why was it that the speeding up of our soldiers happened only after Mr. Keith Murdoch's expose?","17"
"I stated that I knew positively of the Euripides. That happened to be because I had been placed on the boat roll to sail on the vessel. I might add that it was owing to influenza that I was unable to travel upon her.","17"
"Not the whole of the credit.","17"
"I am merely suggesting that there may have been a reason why the offer was rejected, if it was rejected at all. Now I am advised there has been an official denial. Honorable members may not be aware that originally it was proposed by the Imperial Government that all oversea troops should be returned to their home countries direct from France, and, acting on that assumption, the Canadian, the South African, the New Zealand, and the United States Governments got to work and made their plans for demobilization. However, there was a change in the programme, and the change was notified only after the armistice had been signed. I ask honorable members generally to bear in mind what this one change alone would mean in the way of organization. Large bodies of men cannot be moved unless careful arrangements are made for the movement, and for proper feeding, housing, and so forth. By way of illustration, I may say that in the Old Country it was not possible to get the necessary camp accommodation for our Australian soldiers without much delay and much cross-firing between the Home authorities and the representatives of Australia. Ultimately, the difficulties were overcome, and we were able to get additional camps. I do not think that honorable members opposite would desire Australian soldiers to be quartered in tents on Salisbury Plain in winter time.","17"
"I do not know, but I read about it in an Adelaide paper on my arrival at Fremantle.","17"
"I do not say that the honorable member's statement is incorrect, but I would like to know the date in order that we might clear up any misunderstanding. The Director-General of Demobilization, with whom I was associated for nearly four months, is as sympathetic towards the 'digger' as is any honorable member opposite.","17"
"In the Australian Imperial Force, it was very often a distinct disadvantage to be a member of Parliament.","17"
"It was decidedly. I had proof of it on many an occasion.","17"
"It is more than testimony; it is proof. The honorable member for Kennedy asked in a rather sneering way if I knew anything about the French end of demobilization? The Imperial Head-quarters, which controlled the Australian Imperial Force, were in London, and an organization which is controlled by another must of necessity have its central administration at the point where the other is operating. That was the reason for the establishment of our central administration for demobilization in London. Any person who was aware of the great trouble occasioned by the delays to mails, and the unsatisfactory method of making use of telegrams between France and England, can realize how difficult it was to carry on dealings between the two places, and how necessary it was to have the demobilization head-quarters in London.","17"
"Hear, hear!","12"
"Horseferry-road was known as the 'flappers' rest,' was it not?","17"
"It may have been, but I have never heard that title used in connexion with it. The individuals who were responsible for the work at Horseferry-road were, on the whole, hardworking, conscientious men who used every endeavour to hold the scales of justice evenly in accordance with the instructions they received from time to time. But the work at Horseferry-road could have been speeded up. I was asked to take up a certain branch of demobilization, and entered on the duties attaching to it on the 9th December last. I was given an office, a table, and a telephone; writing material eventually came along; and I was bold, 'The Australian Imperial Force is there; select the staff you need to carry on this work, and go ahead.' Not knowing the Australian Imperial Force very intimately, I sought the advice of officers who did, and secured the names of a number of men who were considered suitable for the class of work I had on hand. Then I applied through the departmental channel of Horseferry-road to have these men sent across from France to London for the purpose of an interview; because the work I was doing was performed wholly by men who volunteered to remain in Great Britain and see it through. I emphasize my use of the word 'volunteered;' it has a bearing on something which I wish to say later on. It took me exactly six weeks to get one senior officer from France to London through the Horseferry-road administration. It took me ten days to get another officer through the Demobilization Administration. It was not excessive for an officer to spend ten days in reaching London owing to the transportation delays that ensued upon the signing of the armistice, but a delay of six weeks was outrageous. That is my experience from an interdepartmental point of view. Now, in reference to the voluntary work of members of the Australian Imperial Force in London, Senator Pearce has been accused of having taken twenty-seven pay clerks from Australia to the Old Country. It was in January last that Senator Pearce left for London with these officers, but at that time one had the greatest difficulty in the world to get members of the Australian Imperial Force to volunteer their services for any work in London. When news came to Australia from Great Britain that clerks were scarce and worth their weight in gold, and that the necessary work had to be done by employing English people in the Australian offices, the Defence Department decided to send these twenty-seven pay clerks from Australia to London, where they were required. There was no desire on the part of the Administration to force a member of the Australian Imperial Force to leave France against his will and go to London, and thus be blocked from returning to Australia.","17"
"Those clerks were only despatched after the chance of doing the work had been offered to practically every man serving over there.","17"
"I went down to the Chamber of Manufactures, and pointed out how they made £6,000,000 more profit within the last four years than they had made previously, according to their own figures. They did not feel very much obliged to me for telling them that.","17"
"I should be only too glad to have the assistance of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter, because I feel that it is one of the ways in which we can solve the problems that are confronting us. I say to him in all sincerity that if we can get organized labour on the one hand and capital on the other, to meet together for some common object, as they are meeting in the particular instance I have quoted, we shall remove quite a number of the existing difficulties and disadvantages. The objects of the alliance, briefly stated, are as follow: 1. To promote active co-operation of employers and employed in the treatment of questions generally affecting labour and employment in all trades and industrial occupations. 2. To promote the welfare of the industrial workers of the country, and efficiency of its industries. 3. To promote arrangements for facilitating the reinstatement in civil employment at the end of the war of men serving with the Forces, and also munition workers. This organization was only formed in 1916. It was bred out of war-time conditions, and with a knowledge of what the war might eventually mean. In the report for 1916-18, the following excerpt is quoted from one of the 'Whitley reports-","17"
"To use a phrase which the honorable member will understand, they have 'got the wind up.' Is not that the reason?","17"
"I went into the matter very closely, because I am sure the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. West) will take my assurance that I would not deal with the thing in a halfhearted way. I wanted to know the facts. They were good enough to furnish me with their audited balance-sheets, and I say distinctly that you have to get something more than a surface view to find out where the difficulty is. I do not profess to know how we are going to get at it. The honorable member for Cook (Mr. J. H. Catts), for instance, had a good deal to do at, one stage with price fixing. Owing to his work at that time, I believe the honorable member is a wiser man now than he was before he started, and so are a good many more of us, who have found out that it is not so easy to fix prices as it looks. If the States will exercise their functions, and check anything which appears on the surface to be an absolute profiteering 'ramp' that, I think, will be a sufficient check against that phase of it. But it does not go as deeply as I should like to see the inquiry go. I would like the Commonwealth, even with the crippled powers that it possesses, to make some effort to assist the States. In the district which I have the honour to represent we import a lot of goods from the eastern part of Australia. A Price Fixing Board has no more chance of controlling the prices of those goods than I have of receiving £1,000,000 tomorrow.","17"
"The honorable member who has just resumed his seat has made one or two valuable contributions to this debate, and, from my stand-point, one of the most valuable was his admission that the demobilization of our troops on the other side of the world had been in capable hands from its very inception. In saying that he proved that the presence of Senator Pearce in England was totally unnecessary.","17"
"Not altogether different. At any rate, there is to be opposition. If labour is likely to get a bigger bite out of results in the United Kingdom, pronounced efforts will be made to prevent it. The honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Burchell). is altogether too optimistic when he relies upon those reports to bring about the conditions which he described. I ask the House to realize that Australia to-day is the one part of the world which can, if she chooses, be self-contained. Within our own bounds we can produce everything that is necessary to sustain human life. Consequently we have very little cause indeed to depend upon any assistance from the outside world. If we will only take the trouble to conserve, by means of storage, our surplus from the good years, we shall always have ample reserves to enable us to face seasons of drought with complacency.","17"
"Yes; and he continues to do so. These are stern facts that we have to face. I would not shrink from adopting any means - even the smashing of the Mace, or the tipping of Mr. Speaker out of his chair - if that would bring food to the hungry. I would be prepared to take my share of the risk incurred in any such action. I am sure that the honorable member for Darwin (Mr. Spence) well remembers the dire distress which followed the collapse of the land boom and the great industrial troubles that occurred in the early nineties. We all know the persecution and the starvation which ensued. We have the iron in our souls to this day, as the result of the treatment which was then meted out to innocent people. God forbid that there should be any repetition of those times in Australia. Yet for more than twelve months I have been urging that the same spirit that existed in. the early nineties exists to-day. There is a tendency on the part of employers, assisted by capitalistic Governments, to squelch trade unionism in this country. No effort is being made to bring about a better understanding between employers and employees. There is no endeavour made to rescue the people from the talons of the profiteer and to provide employment for the people. I feel almost the blush of shame rise to my cheeks when I read on the political programme of the National Federation the plank, 'Unemployment insurance.' What an awful indictment that is against an intelligent and up-to-date people. Ought there to be any unemployment in Australia? To that question every voice in this House will reply, 'No.' I am not surprised at the present industrial unrest in this country. Knowing, as I do, the spirit of the men and women of the working classes, the wonder to me is that there is not still greater unrest. We, here, talk about this thing and that thing. Yet we do nothing. Parliament has become merely a talking shop. When we stress the industrial unrest caused by the excessive cost of living, some honorable members whine, 'Why, we have tried to induce the people on two occasions to give this Parliament larger powers, but they have turned down our proposals.' But it has always been the policy of the Labour party to try and try again. When the people were first asked to give this Parliament greater powers under our Constitution, by an overwhelming majority they declined to do so. This may have been due to the fact that the questions submitted to them were of a somewhat intricate character. At the following elections the Labour party said, 'We are going to test the opinion of the people again in regard to these matters.' We were then assured by our political opponents, as the honorable member for Fremantle knows, that the Labour party was acting in an extremely foolish way by endeavouring to obtain at an election time an amendment of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the questions were submitted to the people, and some of those questions were within an ace of being carried. With that latest vote on record, why have we waited all these years without asking the electors once more to endow this National Parliament with the powers which we need?","17"
"Yes; and they ought to have been submitted to the people. But we all know that it was represented to the Prime Minister that if he would set aside those measures, the State Premiers would take certain action in the direction of voluntarily handing over to this Parliament more powers than it at present possesses. We were impressed by that offer, and we were urged at that particular time to drop the Bills in question. But it was never intended that they should be dropped indefinitely if the promise which was made by the State Premiers was not respected. As soon as it became evident that the State Parliaments did not intend to sanction the proposition of the Prime Minister, I made it my business to wait upon Mr. Hughes. I said to him: 'You see how things are going'; to which he replied, 'Yes; it is very unfortunate.' I then said, ' The sooner we submit these proposals to the people the better.'","17"
"The difficulty to which the honorable member refers is only of a temporary character, and I am referring to a permanent condition of affairs, which was in existence prior to the disturbance to which he alludes. There are committees engaged in my constituency nearly all the year round collecting contributions in money and clothing to make provision for those who cannot provide for themselves. Yet we boast that this is a free and well cared-for community. Is it any wonder that there should be discontent in this country? What did the Prime Minister say only the other day? In a few words, the right honorable gentleman put - as he can do very graphically and dramatically - the natural consequence of the discontent to be found in the world today. When addressing a company of workers Mr. Hughes said, 'The profiteer breeds Bolshevism.' Honorable members opposite know as well as I do that that is the truth. Yet we sit down quietly and allow the profiteer to go on his way and, do not lift a little finger to rescue those whom he has in his talons. We cannot wonder, in the circumstances that there are displays of discontent, not only in this House, but outside. The workers went away in their numbers to fight against the common enemy, and if there is one thing on which they have made up their minds it is that those dependent upon them, and all living under similar conditions, are going to have more of the good things of this life than they have had in the past. No matter what Government may be in power, they will be ignominiously pitched out of office by the people of this country if they do not satisfy that demand, which is becoming more and more clamorous every day. Go where we will we find that the voices of the small business man, the artisan, and the ordinary labourer are joined in the one complaint, 'We are being fleeced and robbed.' Yet, with that united voice of the people in our ears, legislators loll on the benches here and do not lift a finger to redress the grievances of the people. I intend to give expression to my opinion so long as Mr. Speaker is here to listen to me. As a representative of the people I have the right to make my voice heard in this chamber, and I intend to do so as frequently and as vigorously as I can in order that some relief may be afforded to the people who are suffering. I ask how honorable members think we would have got through the war if the workers had stood aside. We know very well that it is impossible to carry on any industry without the assistance of organized labour. I shall quote an extract presently to show what has been said elsewhere regarding the necessity of ranging organized labour on the side of those who hope to do anything for the country. It may be said that no voice was raised by the workers of the country in support of the demand for proper organization to meet the conditions with which we would be faced on the return of our men from the Front. In this connexion I shall quote what was said at a deputation to the then Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) when the Prime Minister was absent on his first visit to the Old Country. The deputation represented the Trades Hall Council of Melbourne, and there was present on it also a South Australian Minister, Mr. Anstey, who happened to be in Melbourne at the time. He heard that a deputation was to wait on the Acting Prime Minister in regard to the organization of industry for the time when our men would return, in order that unemployment would not be prevalent during the reconstruction after the war. The deputation waited on the Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) on Friday, 24th March, 1916. There were present, in addition to those to whom I have referred, a number of members of this House. All the speakers laid before Senator Pearce the necessity of organizing properly for the time when the demobilization of our troops would take place. I hope I shall not be considered too egotistical if I quote what I said myself on that occasion as giving expression to my thoughts at the time. I said -","17"
"That is the opinion of the London Times, and I believe it is the opinion of Mr. Lloyd George. I believe that his efforts have been very largely in that direction. In the reconstruction period he is desirous of having behind him the whole body of organized labour. The Government in Great Britain are doing their best not to antagonize organized labour, but to show themselves as friendly disposed to labour as possible. They realize, as do many writers of distinction in the Old Country, that without the assistance of organized labour, reconstruction after the war must be a terrible failure. That course is not being followed in Australia. The workers of this country have recently been called by the most opprobrious names. We are called to order sometimes for what is said on this side, but I remember distinctly that only quite recently a certain honorable member on the other side, pointing to the Ministerial benches beneath him, said, 'We are the builders,' and, pointing over to the Opposition, 'You are the wasters.'","17"
"The honorable member is welcome to that opinion; but the remark was disorderly, in the first place, and it was also distinctly offensive and absolutely untrue. The leading men in Great Britain say to the representatives of organized labour, 'We want you, with all your force and wisdom, to come to our assistance, to range yourselves behind us, and help us in reconstruction.' Here we are called by an ex-Labour man these opprobrious names, which, if uttered outside, would possibly lead to something more than a call to order.","17"
"It is a wilful waste of money to allow these people to air their fads on the best paper, procurable. I admit that in the matter of departmental usage of paper the Postmaster-General has gone to the other extreme. The telegrams issued by his Department are so difficult to open, owing to the shocking quality of the paper, that they are a disgrace to the Department. At the other end of the scale, however, the wilful waste perpetrated by an institution which professes to do a great deal in behalf of industry amounts to a scandalous shame. The Public Accounts Committee, in a recently- submitted report, indicated to the Government where they already possess suitable sites for buildings for branches of the Public Service. Witness what Has happened recently, however. The Repatriation Department notified that it had outgrown its East Melbourne quarters - that its requirements were about 40,000 square feet of space. The Commonwealth Property Officer was requested to endeavour to secure a suitable position. He made investigations, and recommended that if the Repatriation Department required land with buildings on it, it was believed that, with the consent of the Governor-General, an area could be obtained in the neighbourhood of the Young Men's Christian Association Rest Hut. It appears that finally the Federal Government agreed to lease from the Victorian Government, for a period of twenty-one years, the site on St. Kilda-road recently occupied by Hoadley's Chocolate Factory. It is intended to pay the interest on the sum with which the State Government purchased that site - an item amounting to £400 per annum. That may be regarded by certain people as a mere bagatelle. But it is when such comparatively small amounts are heaped on each other that a huge aggregate is discovered. Why is that particular site required? There is land available in the Victoria Barracks yard which should amply serve the requirements of the Repatriation Department. There is also a large area at present carrying only some old iron buildings, at the corner of St. Kilda-road and Wadey-street, at the northern end of the Barracks block. It is occupied now by the Victorian police. It has an area of, approximately, 84,000 square feet, with a frontage of 135 feet to St. Kilda-road, 458 feet to Wadey-street. and 198 feet to Wells-street. The report of the Accounts Committee points out that if a building were to be erected on that land it would not be architecturally necessary to conform to the style of the existing Barracks, which are built of bluestone. If the Government are keen upon improving a property at all, why should they not improve their own? It appears, however, that they prefer to go further afield, and to construct temporary buildings on the Hoadley site, for which block they are to pay an item of interest amounting to £400 per annum. Further, there is the prospect at any time that they may have to quit that property and be forced to seek shelter elsewhere. One might multiply instances of public money being utterly wasted. So far as I am concerned, if any word or influence of mine can save even £10 for the public purse, I shall deem it worth my while.","17"
"Probably the honorable member and myself will be found on the same side when it comes to a vote upon that project. I am not particular as to the company I keep in a matter of that kind. No returned soldier desires to put a breadwinner out of his position, particularly if that individual has done his best to get to the Front, and has not succeeded. Yet such things are happening. I am certain that the returned men themselves would be among the first to protest. A gentleman in the city waited upon me yesterday in regard to the case of a man who, for a number of years, has been employed by a big public financial institution. My informant told me he was a fine, trustworthy, fellow. He has now received notice, however, that he is to be discharged, and that his place is to be taken by a returned soldier. The man has a wife and five children to support. He did his best to go to the Front. He enlisted, and was sent to Broadmeadows Camp, where he remained for five weeks. When a strict medical examination was made, however; he was discharged as unfit for active military service, and. he returned to his position. Now that individual must go out.","17"
"I know of the case of a man who fought in three campaigns prior to this last, and who was not accepted for the Great War; but he was 'sacked,' and a man put in his place who had never left this country.","17"
"Such things are, undoubtedly, happening. The man to whom I have referred, and who is the breadwinner for six others, is to be thrown out on a literally and metaphorically cold world. There is nothing for him to do. Such a system will not lead to proper demobilization, or to the establishment of contentment throughout the community. The fiat should go forth from the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) that in such cases there shall not be disturbance of employment. There have been bungles in regard to repatriation, some of which occurred merely because the organization of relief was not begun soon enough. President Wilson said, immediately after the armistice, 'Now, you American governmental departments, get busy! Do not wait upon private initiative. The Government must establish works to provide employment for our people.' That was the right attitude, and it was prompt. We have made no such preparations. With regard to the Tariff, honorable members opposite hold that it is right that we should wait for the return of Mr. Hughes, so that we may ascertain the proposals of the British Government. What bunkum! There are items in the Tariff concerning which we are entirely independent of Great Britain. Thousands of items are of a purely Australian character, and give employment solely to Australians. Why wait? An interim Tariff should have been introduced long ago. Certain industries to-day are dependent on the sometimes slender and brittle thread of Ministerial promises. But in some cases the thread has snapped. The promises of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) have not been kept, and, as a result, very many people have been thrown out of employment. Even the honorable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) would not embark on a big industry, entailing large expenditure, simply on a Ministerial promise. Some people did so, however, regarding the promise as emphatic; and what is required, in the light of their experience, is something in black and white in a Statute by way of protection. To their shame, there are people in Australia who, when it became known that, in consequence of the war, shipping would be short, and travelling to Europe dangerous, scuttled to Japan to arrange to bring goods manufactured in that country to Australia as quickly as possible. The quantity of such goods has increased by leaps and bounds, and I ask : What hope have we, under Australian conditions, of meeting such competition? In some articles recently published in a Melbourne newspaper we are told of thousands of boys and girls being kept in compounds in order that they may work for long hours each day in factories for a wage of 4½d. per head. The result is that there are Australians here who are buying goods created out of the blood and sweat of little Japanese children. How can Australian industries flourish under such conditions? Allied or not, we must have absolute prohibition if we are to protect Australian industries from competition of this kind. I do not know how the Free Traders propose to meet the position, but I have heard that some of them have been converted from their fiscal theories and fallacies; at any rate, they desire to make this country, so full as it is of raw material of every kind, as nearly self-contained as possible. Week by week men and women are being thrown out of employment, for the simple reason that Australia is using goods made under the conditions I have indicated. The highest wage paid to the most skilled artisan in Japan is about1s. 6d. per day, and it is only during wartime that the work people have been able to extract an extra 6d. We cannot profess to maintain the principle of a White Australia if the ports of the country are thrown open to the products of cheap labour of this kind. There would have been a certain guarantee to those who desired to start industries here if we had passed an interim Tariff. Had that been done, we could, at the close of the war, have considered our fiscal arrangements from beginning to end, and brought about an up-to-date Tariff.","17"

"On Wednesday last the honorable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) asked when the Australian Imperial Forces still in Egypt were likely to be brought home? I promised to make inquiries, and I am now able to furnish the honorable member with the following information: -","17"
"The return of the troops in Egypt was fully provided for with the general demobilization scheme, and ships were allotted, insuring that these troops arrived in Australia in the same proportion and about the same time as the troops in France and England. Owing to the serious riots in Egypt, the General Officer Commanding there suspended the demobilization arrangements, and utilized the troops for quelling the disturbances, which were of a serious nature. It was thought that this suspension would only mean a matter of a few weeks delay, but, as it appeared to be longer, the Commonwealth Government took up the matter with the Imperial Authorities, and strongly objected to the delay in demobilization, and to the Australian troops being used as part of the Army of Occupation in Egypt. As a result of these representations, conducted in England by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), the Imperial Authorities decided to relieve the Australian troops of this duty, and the shipping authorities were directed to provide ships as soon as possible for their return to Australia. As a result of this notion. eight ships were allotted for conveyance of Australian troops from Egypt, and the demobilization is now in full swing. The system adopted for demobilization of the Egypt troops is to return them to Australia by units. Prior to the suspension of demobilization, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments had left Egypt, and have since reached Australia and been demobilized. The 3rd Regiment reached Australia lost week, and the 4th Regiment is now Hearing Australia. Advices have just been received to the effect that the 5th,6th, and 7th Regiments embarked and sailed on 28th June, and the 8th Regiment and Anzac Divisional Details embarked and sailed yesterday. The total number of Light Horse Regiments in Egypt was fourteen. It is anticipated that the remaining six will embark in the ships allocated, and leave Egypt before the end of the month. It will, therefore, be seen that the return of these troops is now being accelerated and proceeding as fast as possible. Relatives of these soldiers need now have no anxiety with regard to them.","17"
"I wish to say a word or two in connexion with the Freeman case without trespassing upon the merits of the dispute between Freeman and his supporters on the one side and the Defence Department on the other. A side of the case which seems to have been lost sight of is the position of the doctor on the s.s. Sonoma. No doubt, the shipping company wished to get rid of an unwelcome visitor, but its doctor seems to have trespassed beyond the bounds of decency in getting rid of him, because I find that both morning newspapers in Sydney, in describing 'the imminent death' of Freeman, reported that the doctor on the s.s. Sonoma had said that Freeman's temperature was down to 93, and that he was on the verge of collapse. It was found, when Freeman was removed to the military hospital, that his temperature was 98.3, and I am quite sure it was the correct temperature, because I know that in the case of a perfectly healthy man a few days' starvation will do him no harm, provided he has an ample supply of water. A personal friend of mine does himself very well for six months of the year, and then has ten days' rigid fast, but during that ten days he does all his physical exercises and the other things necessary to keep him in good condition, and he looks just as well at the end of that period as he did at the beginning of it.","17"
"That may be so, and he is probably laughing heartily now, and may laugh heartily when he reads my remarks. But it is a very dangerous laugh that would cause the feeling there was in Sydney at that time. There was a great deal of public sympathy for a man who 'was starving and on the verge of collapse' which Freeman could not have been if he was taking water. That fact seems to be well established. The doctor of the vessel seems to have done his best to cheat public sympathy, and I would like the Acting Attorney-General to see whether his behaviour brings him within the compass of the laws of the Commonwealth. Question resolved in the affirmative.","17"
