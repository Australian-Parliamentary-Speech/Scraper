"N/A","#NAME?"
"DQC","If the black iron washer is to be admitted free I do not see any excuse for imposing duties upon other washers. Further, there is absolutely no justification for levying a tax upon lead rivets and washers. Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN (Mel* bourne). - -perhaps it would be advisable to limit my amendment to iron and copper washers, and I ask leave to amend it accordingly. Amendment amended accordingly."
"N/A","I do not see why there should be a 10 per cent, duty upon these articles. From a protectionist's stand-point, the reason given by the Ministry for the imposition of a duty upon these articles is about the most extraordinary one that any one could listen to. The right honorable the Treasurer said that when he was preparing the Tariff he put rivets and washers on the free list because he did not know they were manufactured here; but one would have thought that a protectionist would have put a duty upon these articles so that they might be manufactured here. Now the right honorable gentleman rushes forward at the suggestion of the honorable member for Melbourne, and proposes to put a duty upon them, because he is told that they are manufactured here without the assistance of a duty. I shall vote against the proposition. The ACTING CHAIRMAN.- I ask the honorable member for Melbourne to follow the usual course, and withdraw his amendment temporarily in order to allow the amendment moved by the honorable member for South Sydney to be put."
