"5e+04","There has probably been no more effective system of adjustment in the world than that introduced through the rural reconstruction scheme in Australia by the Liberal-Country Party Government in the early 1970s. The scheme has provided a diversity intended to meet the particular requirements of individual industries. Significantly, it is there not only to help those farmers who are- as the honourable gentleman's question suggests- poor or disadvantaged but also to help re-adjustment. The House would know that there are three principal components of the scheme. There is a debt adjustment component which is to enable farmers who are financially disadvantaged, either by markets or seasons, to fund their operations until such stage as those two factors are corrected. The second part is a farm build-up component which enables farmers whose size of holding is too small to have access to funds at slightly better than commercial interest rates to enable them to operate on a more commercially viable basis. The third component is a form of assistance to help farmers out of the industry. Debt adjustment funds are available at interest rates which represent a significant concession. Farm build-up funds also are provided below commercial rates of interest. The whole concept is that money is provided by the Commonwealth separately to each of the States and individual States have their own reconstruction authorities which in their operations make determinations as to eligibility. The system is co-ordinated through regular meetings between Commonwealth and State Ministers to determine the basis of funding for the future having regard to the method of past operation. I believe that the scheme has worked most effectively. Of course a time of rural recovery does not mean that there are not still pockets of disability in the rural sector. The Commonwealth recognises this and continues to maintain funding for the scheme for that reason.","12","17"
"QS4","I have seen such reports, as I indicated yesterday. If I may broaden the answer that I gave yesterday, the Government has no intention of introducing any such taxes. Indeed, as the honourable gentleman would know, we have provided very great relief for small businessmen, small farmers, householders and many people in many different parts of the country by relieving them of the burden of death duties. It is worth noting that most States—even Labor States—are tending to follow that example because they recognise the inequity of that kind of tax. It is possible that there is a different view and a different philosophy in the Australian Labor Party in Canberra. The honourable member for Gellibrand in the Laurie Oakes Report of 28 February—one could not possibly suggest that this was not an accurate report on this occasion stated that Labor was examining the options for the capital tax. That was confirmed by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday morning. The options Labor is examining apparently are death duties, capital gains tax or wealth tax or perhaps some combination of these—or perhaps all three. They certainly seem to be all embracing. The Government does not intend to be involved in such proposals. The people who would be affected would include pensioners, householders and small businessmen. I said this in the House yesterday and the Leader of the Opposition subsequently made a personal explanation claiming to have been misrepresented. But he did not deny that any of these groups would be affected by what he indicated. His assertions on capital gains tax might be questionable because last year following the proposal of the alternative Budget he said that if Labor had won the 1977 election it would have introduced a capital gains tax. But unfortunately Labor did not tell the people of Australia before the election that it would have introduced a capital gains tax. I do not believe that the Leader of the Opposition can deny categorically that no pensioner, no small businessman, no householder, no owner of a farm under 100 acres, would not be affected by his capital gains tax scheme. I repeat that I do not believe that the Leader of the Opposition can deny categorically that no pensioner, no small businessman, no householder or no owner of a farm under 100 acres would not be affected by his capital gains tax scheme.","17"
"9e+04","The Prime Minister will recall that last year he was asked whether he subscribed to the philosophy that all members of Parliament should disclose the assets, liabilities and tax returns of their wives and families. In reply he expressed the view that such dependants should be exempt from such disclosures. I ask whether he stills holds this view and whether he has transmitted it to the inquiry which is being conducted under Mr Justice Bowen. Is there any special reason why the Prime Minister should take this view?","12"
"QS4","I did not say that wives or children should be exempt. I was pointing out the difficulties of having a disclosure that was complete and adequate. I do not believe that the Parliament should indulge in a farce in relation to these matters and pretend to the people that it might have introduced measures which would involve adequate disclosure but which would not in fact do so. I was also pointing out the difficulties in relation to children of politicians and other matters. If disclosure is to be adequate one may well assume that all members of a family should be involved. Are children not allowed some life of their own? They cease to be dependent. Does it make much sense to say that under the age of 18 years they should be included but over the age of 18 years or 21 years they should not be included? There are very real difficulties in relation to these matters. They will no doubt be resolved or helped to be resolved when we have the Bowen report in relation to them. I have spoken very plainly to Mr Justice Bowen in relation to those matters—to the inquiry. Because the Government will need to be standing in some kind of judgment over the report, making a decision in relation to it, I did not believe that I should be speaking publicly in detail about what I put to the Commission. I therefore gave evidence in camera. The Government will be judged by its reaction to the report. We can all look at that as it comes.","17"
"JVV","It is peculiar that although this is a subject on which members of the Opposition have been so vocal in recent days they cannot even be bothered listening to the answer. The answer to the second part of the honourable member's question is that those spot prices—those wild fluctuations in Middle East prices—have no effect whatsoever on the calculation which I have just described, despite some of the drivelling to the contrary by the honourable member for Blaxland, and if the honourable member for Blaxland would just listen to the answer it might curb his drivelling. The fact is that we will calculate on 1 July a price which will reflect the price of light Arabian crude as set last December. That is a predictable price; it is a stable price. It does not reflect in any way whatsoever spot prices or prices that may be set by other OPEC countries, and I hope I make that clear without any equivocation whatsoever. If the honourable member for Blaxland wants a few more facts, this means that we will have a 5.3 per cent increase this year, and that is all. I hope that he has it clear now once and for all. The third part of the question relates to the effect on rural producers. I met the leaders of several important farm organisations and we sat and talked about this policy. I cannot say that they all agreed with the policy, but I think that there was a general consensus that they understood the practical applications and the wisdom of the move that the Government had made. It is true that some other countries whose farmers are in direct export competition with Australian farmers do subsidise farm fuel. That is recognised and there is no argument about it. However, we must look at the totality of what governments do for their farmers, and energy prices cannot be taken in isolation. One must look across the board and calculate the pluses and minuses of what the Government offers. I suppose that if one wanted to examine the totality of the farmers' position and how it was affected by energy prices, one option would be to hold an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry.","17"

The fact of the matter is that the honourable member for Newcastle and his colleagues do not like the endorsements that the OECD has given to this Government's policies and so they are trying to raise the spectre of this Government having interfered with the preparation of those reports. That totally misleading suggestion ought to be nailed immediately and rejected as an absolutely baseless attack on the integrity of the OECD 's reporting. So far as the other part of the honourable gentleman's question is concerned, let me say to him that I understand—and I will check this further after Question Time—that under the present arrangements there is scope for consultation beyond the sources of official advice coming to the Government. I have no in-principle objection to the idea of the OECD being exposed to the views of the trade union movement of Australia and, indeed, the views of spokesmen for the Opposition in these matters. But obviously there are considerations of time constraints and so forth. I will look further into that matter and let the honourable gentleman know what further can be done.","17"
"BU4","In relation to tonnage, the undertaking which the Japanese gave us previously and which they have abided by is that they will maintain the same ratio as previously—that is, approximately 48 per cent of the market—and they will continue to give approximately that percentage of the market even on the new contract basis. So we will maintain the same proportional tonnage or there will be an increased tonnage should the Japanese mills produce more steel this coming year. I think the position is pleasing when one realises that last year there was a decline in prices for some of our contracts and also some unpleasantness. This year there has been none of that. When one takes into account the more realistic iron ore prices this year, measured against an international market situation of 30 per cent over capacity, it has indeed been a very successful negotiation.

"4U4","This morning my attention was drawn to a newspaper article along the lines of the honourable gentleman's question. May I say that I am puzzled to know whether persistence of error on this point as to the civilian-service ratio stems from genuine misunderstanding or stupidity or whether it is a carefully cultivated canard. May I take this opportunity to inform the House that the facts are quite to the contrary? In 1973 the number of civilians employed within the Defence Department was of the order of 37,300. Today that number has been reduced to 30,700. I do not know of any other Government department in which there has been such a significant reduction in the number of civil servants employed within the Department. Then there is the other vision that all of those civilians at Russell Hill are—to put in homely language—pen pushers mucking up the system. This is quite false. Mr Speaker, I will not trespass upon your patience or abuse the House but I have here a table which gives a breakup of the number of civilians employed within the Department. May I take a moment to refer to it? There are more than 5,600 people employed in dockyards and overall some 10,000 are employed in naval technical supply and general supply delivering the groceries and what have you. The vision of them being pen pushers is an absurdity. There are some 6,000 civilians employed within the Army throughout the whole of Australia doing a multitude of tasks, the Air Force employs some 3,900 and approximately 4,900 are employed in the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. May I say to the honourable gentleman that the overwhelming number of those employed are under the direct responsibility of the Chiefs of Staff? At Defence central here in Canberra some 2,300 civilians are employed. I seek leave of the House and the Leader of the Opposition to have this table incorporated in Hansard.","17"

"ZJ4","My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, concerns his statement to Parliament last week in which he claimed that the money supply is under control. I ask: How does the Prime Minister justify that assertion when the money supply has increased by 11 per cent in the year to January 1979, which rate of growth is well in excess of the target rate of 6 per cent to 8 per cent? Is it not the case that, contrary to the Prime Minister's assertion, the Government is having great difficulty controlling the money supply and that it has already abandoned the target rate of growth for this year?","17"
"ZD4","Mr Speaker—","12","17"
"ZD4","The speech made last week by the Prime Minister covered the whole range of the Government's economic policies in regard to the money supply. I cannot recall the precise words but they are similar to a number of speeches made on the subject recently which draw attention to the fact that one of the very successful areas of the economic policy of the present Government since it came to power three years ago has been that it has been able to get the rate of growth in the money supply in Australia under control. The honourable member's question gives me the opportunity to put into perspective statements and predictions about the rate of growth of the money supply which have been made by the Government. As the honourable member knows it has been the practice of this Government at the time of the last two or three Budgets to give an indication of the growth in the money supply which it thinks might be appropriate to activity in the economy over the period covered by the Budget. It is true, according to figures on the money supply which have been released by the Reserve Bank, that to the end of January the increase is running at an annual rate of 11 per cent. There is no argument about that. That is a simple statistical fact. The honourable member also knows that there are seasonal fluctuations in the rate of growth of the money supply. Last year people were saying that it would go well under the projection. This year people are saying that it will go well over the projection. The point that has to Be made is that the figure given at Budget time is not a firm, absolute commitment. It is likely that the money supply outcome for the current financial year will be above the upper end of the range in the Budget. But the important aspect is whether that of itself is an unfortunate occurrence and whether that of itself is inappropriate to economic conditions as they exist now. The projection is made on the basis of perceptions at Budget time. The important point is what the thrust of money supply policy is. The Government has consistently followed a money supply policy since coming to government to keep it at such a level that helps to bring down inflation whilst at the same time underwriting economic recovery. Given the developments in the economy since the time of the Budget, I would regard a money supply outcome which might happen to be above the upper end of the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range as entirely appropriate in achieving those two objectives. It is, of course, a question of magnitude. I think that it is understood that one makes a prediction at Budget time and, given developments since, that prediction ought not be seen as an absolute commitment.","17"

"CH4","It has just been drawn to my attention that last night in the adjournment debate the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Short) chose to attack me personally. The substance of his allegation was that I had used the privileges of this Parliament to attack hardworking public servants and particularly officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The facts are simply these: In an adjournment debate last week I drew to the attention of the House the decision made by the Government, due to restricted funds, to direct officers of the CES to limit their use of telegrams to people applying for jobs. I was most particular—although I had issued a Press statement previously that had been answered by a public servant who was named in his own Press statement—not to name the public servant concerned. I stated specifically that ultimately the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) had to accept responsibility for Press statements issued on behalf of his department. I made the point that in my view the statement that had been made on behalf of the Government and the Minister constituted a lie. I fail to see how the honourable member for Ballarat—if he bothered to check his facts—on the basis of the facts as they are recorded in Hansard, could accuse me of doing anything other than attacking the Government and the Minister. I certainly was not attacking a public servant.","17"
"N/A","River Murray Basin: Salinity Control—Television Services—Commonwealth Compensation—Victorian Rural Finance Commission—Australia—Unemployment—Conservation—Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Mission","17"
"CV4","Yesterday I asked a question of the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman) in relation to the salinity problem along the River Murray basin. Salinity has reached a critical level. If it is not contained it could ultimately destroy the economic viability of the river. I regret to say that the reply I received from the Minister was evasive and unsatisfactory. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Fitzpatrick) and I have persisted with this issue over the last two years. I am deeply concerned at the Government's inactivity in this area. Users of the River Murray waters are sick to death of Federal and State governments passing the buck in relation to this problem. The salinity problem is now so serious that many irrigation settlements along the Murray will be lucky to survive another decade, let alone a bad drought, unless urgent action is taken. The increasing salinity of the River Murray is costing the nation $20m a year in lost production. To the visitor- and, I suppose, in most cases the farmer- there are very few visible signs that the river's increasing salt content is menacing. However, salinity in the river has increased by 10 per cent in the last 12 years and unless it is checked it will double by the year 2000. Our area of concern is fast spreading upstream as the salinity problems are reaching serious proportions, particularly in parts of Victoria. Just as South Australia has been to the fore in seeking political solutions to water problems it has also been in the forefront in seeking technical solutions to the problems. The recently released three volume River Murray Salinity Control Program outlines an integrated approach to tackling the salinity problem in South Australia. The total capital cost of the program will be about $15.3m, which is not a significant amount, I suggest, in view of the fact that salinity already is costing the South Australian people some $4m per annum. With increasing usage of the River Murray water, this would rise to about $10m per annum by the year 2000. The program is totally justifiable on economic, environmental and social grounds and is certain to be recommended in the final report of the salinity study being undertaken by the Commonwealth and the States by Maunsell and Partners. The technical program has been devised and, regrettably, lack of finance is the only real threat to the River Murray water quality. It is imperative that the Federal Government support South Australia's salinity program if it is to be successful in achieving its goal. It is also the responsibility of this Government to fund the program because salinity in South Australia, unlike most other water problems in the States, is due to causes outside the control of South Australia. River Murray water quality problems are affected and exacerbated by the quality of the water as it enters South Australia. I suggest to honourable members that it is a frightening fact to grasp- a little known yet devastating fact that some 800,000 tonnes of salt a year enter South Australia from upstream. As far as the sediment problem is concerned, the metropolitan Adelaide water treatment program is an important component in upgrading water quality in that State. This program has already been established and is accepted by this Government as justified. The program has been subject to careful scrutiny by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation which stated in its 1977 report:","17"
"CV4","There is a definite need to treat all surface waters being delivered to consumers in the Adelaide region. It is recommended that the program of constructing plants to treat such waters be continued and that it be completed within … 10 years.","17"
"CV4","The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has indicated that funding will be made available but- this is the problem- at a level which has, regrettably, yet to be determined. Although such support is appreciated in South Australia, the present hand-to-mouth nature of annual allocations under the national water resources program has serious implications for financial programming and maintaining efficiency of production. The financial requirements of South Australia under the water resources program will range from $ 17.5m in 1979-80 to at least $22.5m in 1982-83. This comprises $8.6m per annum for water treatment; $3.8m next financial year for Riverland salinity control and drainage rehabilitation, rising to $6.6m in 1982-83; and $5. lm, for rehabilitation of Riverland head works rising to $5. 3m. To meet these requirements the Commonwealth has earmarked $200m over five financial years for the national water resources program. This calculates to an average of $40m per year. Yet this year this Government has appropriated only $21m. When allowance is made for the national water resources assessment program, it is difficult to see more than about $3.5m per year becoming available to South Australia if this sum is divided on a population basis. This would represent only a fraction of South Australia's needs and would be a reduction on the level of funding that it has been receiving. Clearly, the Commonwealth has a duty to make available additional funds to South Australia for its water quality programs which are a national responsibility. It is also the Federal Government's duty to indicate forward commitments for ongoing projects so that State authorities can plan their water quality programs in a logical, co-ordinated and efficient way. Although the Federal Government does not have the constitutional power- I concede that it does not have it- and it cannot use the incidental powers as this would provide grounds for extensive litigation; this is not a viable option to a national solution to the problem, it does have the financial power to ensure that the problem can in fact be overcome. Failure to act on this problem will now place one of the country's most priceless natural assets at an intolerable risk, jeopardise the economy of South Australia and of the River Murray basin and face future governments with an enormous bill to pay for a problem that is worsening every day. The problem as I see it is that if salinity is not controlled along the entire length of the River Murray basin, the River Murray will act as a giant saline drain for South Australia. Farm and domestic water supplies will be tapped from a major pipeline system taken from Lake Victoria. Irrigation as we know it will cease, riverside growth will die or change dramatically. Ecological change will be drastic and the lower Murray will no longer be a paradise for fishermen and will not be so attractive for swimmers and the boating fraternity. That is not a science fiction doomsday message, but neither is it a joke. It is just one of the options facing South Australia in the light of the steadily increasing salinity control challenge for the lower Murray environment. I call on the Minister and the Government urgently to revise and increase financial assistance to the States- not just to South Australia- if this priceless national asset is to be saved.","17"
"KEO","I wish to raise a grievance on behalf of the residents of Marysville in my electorate. A number of residents of Marysville and particularly the Marysville Tourist and Progress Association have drawn my attention to the problems they are likely to experience in the near future with respect to television reception. This likelihood flows from the decision to change Channel ATV-O to Channel 10. That change is expected to take place towards the end of this year. Marysville residents presently receive reception on Channel 2 and Channel 0, and even that reception is down on the quality that residents of the metropolitan area of Melbourne would expect. At great expense, with the construction of many different types of antennae, they have tried to get channels 7 and 9 but very few have managed to obtain any reception of reasonable quality on those two commercial channels. They also receive some reception of Channel GMV 6, the Shepparton station, via a translator at Alexandra. The position is that towards the end of this year it is proposed that Channel ATV 0 will become Channel 10 and also that Channel GMV 6, the Shepparton channel which is presently received on Channel 10, will be transferred to Channel 11. Marysville has a population of approximately 600 people and there are about 300 television sets in the town, including those in some of the recently built motel units. As I think most honourable members will know, Marysville is a popular family tourist resort with a number of guest houses and motels which are very well patronised throughout a great part of the year.","17"

"EH4","The facts which underlie the series of questions which were asked in the House this morning are as follows: Under the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Act 1976, the Commonwealth Government allocates to the States for rural reconstruction money for marginal farms. It was made quite clear—","17"
"EH4","I was saying that funds are made available by the Commonwealth to the States for purposes of assistance to marginal farmers. In 1977-78, $9.6m was made available to Victoria. Disbursement in Victoria is administered by the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission, which was established under a 1961 Act of the Victorian Parliament. The Commission took over a number of early rural relief bodies, such as the Soldier Settlement Commission and the Rural Finance Corporation. The Commission is empowered to make loans to primary producers at an interest rate designed to cover the cost of borrowing and administration. Loans are usually made over the longer term. As at October last year, the interest rate was 9.5 per cent per annum and repayments were to be made over 20 years. In administering funds provided under special arrangements, such as for flood, fire and drought relief, the Commission follows principles set out by government or follows terms of agreement between governments. Generally, the Commission does not see itself as being in competition with existing financial institutions serving Victoria. It is a businesslike, complementary lender, enjoying considerable rapport with and support from these institutions. For some funds limits are imposed without special approval from either State or Federal Ministers. For practical purposes, limitations are imposed on the quantity of funds made available and on the need to spend those funds as widely and equitably as possible. The Rural Finance Corporation Act 1958, which has wide objectives of improving country production, provides that 'interest on any loan shall be as low as possible' and, unless the Treasurer approves otherwise, the loan will be not greater than $20,000. We all know that the Treasurer of Victoria is the Victorian Premier, Mr Hamer. Loans made are secured by mortgage. The mortgage does not specify the amount of the loan or the interest rate as these matters are dealt with in a letter of offer from the Commission. On 26 August 1977 two mortgages were entered into by the Commission over blocks of land totalling 4,000 acres. This is not a small farm to be consolidated; I think that honourable members would agree that a farm of 4,000 acres is a considerable property in the Western District. The proprietors of the land are Sandford Robert Beggs, Tamara Fraser, Eda Ritchie and Christina Hindhaugh, all daughters of Sandford Robert Beggs, Hugh Sandford Beggs, Margaret May Beggs, whose address is Bowral, New South Wales- I will come back to that—and Arthur Ricardo Beggs. The land is held in unequal proportions. The mortgage then is a mortgage between the Commission and those people. It is clearly a mortgage which has the approval of the State Treasurer. It is certainly a mortgage for a six-figure sum—we believe an amount of the order of $250,000. The significance of these facts is clear. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) suggested this morning, the Commission is in the business not of supporting large landholders but of supporting poor and marginal farmers, of assisting with rural adjustment and of helping people whose farms have failed to get out. The Commission clearly lends its funds not at normal commercial interest rates but at special interest rates. So it should, because the prime objective of the legislation is not to help major landholders but to help poor and marginal farmers. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has repeatedly expressed his concern about the effects of interest rates on just such people. We believe that the facts of this situation reflect on the concern which the Prime Minister has often shown. We believe that the questions and the issues are relevant to the whole matter of pecuniary interests and not only are members of parliament involved but also are members of the families of members of parliament involved in such a way that it is possible that conflicts of interest might arise. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that the loan to which I referred- a loan totalling a six-figure amount—has received the approval of the Premier of Victoria. This is not something which has simply been decided upon by the Commission, which is what the Prime Minister's statement suggested; it involves a decision made by the Premier of Victoria. Finally, I shall quote, from the brochure which is issued by the Commission, the terms under which loans are to be made by the Commission. It states:","17"
"BV4","I depart from what I intended to say simply to make the comment that once again we have seen an exhibition from the Opposition which brings no credit on it or on this Parliament. Any magistrate, any justice of the peace, upon hearing the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe) would ask at the end of the honourable member's diatribe: 'What is your allegation? You have covered yourself under parliamentary privilege and have indulged in a scurrulous, unsubstantiated, portmanteau smear. What is your allegation?' As the honourable member runs from the chamber to talk to the Press, I ask him: What is his allegation? Last year I went on record, in giving evidence to the Bowen inquiry, indicating my attitude with respect to the attacks which were made upon the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) in relation to family trusts. I just ask all honourable members to contemplate what sort of service has been done to the Parliament of this country by that performance a few minutes ago. As I dissociated myself from the attacks on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, so I dissociate myself entirely from the attacks which have just come from the honourable member for Batman. Mr Deputy Speaker, is it not a sad state of affairs when one prepares a speech which endeavours to bring a little bit of light and happiness into this Parliament and one has to spend the first three minutes of one's speech to answer a rabbit such as the one who just spoke? My grievance is that, whilst Australia is the greatest place in the world in which to live, it is a country in which far too few Australians realise and recognise that basic fact. We are the most splendidly gifted people and ours is the most richly endowed country in the world. We are the envy of millions of our fellow human beings on this earth. We have the resources. We have the means at our fingertips. All we need is the will to get up and to go. Australia on the move, Australia reaching its full potential, an Australia striding confidently through the 1980s and the 1990s on to the 21st century is my dream, my vision, and should be the aspiration of all Australians. Notwithstanding the filth that has just occurred in this place, let us as Australians in this forum, which is used all too frequently for petty politics, for once express our concern for the future of this great nation. Let us count our blessings and take stock of our achievements. Let us resolve to get the show well and truly on the road with an Australia on the move and an Australia with real determination to prosper and to succeed. It is indisputable that we have the most beautiful country in the world. We are the most richly endowed with minerals and other natural wealth. In the panoply of the Western democracies, we are, I suggest, one of the most politically stable and well balanced of nations, notwithstanding the rabbits on the other side. We have a parliamentary democracy which recognises and preserves the rule of the law. Above all, the rights and freedoms of the Australian people are the most jealously guarded in the Western world and are the envy of many nations both near to and far from our shores. Despite all the predictions of gloom, doom and despair from the Luddite, flat earth and doctrinaire socialists who sit opposite, this nation in world terms is economically strong today and will be even stronger tomorrow. Why are Australians their own worst enemies and this nation's worst enemies? Why have we become a nation which has earned us the title of the 'world's greatest knockers'? Why does this capacity for self denigration and knocking permeate our entire community, from the highest levels of government to the sporting field? We knock, we criticise, we whinge and we moan. The bleatings of a Bellyache Bill or a Whinging Willie are reminiscent of Banjo Paterson 's classic poem Riders in the Stand, as are the multitudes who scream from their pockets and knock and condemn such a superb horseman as Roy Higgins if he gets beaten on the hot favourite in the last race at Flemington. Let us for once count our blessings. We are the great Australian family. We have a fine population enriched and enhanced by millions who have chosen to adopt Australia as their native land. In particular I refer to my colleague and friend the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Burns) who typifies the quality of those who have come to this land and made it their adopted native land. Despite the obvious social evil of unemployment, an evil recognised by and of great concern to this Government, we are still seeing encouraging economic indicators which I want to refer to briefly. Inflation in this country has been halved since March 1975. Under Labor it peaked at 17.5 per cent. The inflation rate last year was 7.8 per cent. Production has strengthened in the December quarter and the predictions are that it will continue to strengthen this year. Retail sales were up in December to the surprise and delight of the retail industry in Australia, the community as a whole and the Government. Private nondwelling investment was up by 6 per cent last year. These are indicators. Private dwelling approvals were up by 13 per cent in the December quarter. There is a massive rural recovery. If honourable members do not believe it they should go into the country areas and they will see. Let me just mention some more indicators. Wheat production has doubled. World beef prices increased strongly last year and will continue to increase. Beef exports will rise again in 1979. Proceeds from wool sales were up by 9 per cent for 1978-79. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) knows that we had a good fruit season last year and that we are going to have an even better one this year. Grain crops and sales have increased. Sheep and lamb slaughterings are up by 18 per cent. These indicators are matters of substance and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, being a man of the land, will know the truth of what I say. All this is summed up by the fact that farm incomes this financial year are expected to rise by 80 per cent on the 1977-78 levels. Whilst conceding that the 1977-78 levels were a low base, an 80 per cent increase can be described only as magnificent; and not just the weather but also the policies of this Government should be given credit for that achievement. The Australian people ought to know and ought to be delighted by the fact that investment in mining and manufacturing has increased by 33 per cent in the calendar year of 1978. 1 just pause to say in country terms that on those indicators alone one could not say that things are crook in Tallarook. Whilst 7 per cent unemployment is too high and must be reduced, let us thank God that 93 per cent of the nation's work force is in employment and that overtime has risen each month for the past seven months and now is at its highest level since 1974. Employment has risen in each of the five months to November 1978, for the first time in five years. If I can take my argument a little further, in the manufacturing sector employment has increased, again for the first time in five years. Profits are up. It does not please the Labor Party, but the fact is that profits are up and productivity is up. Exports are up by 17 per cent for the three months period to January 1 979 and manufacturing exports are up by 29 per cent in the December quarter compared with the same period in 1977. Whilst this is good news, it can be better. Whilst Australia must get up and go, our home State of Tasmania must also get up and go. I endorse what has become known in our State as the Benjamin formula for the economic recovery of this nation. We must have lower interest rates and lower taxation. The entire income tax system must be reassessed. It is wrong. The harder we work, the harder we are hit. There are too many disincentives to increased effort and productivity. This year our Government is saving the taxpayers of Australia $3,000m that they would have had to pay if the Whitlam tax scales had continued to apply, and our Government is still committed to even further tax reductions. By a reduction of income tax and a reduction of interest rates this country will get back on its feet. I want to conclude with a plea, through the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) who is at the table, to the Commonwealth Department of Education to apply its mind to the increasing use of offensive language in the newspapers of Australia. I am very concerned that the thousands of young people in Australia who read newspapers read offensive words in those newspapers. Their education will be grievously affected. I refer to page 7 of today's Australian as an example of the sort of thing that is concerning me. Is it right for your children and mine to read offensive words? I refer to these words in the Australian:","17"

"KJA","The issue of having some concern for youth ought to be taken seriously by people on the other side of the House. We have heard extravagant statements about the vile and detestable policies that flow from the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. It might well be that the Government could adopt some sentimental approach to the impositions and stresses that it has placed on young people whom it cannot find a job. The Government intends to place additional pressure on these young people by threatening to take their unemployment benefit if they are not prepared to leave their homes and travel hundreds of miles away to obtain work. The Government intends to treat these people in an ignominious fashion. They will be forced to take jobs in which they cannot use their expertise or educational qualifications. Some of the special youth employment training schemes are an absolute farce. The scheme to which I have made reference is just a charade and I believe that the Minister ought to go back and have another look at it. The scheme, which is part of the National Employment and Training scheme, provides for people from 16 to 25 years to be employed so that they can develop skills. Young people are put into the work force and subsidised for 20 weeks. At the end of this period they will have developed skills and hence they are supposed to be employable. The Commonwealth Employment Service offers no expertise in this area. The employer draws up the training schedule, but facilities for developing the scheme are non-existent. I would like to give an example of how the scheme operates. Mr Murray Brown works at Orosun Trading in Melbourne and he is paid under-award wages. The CES does not supervise his training or the level of wages he is paid. The Department of Employment and Youth Affairs expects this individual to learn in 26 weeks what an apprentice is expected to learn in three or four years. Brown is instructed to learn much more than assembly work. He is obligated to work with screws and staplers and to learn planing, drilling, routing, spray painting and cutting. But he is not taught assembly work skills. He is given only a limited number of weeks to learn to use sophisticated and very dangerous equipment. He has to work with machinery that is beyond the level of simple assembly work. The CES has breached awards by allowing employers to take on ineligible trainees. Only apprentices should be employed under the awards. When employers are told that they are breaking the law they say that they are doing this under the instruction of the Minister. Another case I wish to raise concerns a curtain factory at Nunawading in Victoria. The award covering workers in this factory provides that only one junior be employed for every six adults or part thereof- namely, one to six, two to seven, two to twelve and three to thirteen. That is the order of the day. If union organisers inform an employer that he is breaking the law the person concerned says: 'That is O.K., the CES sent them along and so far as I am concerned that organisation can take the responsibility'. Therefore under the formula provided by the CES employers are being encouraged to employ young folk under circumstances in which the impossible is expected from them. These young people are expected to pursue a certain career after only weeks of training. A young person who was able to undertake successfully a course and develop all the skills required over this short period of time- and as I indicated it is impossible to achieve this- would come out as a French polisher, a cabinet maker and a wood machinist, notwithstanding the fact that these trades each require four years of apprenticeship. What happens, of course, is that individuals who are trained under these schemes do not come out with any great skills at all. In the main they are exploited by the employer and at the end of their training period they are out in the cold hard world and are replaced by another trainee. It is only a case of recycling youth unemployment. This scheme does not create one single job. The Commonwealth Employment Service is taking on people for 17 weeks. At the same time it is applying staff ceilings. If the Government wants to reduce the number of people in the Public Service what justification does it have for employing young people in the Public Service? This is just another example of recycling youth employment. The Minister advised us the other day that 1,000 young people will be taken on. I estimate that some 350 young people will be taken on by June. It has been suggested that pressure will be applied to Telecom to reduce its staff by 540 people. What sort of a joke is it? The morale of the Public Service is at rock bottom. Staff ceilings are being applied to a situation which I presented to the media just a few weeks ago in which CES employees are being forced to undertake work in an area in which they are not competent to operate. For instance, some people who are in the degrading position of not having a job are interviewed across the counter by junior officers. Notations are made on cards in respect of personal details, country of origin and other information which is totally irrelevant to whether or not a person can fit a job. This is not the fault of the CES staff or the public servants. In many cases the first job given to a junior officer involves across the counter work. A senior officer conducts one interview with the junior who is then left on his own. He is given a manual which contains all the instructions to which I make reference. How can such an officer deal with a complicated and sophisticated type of inquiry that may come from an individual who is struggling to find a job so that he can support his family. Some young girls in Melbourne who want to find work are being placed in a situation of having to prostitute themselves to keep a roof over their heads. Anyone who wants to challenge what I am saying can come down to my electorate at any time and talk to some of the girls on the streets of Fitzroy and Collingwood. That is the sort of thing to which the Government has to apply its mind. We should not be subjected to the airy fairy schemes that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs presents as a facade to the House of Representatives day after day. The Minister's youth schemes do not create one single job. All they do is recycle the young unemployed. When people employed under these schemes finish their training they go back into the dole queue. If they are not prepared to take a job hundreds of miles away their unemployment benefit will be cut off. This situation is a disgrace and the Government ought to be condemned for its policies.","17"

"JUS","On Tuesday of this week the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman) presented a document in this Parliament entitled 'A Basis for Soil Conservation Policy in Australia'. It was refreshing to note that the journalists of the metropolitan Press saw fit to comment on the presentation of that document and also to note some of its salient points and features. It is good to see that these people can sieve the wheat from the chaff. Following the example that they have given in drawing the attention of Australia to the great problems that face us as a nation unless we do something about soil conservation, it appears to be appropriate in this grievance debate to further the emphasis contained in that document. It is also appropriate to point out that even though nations may war amongst themselves, in a final analysis nature will look after those who look after it. The key to the future of Australia is not mining development or tourism, but rather the preservation of our land resources and water availability. It has been said in this Parliament that when a mine is finished it is nothing but a hole in the ground. Consequently it is absolutely essential, if we want to ensure that the marrow of the nation will not be eaten out by the diseases of soil infertility and water shortage, that we take the appropriate action. The statistics in that document reveal that 51 per cent of agricultural or pastoral land in Australia needs some form of soil containment work. The total value of affected land as assessed in 1974-75 prices amounts to a staggering $12 billion. It is disappointing to note that a recent Queensland analysis indicated that in a heavy summer downpour as much as 200 tonnes of soil per hectare can be swept away. We must do something about preserving soil and ensuring that soil conservation works, which are necessary in 29 per cent of the total arable and pastoral lands in Australia, are commenced. It is necessary for someone to take the first step even in a journey of 1,000 miles. It is time Australia gave soil erosion and water storage methods the absolute pinnacle of attention that they so richly deserve. Soil conservation is necessary not only in rural areas. It is necessary also in mining areas, in forestry, in recreation, coastal and urban areas. It was estimated in the document that the total cost of containing the problem, expressed in 1975-76 prices, was a staggering $610m. Soil erosion causes damage in two ways: We lose our fertile topsoil and the soil deposited elsewhere creates problems on roadways and in silting up rivers and streams. How do we overcome the problem? It appears to me that a four-fold attack on the problem is needed. It is the responsibility of the Federal, State and local governments and Australia as a nation. How can these respective responsibilities be carried out? The Federal Government must take an interest in the matter. We have the responsibility for exports and an overriding responsibility for the social welfare of Australia. Of course, the Commonwealth has been the leader in the general area of research. I would not want to trespass on the hallowed ground of the State governments which, under their sovereign powers, have the responsibility to ensure that land is not tampered with. Local governments have a very special role to play in respect of local zoning and in matters such as road and stream alignments. I emphasise that the ordinary people, the land owners or the lessees, have to be educated that they do not have a divine right to use land as they see fit. Rather, they have a very special responsibility to ensure that the fertility of the land is such when their day is done that future generations can enjoy the same standard of living and produce not only the same quantity of food but also the same quality of food. It is disappointing that the taxation policies of the Federal Government do not give this encouragement in the first instance. I make a special plea to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) to look at taxation legislation to ensure that where soil erosion works are done on new land prior to its cultivation, the cost of those works is written off against taxation in the first year of development. It appears to be an intolerably naive situation to say to a land owner that he can do what he likes with the land in the first instance but after he has destroyed it and done the damage we will give him an income tax concession in the year of expenditure for soil erosion works, the construction of embankments, et cetera. How much more sincere would we be in our approach to attacking the soil erosion problem if we said to the land owner, 'Protect your land before you break it up and pull down the trees and that expenditure will become a taxation concession in the year of expenditure'? The Federal Government can show a real and vital interest in this matter by ensuring that people who undertake university studies in civil engineering, urban development, mining and forestry have included as part and parcel of their courses training in soil conservation techniques. What better way would there be of assisting than by ensuring that post-graduate courses were available at colleges of tertiary education to enable people to specialise in soil conservation work. The States grant subsidies for work on soil conservation. In Queensland in 1974-75, 159 payments worth $75,921 were made. In 1975-76, 275 grants costing the Queensland Government $82,934 were made. I submit that my State is not doing anywhere near enough to carry out its responsibilities in soil conservation. I regret very much that various State Ministers have adopted a certain tool in their criticism of the Federal Government. They conclude their remarks by saying that the State government would have done so much more if the people in Canberra gave it more money. I reject that approach totally. I suggest to those Ministers who barnstorm through rural Queensland in an endeavour to obtain cheap political praise that they would be better off examining their own consciences in this area! Is it right when they are the custodians of mineral royalties in their States to claim extra money from the Commonwealth when they will not increase the royalties on mineral exports from their State or increase freight rates? Why do they not adopt the attitude that has been adopted by countries such as Iran and Kuwait which have these vital resources? These countries tell the mining companies that they own the resources and that the companies must pay a fair price for them. I believe that this is an eminently feasible proposition to adopt. In a spirit of constructive criticism, I suggest to the States that instead of asking Canberra for more money, and thus increase inflation, they look at their own situations. Local government is entitled to a special allocation from the Grants Commission in areas that are prone to soil erosion. It is interesting to note that in 1975-76 the Commonwealth Government has increased its allocation for soil erosion work by five times compared with the amount it expended in 1970-71 and that the States have only doubled their allocation. The owner is entitled to taxation concessions to encourage him to develop and use specialised machinery. Associated with the problem of soil erosion is the problem of water shortage. It would appear to me that in Australia we should have what might be termed water laws by which people are told what they can do with the water that is available. It is wrong that we do not have a situation of—","17"

The changes, lessening the impact of the unemployment forecasts, were made between the OECD secretariat's preparation of its draft report and publication of the final report. The Government rejected allegations at the time that Treasury had censored the draft. But whatever the explanation, the published version was much more palatable to the Fraser Government than the draft. Paragraph 56 of the draft report forecast some further increase in unemployment 'at least well into the second half of the year'. The version published on April 27 forecast a 'possible' further increase in unemployment, 'at least during the first half of the year'. Later in the draft, the wording, ' the outlook for unemployment in 1978 is not good' was altered for public consumption to 'the outlook for the labour market in 1978 is not strong.'. The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, was asked in Paris in June whether Press reports that Treasury had censored the report, were correct.","17"

Published: 1978 may see some further rise in unemployment at least during the first half of the year.

"EV4","To the astonishment and the amazement of everybody on this side of the House, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, who has held that position for approximately three months, made the harshest statement about unemployment in this country than has been made in the three and a half years of this Government. He replaced the former Minister just three months ago and there can be absolutely no doubt now why the Minister has been given this position. It is to do a hatchet job on the unemployed of this country. Last year in the August Budget $794m was allocated for the payment of unemployment benefits in the 1978-79 financial year. Everybody on both sides of this Parliament knows that the payment for unemployment benefits will be at least $100m more than the amount allocated by the Government in the Budget of last year. Someone, somehow, acting with the backing of this Government has to take action to reduce that amount. This is the thinking of the Government. Subsequently in his statement yesterday the Minister stated that the work test would be applied not only to the people who live in Mildura and Shepparton, the region where the work may be available—I will say a little more about that later—but also that it may be extended to Melbourne. I do not know why the Minister has looked only at the State borders or whether perhaps there will be a work test in Sydney and Adelaide to force people to go to work in those regions so far away from their homes. The Minister, according to the answer he gave in Parliament yesterday, seems to think that it is a fair thing that if these people are paid their expenses—he used the term very loosely—to go to these areas to work and they do not go, they refuse to go, the taxpayers should not have to contribute towards their unemployment benefit. It is a rather amusing thing about this Government that when, approximately one hour ago, it came to light that part of the Prime Minister's own very extremely wealthy family has been given a low interest loan of $250,000, the Labor Party is accused of muck-raking. But people who are legitimately out of work in Melbourne, who now refuse to go to Mildura to pick fruit, are going to be robbed of their unemployment benefit. According to this Government, they are dole bludgers, bludging on the taxpayers. But not the Prime Minister's family! The pensioners of this country have to forgo $27m in pension payments. This year the Prime Minister spent the $27m on VIP aircraft. The people of Australia ought to look at this Government when it makes decisions like that. There are a number of millionaires who sit on the front bench of the Government, and they make these decisions. We do not decry them their wealth. Perhaps we wish that everybody in Australia could share it so that we all could live in a privileged position similar to theirs. The honourable member for La Trobe, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and so many of their colleagues have that privilege. We demand that some conscience be shown by them when they look at the problems of people who are out of work in this country. We demand that they understand that perhaps people in Melbourne who are unemployed- many of them newly arrived migrants- would not even know where Shepparton and Mildura are. They would have no idea of the work to be undertaken. I can readily understand the problems, as I have spent six years organising workers in the Riverland fruit district of South Australia. I can readily understand the massive problems that are faced by the fruit growers of this country. But why is the Government bleeding for the fruit growers in March, when it imposed the excise on Australian made brandy six months ago? Ask the fruit growers about that decision. That is another matter that the Government sees as quite separate. It was announced on the Australian Broadcasting Commission news in Shepparton less than one hour ago that the Shepparton Commonwealth Employment Service office does not want fruit pickers and that there are no vacancies for fruit pickers in Shepparton. That is according to the ABC news. We heard the Minister telling us yesterday that if people from Melbourne did not force themselves to go there they would lose their unemployment benefit and would have to live on absolutely nothing or hand-outs from a few friends. This is far too serious a question to be left to yesterday's announcement. It is just another factor in the way in which this Government treats unemployed people. I do not rely on my own knowledge of the industry or the fact that I have had something to do with it or perhaps rely on what was said in this Parliament yesterday. Today we have made inquiries of the union that covers the fruit growing industry, the Australian Workers Union. Yesterday Mr Viner told us that expenses would be paid to the people who travel to the district. Expenses are not paid. Our inquiries of the Department this morning revealed that a person would receive a second class rail fare. I do not think any person in his wildest dreams would declare that as being expenses. As far as accommodation is concerned, if we shift thousands of people for hundreds of miles away into these districts there must be a lot of accommodation available for the people to take up, because they have got to leave their own homes. According to the people we talked to this morning, the accommodation is poor and virtually non-existent. The CES in its advertising campaign in Victoria at the moment says that people with their own accommodation, caravans, et cetera, are more than welcome'. Are all the unemployed people in Melbourne expected to buy a caravan for thousands of dollars so that they can work for six or seven weeks at Shepparton or Mildura? For how long will they be off the unemployment benefit when the job finishes and they return to Melbourne? They would have to wait another six weeks to receive their unemployment benefit. The stance taken by the Minister is quite unreal. I asked the appropriate union what sort of pay these people would get if they did go into these industries. I am told that the payment in Victoria is a bin rate of $7 a bin; an experienced picker would do four bins a day. He would earn $28. If the picker is a novice he would be lucky to pick one bin a day. No one has any guarantee of permanency. It is a question of going to Shepparton and taking pot luck. It is trite to say that there are hundreds of jobs, when there is absolutely no guarantee of getting work, particularly when people are inexperienced. Let us look at the unemployment benefit, according to the CES offices that we have contacted. If a picker were sacked because he was inexperienced and just could not do the work—I can assure honourable members, having seen the work being done, there are a lot of people in Australia who could not do the work—he would have to wait seven days before he could reapply for the unemployment benefit. If he left voluntarily because of intolerable working conditions he would have to wait another six weeks before he was eligible for the benefit. I have already explained the travel expenses, which amount to a second class train fare into the district in which the work may be available. Let us look at the unemployed figures and the registered vacancies for last month in these districts. In Shepparton there were 3,495 people registered as unemployed. There were 64 registered vacancies. That is the situation in Shepparton according to the January figures. In Mildura 2,591 people were registered as unemployed. There were 1,700 registered vacancies at the height of the harvest. I have talked with the honourable member in whose electorate Mildura is. I believe him, because the same thing happens in Renmark, Loxton, Berri and Waikerie, when he says that people living locally, even people who do not normally work during the year, take on these positions. But they return to their homes and families every night. What this Government fails to understand is that there are a lot of highly trained unemployed people in this country. The Government cannot say to them: 'Irrespective of how much training you have done, your higher school certificate or tertiary education, you are going to leave your family, you are going to leave your home. Here is a second class train fare. You are going to Mildura to pick grapes'. We in this House need to have some understanding of the industry, the plight of the industry, what it needs and the labour force that is required at the height of the harvest. But more and more this Government should have a greater conscience about the plight of unemployed people. Without this sort of attack occurring there are enough hurdles in the way of the recipients of unemployment benefits. They are financially worse off than many other people, for reasons that I will outline. They are not eligible for the supplementary rent allowance paid to other pensioners and those who have been on sickness benefits for more than six weeks. They or their spouses may not earn more than $6 a week without a dollar for dollar deduction from their benefit. Other pensioners can earn up to $20 a week without penalty. Allowances for dependent spouses and children of unemployment beneficiaries are taxable. They are not taxable for other pensioners and lone parents. They receive no fringe benefits. They have no telephone, travel, rates, pharmaceutical and other concessions. They have no pensioner health benefit card and are at the mercy of their doctors' political and philosophical views. They must produce proof of looking for work constantly, but can receive travel expenses only for jobs to which they are referred by the CES. All other expenses in looking for work must be borne personally. Unemployment benefit is withdrawn from persons whose dress is considered below an acceptable standard, necessitating constant expenditure on clothing. If an unemployment benefit is withdrawn and an appeal is lodged with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the unemployment benefit is not paid while the appeal is considered. For other pensioners, continuity of pension or benefit continues during consideration of the appeal. There are many hurdles already in the way of people who are unemployed in this country. Their dignity has already been submerged below a line which we in the Labor Party find acceptable. It is about time the bunch of millionaires sitting on the front bench of the Liberal-National Country Party Government, with all the perks of office that they have, with the privileged position that they have given themselves over the years, took into consideration the plight of unemployed people in this country.","17"

"EE6","In the context of an economy beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected would have been a prescription for accelerating inflation. Its acceptance would have been tantamount to abandoning concern with inflation, discarding our wages policies, condemning the corporate sector to an attack upon its profitability and threatening the future jobs of thousands of Australians- all at a time when the first signs of improvement in most of those respects are beginning to appear.","17"
"EE6","Bearing those words in mind, let us remind ourselves of the question asked this morning by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) when he attacked the present level of profitability of Australian companies.

That is borne out by the employment figures which I was able to announce just a moment ago. I would love to be able to incorporate in Hansard a recently published cartoon by Larry Pickering but I will read what is so graphically portrayed by Pickering. He shows a picture of the Leader of the Opposition saying:","17"
"EE6","That is what Mr Hayden is shown as saying. Then there is a person in the background—it looks like the honourable member for Port Adelaide—with an Australian Labor Party briefcase in his hand, who is quoted as saying:","17"
"EE6","How very true that is. How very much they realise that it is the economic policies and strategies of this Government which are producing the very thing for which the Leader of the Opposition called when he was Treasurer. But it is the voices in the background, the voices of the honourable member for Port Adelaide and others, which are pulling at the Labor leader to say: 'Do not acknowledge the success of the Government's policies because if you do, we the Opposition are done for.' There is a wide range of programs supported by this Government which have been supported actively since we have been in office. I point out that expenditure on training programs under the present Government has risen from $87m in 1975-76 to $182m in the current financial year. That is an investment by this Government in people. It is an investment which matches the investment in plant that we provided industry through our investment allowance policies. I also remind honourable members of the undertaking given that these programs would not be constrained by funding within the limitations of our Budget. I will state briefly the number of people covered by training schemes. I refer to the number of trainees trained under the National Employment and Training scheme over the last four years. In 1975 the total was 20,800. In the calendar year 1976-77 to 1977-78, the number trained under NEAT was 270,000. There were 135,000 trainees under the Special Youth Employment Training Program, 95,000 on-the-job trainees and 45,000 formal course trainees. The estimated number of trainees under NEAT in 1978-79 is 112,000 of whom 90,000 will be training under SYETP. The latest survey of SYETP trainees indicates that 61 per cent of trainees were in employment three months after the end of their training period. This compares more than favourably with the similar type schemes overseas. I point out that our policies are adequate.","17"

"4U4","I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill has its origin in some difficulties associated with the statutory interpretation of the statute to which the Bill refers, namely, the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Act. As I am sure the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) would understand, it has no relationship whatsoever to the substantive provisions of the Act. lt seeks to settle some difficulties that have flowed from statutory consideration by both the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court. The provisions of the two Acts- the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Act and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act- deal with the classification and reclassification of former members of the Defence Forces who have retired on grounds of invalidity or physical or mental incapacity to perform their duties. As part of its classification and reclassification responsibilities, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority determines in respect of each invalidity retiree a percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment. To determine the percentage of incapacity, the Authority, and the DFRB board that preceded it, have developed over more than thirty years a set of principles under the discretionary powers provided by the respective Acts. In short, there are three classifications and the classification into which a person retiring will move will depend on the judgment made in the past by the Authority. These principles have attracted widespread understanding and acceptance. Indeed, they had the general support of the 1972 joint select committee on Defence Force Retirement Benefits legislation which I am sure is known to most honourable members as the Jess Committee. In essence, the principles are directed to the extent to which an invalidity retiree's capacity to gain civilian employment commensurate with his skills and employment background, is affected by the disabilities that caused his retirement or by any subsequent causally connected disability. A judgment handed down in August of last year by the Federal Court of Australia has disclosed an anomaly in the legislation which prevents these principles from being given proper effect. In short, the judgment showed that the legislation as it now stands can be interpreted to recognise for benefit purposes disabilities arising after separation from the Services that are in no way connected with Service membership and which therefore had nothing to do with a member's retirement. Clearly, the assumption of an obligation to provide benefits from the DFRB and DFRDB schemes in these circumstances is well beyond the conceptual scope of the schemes and would, I suggest, be an untenable burden on public resources. This Bill is designed to correct what the Government considers to be an anomaly. At the same time, the Government has decided that, given the significant part the whole body of principles plays in determining an invalidity retiree's entitlements, it should be embodied in the law. The Bill has this additional purpose. I emphasise that the amendments do not change the long established principles followed by the Authority; rather, they are intended to confirm and ratify them in the law- I suppose I should emphasise the words 'ratify them in statute form'- and not leave them to interpretation by any tribunal. It should go without saying that there is no diminution of the right of persons affected by decisions of the Authority to seek review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If a person feels aggrieved by a decision made by the Authority, he has a clear right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I am sure that I would have the support of my friend, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) in saying that the Bill in no way interferes with the substantive rights of those who have access to the provisions of the two Acts. The questions of commutation and taxation do not arise. I only hope that the House accepts the Bill and provides it with a speedy passage.","17"
"N/A","Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned.","4","12","17","18"
"CG4","I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill gives effect to the Government's decisions, which I announced on 18 October 1978, to make certain changes to the operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal. In my statement outlining those changes, I referred to the opportunity that had been given for views to be put to the Government on this matter and to the consultations I had held with the trade unions, business and other sections of the community before the Government took its decision. Those views were fully considered by the Government. The broad purpose of the Bill is to modify the operations of the PJT by reducing the emphasis on price notification and by broadening its inquiry function. The Bill replaces the present price notification requirements which are based upon the size of a company, with selective notification of price increases for a limited period by companies following public inquiry by the PJT. Companies which have been the subject of a public inquiry may be required to notify their price increases for up to 12 months at the discretion of the PJT or for a longer period if the Minister approves. This will enable the Tribunal to monitor a company's pricing behaviour closely following a public inquiry. In anticipation of these changes, and at my request following my statement of 18 October last, the Tribunal used its exemption powers to release prescribed companies from the notification procedures. Companies involved at that time in public inquiries were not exempted. The PJT will, in future, concentrate its resources in the areas of price surveillance and public inquiry. It is well equipped to carry out an ongoing surveillance role. The PJT will be able to draw upon its bank of information on the pricing behaviour of companies. The Tribunal will also utilise the regular channels of information such as representations by consumers and user industries, commercial information and official price indices and reports. Where necessary the PJT will also seek the co-operation of individual companies in providing particular pricing information. The Tribunal will retain its power to require any company to furnish information about its prices should this be necessary and will, therefore, be well placed to examine price movements and to maintain close surveillance over prices of particular significance to the economy. Arising from its surveillance of prices the PJT will be able, at any time, to recommend a public inquiry into any company or group of companies. Public inquiries will underpin the Tribunal's surveillance role and highlight areas needing further inquiry. Presently the Tribunal is limited in the course of its inquiries to determining whether prices charged or proposed to be charged by companies are justified. This function will remain. The Bill will allow the PJT to conduct public inquiries, which do not involve price justification. These inquiries will consider matters such as the structure of prices within industries and how they are established. Turning to the way in which inquiries will be conducted and the procedures associated with this, a pre-inquiry procedure will be established in respect of prices justification inquiries initiated by the PJT. This will allow the Tribunal to obtain basic information and consult with the company or companies concerned as well as with other interested parties to determine whether a prima facie case exists for a public inquiry. The decision whether to proceed to a public inquiry will be subject to approval by the Minister in respect of inquiries initiated by the PJT. The capacity which exists for the Minister to refer for public inquiry matters arising from wage increases outside the wage indexation guidelines and allegations of excessive prices will be maintained. However, it will be open to the Minister to confine a reference to the industries to be covered by an inquiry, in which case it will be for the Tribunal to select the companies to be taken to inquiry. The Bill amends the price freeze provisions of the Act to provide the Tribunal with a discretion to allow an interim price increase to a company under inquiry. The existing provisions are unduly restrictive and can prevent companies from recovering legitimate cost increases for up to 4 months in certain cases. These provisions will not apply in respect of inquiries initiated by the Minister which do not require the Tribunal to consider the justification of the prices under inquiry. Time limits for completion of inquiries by the PJT have been made more flexible by including provisions which allow the Minister to specify the time for completion of inquiries initiated by him, and which allow the Tribunal to extend the time for other inquiries with the consent of the company concerned. The Bill modifies the confidentiality provisions of the Act so that companies may claim confidentiality in respect of documents and submissions containing secret formulas or processes. If requested, the PJT will not disclose information which in its opinion would damage the competitive position of a company, unless the Tribunal considers it in the public interest to do so. A provision is included in the Bill to allow the Minister to issue general directions to the PJT as to any matter which should be given special consideration by it in the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers. This provision will ensure that, notwithstanding its statutory independence to arrive at its own findings in particular cases, the Tribunal's operations will be placed within the framework of Government policy. The changes to the Prices Justification Act contained in this Bill demonstrate the Government's concern that in its operations the PJT should not add unduly to business costs or inhibit investment. At the same time they will ensure adequate surveillance of prices and improve the capacity of the PJT to inquire into prices that need to be examined. The PJT will be better equipped to conduct comprehensive inquiries, as the need arises, into pricing practices within industries as distinct from companies; inquiries which range beyond the narrow confines of prices justification. The Government intends that the Tribunal be employed in this role as a support where appropriate for its policies and, in particular, its anti-inflation strategy. In this regard the PJT will undertake a program of inquiries into prices within industries which are major component groups of the consumer price index, or which have a significant impact upon the level of prices in other industries. These inquiries will be broadly similar to the inquiry presently being held by the Tribunal into the processed foods industry. Apart from its price surveillance role, the PJT will carry out a valuable function of advising the Government on the structure of prices in key areas of the economy. I am confident that the business community will recognise the importance of this function and respond accordingly. I commend the Bill to the House.","17"

"ZJ4","The Deputy Commissioner in Adelaide in a memorandum dated 3 August 1977 … drew attention to the growing practice of the use of Unit trusts and family settlements carrying on trading businesses.

The second relates to the establishment of Charitable Trusts under Deed to provide funds for overseas public charitable purposes.","17"
"ZJ4","The third area causing concern in Melbourne is illustrated by the creation of 1,000 trusts under Codicils to wills—","17"
"ZJ4","Having identified some of the types of schemes, it will be helpful to list the main reasons for the proliferation of discretionary inter-vivos trusts: (i) ’The introduction of the general concessional rebate', to quote the Deputy Commissioner in Melbourne, 7 January 1977 …, 'has given a real impetus to taxpayers in both small and large businesses, with or without asset backing, to create trading trusts … ' (ii) The flat 50c in the $ rate under s. 99a is not regarded as a penal rate when compared with either individual rates of tax on substantial incomes or company primary tax plus individual tax on dividends.","17"

"JRU","The Government of which the honourable gentleman was a supporter did nothing about it. The honourable member for Gellibrand spent much of his time on the subject of trusts. I must admit that I have great reservations about the genuine use of trusts. I dislike the use of trusts that are contrived purely for tax avoidance purposes. The Government recognises that this practice exists. However, we must remember that trusts may be formed in genuine circumstances and we must be careful that in our attack on tax avoidance schemes, and in particular our attack on trusts, we remember that genuine trusts have a very necessary and continuing place in our system today. When I speak of genuine trusts, I basically refer to those trusts that are formed following the death of a parent where minor children are involved or perhaps the death of a relation where a trust is formed to provide accommodation and living expenses for other relations. I could give many examples of the circumstances in which genuine trusts are very necessary. We must be very careful in our fight against tax avoidance and particularly trusts that we recognise this fact. The honourable member for Gellibrand also mentioned the fact that we should ban advertising of tax avoidance schemes and, quite honestly, I think this is an excellent idea. It is perhaps something which could be followed up by the Government. I am sickened to see advertisements of this sort which are not used today to the extent they were some time ago. Two years ago one could pick up a certain newspaper that has an Australia-wide circulation and read hundreds of advertisements which put forward tax avoidance schemes. This sort of advertising is so demoralising to the people who genuinely pay tax. It is certainly sickening to have to put up with advertisements like this that just absolutely flout the tax laws and which are taken up usually by those people who can best afford to pay their fair share of tax. I think the suggestion put forward by the honourable member that these schemes be outlawed is an excellent one. I know from experience and from talking to people that advertisements such as these go a long way towards creating an idea in a person's mind that he can go along to a professional person, pay a fee which is tax deductible in any case and take advantage of one of these schemes that does nothing else but rob the Australian taxpayer. As I have said, already the Fraser Government has introduced legislation in this continuing war against tax avoidance schemes which will effectively bring to an end artificially created schemes. Already we have brought down legislation which deals with share trading losses. This legislation, which was introduced in June of last year, relates to what is commonly known as the Curran scheme. I am sure that members of the Opposition welcomed that legislation. We have already brought down legislation that deals with dividend stripping in an area where millions of dollars were being channelled away from government revenue. Of course, when money is channelled away from government revenue it has to be made up by the people—someone has to pay. Last year we dealt with the issue of tax free bonus snares. This practice had become a very common way for companies to distribute profits in a tax free manner. We rectified the exploitation of primary producer averaging by people who are not bona fide primary producers. We dealt with the reimbursement of dividends under which loan back arrangements are made. We also corrected anomalies in the sales tax scheme where sales tax was being avoided in the purchase of major capital items. We also rectified the abuse of gift provisions. When one looks at that list of achievements, it is very difficult for someone to stand up and say that this Government has been inactive in the tax avoidance area. I would now like to refer to the legislation before the House. This Bill of course, is the result of a statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in April last year. The Treasurer has adopted the attitude of making a statement as soon as he identifies an avoidance scheme. Legislation is then introduced. People are given a warning of what is proposed and no one can cry about retrospectivity. The legislation we are now considering covers the prepayment of interest and rent. There have been tremendous opportunities in recent years for the prepayment of interest, particularly since 1974 when many companies engaged in property development crashed. At that time companies, especially finance companies, suffered big losses. People in business who suffer a loss have been able to secure a loan from a company and immediately pay the lot back in interest. This arrangement suited the company that had the large accumulated loss because the payment of tax was not involved. Also, a tax deduction was created for the person who was securing the loan. This practice has accelerated over recent years. I am pleased to say that this legislation proposes to rectify the situation. Therefore the Bill we have before us covers the prepayment of interest and the prepayment of rent. It also covers the situation in which a person manufactures a tax deduction. As I said, as often as not these prepayments are a tax deduction for something that really is an item of capital expenditure. I am pleased to be able to say that the legislation covering these matters will be back dated to 19 April 1978, the date on which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) made his statement. The legislation also picks up other arranged schemes between associated enterprises in which a tax deduction is created for one party while at the same time the other party receives a monetary gain in a non-taxable form. This legislation goes a long way towards abolishing the known tax avoidance schemes that have been identified thus far by the Government. The second part of this Bill deals with the accumulation of trusts from profit derived from an overseas source. Honourable members will recall that the Government has already brought down legislation to deal with the return of profits from overseas sources. The legislation picks up the fact that trusts have been created to hold these profits that are derived from overseas sources in a tax free form. The High Court of Australia recently determined that foreign source income earned by an Australian resident could be accumulated in a trust without being liable for the payment of Australian tax. Tax would be payable if and when the income from such a trust was distributed to a resident beneficiary. However, often no distribution is necessary and consequently the payment is either delayed or never made. The Australian Government has been placed in a situation of not being able to get the tax which is rightfully due to it from such a source. Clause 2 of the Bill will require that the net income of a trust be calculated on the same basis as if it were the income of a resident individual. This covers the situation of a trust that is accumulating money from an overseas source so that the same rights exist in respect of trusts as exist in respect of an individual who is accumulating profits from an overseas investment. Foreign income is still subject to measures that prevent the payment of double tax. They have been in operation for some time. Australia, quite correctly, has arrangements with other countries so that people are not placed in a situation of having to pay tax in the country where they have their investment and also pay tax at the full rate in Australia. There is an arrangement to cover double taxing so the total tax paid is equivalent to the maximum Australian tax rate. As I have said, genuine business enterprises need not fear the Government's drive against tax avoidance. In fact, the Government's action in this area is necessary so it can continue with its promised reforms in taxation and eliminate tax avoidance schemes. The Government's drive against the tax avoidance industry will allow it to go ahead with taxation reforms that will benefit all genuine Australian taxpayers who choose to pay tax in an honest manner. Honourable members will be aware that as from July 1976 we were able to introduce personal income tax indexation. It is a well known fact that the Labor Government refused to do this. As a result of our initiative Australian taxpayers are paying $3 billion less than they would have paid under the old scheme. Every year that we proceed with tax indexation, as a result of our drive against tax avoidance, we save the Australian taxpayer $1 billion. Since the Government has been in power it has been able to increase the minimum income level which is exempt from tax. The annual income at which the exemption applies has been lifted from $1,000 to $3,893. We have also been successful in simplifying the tax scale from seven steps which existed when we came to power to the three simpler steps that apply now. I make this point because without a drive against tax avoidance and against those people who want to flout the tax rules, these reforms will not be possible. With the continuation of our drive against the tax avoidance industry and the affectiveness of a rewriting of section 260 of the Act later this year, hopefully these reforms will be continued and the genuine taxpayers of Australia will benefit. The honourable member for Gellibrand cited some statistics which tended to show that the number of Australians paying personal income tax has increased at a far greater rate than the number of Australians paying company tax and other forms of taxation outside the personal income tax field. It is interesting to look at some taxation figures. They show that since this Government has been in power, the Australian people have been paying less tax than they previously paid. In 1973-74, 28.6 per cent more tax was collected than in the previous year. In 1974-75- our Government was not in power then- the total tax collected was 29.5 per cent over and above that collected in the previous year. In 1975-76, the increase in tax collected over that collected in the previous year dropped to 19.6 per cent. In 1976-77, when our tax reforms started to bite, the increase dropped to 16.9 per cent. I am proud to say that in 1977-78—the last full year for which we have figures—the increase in tax collection dropped to 8.7 per cent. The increase in total tax collections last year was only a quarter of the increase that occurred between 1972 and 1975 when the Labor Government was in power. It is important to note that the figures I have cited do not contain an adjustment for inflation. If we take into account an adjustment for inflation, total tax collections last year in real terms, as opposed to an increase in previous years, showed a decline of 0.1 per cent. This Government, through its efforts to stop tax avoidance, has been able to carry on with these tax reforms which will benefit the Australian people. They will benefit the people who are honestly and sincerely operating businesses and paying their fair tax. I speak particularly of those people who by far represent the majority of the Australian people. I hope that our program to eliminate tax avoidance and our drive against tax avoidance do not strike fear and uncertainty into their hearts. In fact, these people should be heartened to know that they will be on a fair and competitive ground with those people who for so long have resorted to the use of tax avoidance schemes. I support the Bill.","17"

"BV4","I refer you to page 30 of the Parliamentary Handbook where, when dealing with the parliamentary career of the honourable member for Chifley, Mr John Lindsay Armitage, it is revealed that he was on the administrative staff of the Reserve Bank of Australia prior to 1961. 1 must say on his performance today that he has probably forgotten everything he learnt in that position, because he has used this debate not for the purpose of debating the Bill on the merits of the Bill but for other purposes. Once again the honourable member for Chifley and his colleagues on the other side of the House, with respect, have failed to appreciate the basic legal and fundamental points involved in the legislation before the chamber. They cannot understand the difference between what is a well known concept to lawyers and accountants in the business world—on the one hand tax avoidance and on the other hand tax evasion. Not simply today but on previous occasions, they have repeatedly branded as criminals those who, protected by the law for many centuries, have legally used the provisions of the law for what is known as tax avoidance. It is even incredible, bearing in mind their political philosphy, that they fail to recognise that in the United Kingdom, which at least for the time being, has a Labour Government, the distinction is well recognised. For the record I refer to the basic point so that people know when they listen to the debate or read Hansard that there were some members, at least on this side of the chamber, who understood what the question was all about. I refer to the final report of the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income published in England in 1955. Dealing with the difference between tax avoidance on the one hand and tax evasion on the other the report states:","17"
"BV4","The latter—","17"
"BV4","That is tax evasion—","17"
"BV4","… denotes all those activities which are responsible for a person not paying the tax that the existing law charges upon his income. Ex hypothosi he is in the wrong, although his wrongdoing may range from the making of a deliberately fraudulent return to a mere failure to make his return or to pay his tax at the proper time. By tax avoidance, on the other land is understood some act by which a person so arranges his affairs that he is liable to pay less tax than he would have paid but for the arrangement. Thus the situation which he brings about is one in which he is legally in the right, except so far as some special rule may be introduced that puts him in the wrong.","4","6","17"
"BV4","I refer also to the speech in the House of Lords concerning the case of the Duke of Westminster v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, reported in 1936 appeal cases at page 19. Lord Tomlin made this statement and it is still the law in England, Australia and in most countries in the Western world. He said:","17"
"BV4","Having referred specifically to the definitions, I say that I, and I believe other members on this side of the House, wish to voice our strong disapproval of members of the Australian Labor Party for casting a slur over thousands and thousands of taxpayers in this country who legitimately, after obtaining advice or indeed on their own initiative, to quote Lord Tomlin 'order their affairs so that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be'. Are honourable members opposite going to tell me that if the speed limit—I am sorry to talk in miles per hour—is 30 miles per hour people ought to be pinned who drive at 29, 28 or 27 miles per hour? That was the gist of the speech of the honourable member for Chifley. Whether he intended it or not, he cast a slur over the entire accountancy profession, the entire income tax profession, the legal profession and the business community of Australia. I am sick and tired of people such as the honourable member for Chifley casting that smear in this chamber. This Bill deals with tax evasion, in the main. I support it. Indeed, the very example given by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on page 3 of his second reading speech is a classic example of tax evasion by means of pre-payment of rent and interest. I do not believe that there would be an honourable member in this chamber who would be prepared to stand up to support that sort of activity so clearly defined by the Treasurer on page 3. The spirit of the Bill has my support. The detail of the Bill has been a matter of some discussion. Fortunately in this Parliament and in the Government parties, honourable members who are concerned whether a result may be achieved by the passage of the legislation which might not be the result which was intended, have the opportunity in the party room or in the Parliament to raise these questions. There has been no intelligent debate on the questions of detail, with the greatest respect, from the other side of the chamber. Matters of detail have been raised which ought to be considered in this debate and may even need to be considered more minutely in some later proceedings. I believe that most people interested in tax law would have read with some interest not only on the articles in the Australian Financial Review but also a letter to that newspaper from Mr A. P. Webb, Q.C. and Dr I. C. F. Spry, published on 20 February. Both Mr Webb and Dr Spry raised some fundamental questions which I hope the Treasurer, at the conclusion of the debate before the Bill passes from this chamber to another place, may be prepared to make some comment upon. I shall read three or four passages from the letter and then develop some of the matters which come to my mind which I believe are matters of substance which call for some comment, and indeed answers. In their letter Mr Webb, Q.C. and Dr Spry state:","17"
"BV4","Although it is appropriate that the Government should legislate in order to prevent loss of revenue through reliance by taxpayers upon arrangements depending upon weaknesses or defects in the Income Tax Assessment Act, amendments that are made should not be such as to obstruct and inhibit ordinary business transactions, as well as providing undue uncertainty and penalising persons acting in accordance with the law. However, the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1978—","17"
"BV4","The one we are debating:","17"
"BV4","That is, 1978:","3","4","12","17"
"BV4","… it goes far beyond those proposals.","4","6","17"
"BV4","The letter concludes by stating:","17"
"BV4","In its present form—","17"
"BV4","That is, the Bill:","3","4","12","17","18","19"
"BV4","it casts doubts on the deductibility of expenses in a large number of situations and would, if enacted, inhibit commercial activity.","4","6","17"
"BV4","I say in all humility that I am in no position to make a final definitive judgment on the views expressed by Mr Webb and Dr Spry. But Mr Webb and Dr Spry are men of such eminence and standing that the comments they made not only should be the subject of discussion and debate but also indeed should be pursued to ascertain whether they are correct. If the comments are correct a result would be obtained by the passage of this legislation which would be contrary to the wishes of this Government. We on this side of the House, contrary to those on the other side of the House, believe in private enterprise. We believe in a situation in which there is certainty of the law as to taxation matters. We believe that it is wrong to legislate, as was once said, to use a sledge hammer to crack a peanut if that is going to be the end result. I do not present myself as one of those who say that is going to be the end result, but I do say there are matters of concern.","17"
"BV4","Indeed. I thank my friend, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), for his interjection. The point that I make is that there are more intelligent people than myself in the chamber who are more qualified than myself and who can perhaps answer these queries. I say this not by way of getting out from under before the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) speaks, but perhaps he has looked at these provisions and considered the matters raised by Mr Webb and Dr Spry. He has not yet spoken in the debate. The comments I made about the previous speakers do not apply to him. Having made that position quite clear, I say clearly and unequivocally that tax evasion must be stamped out because every dollar of tax evaded is an extra dollar which has to be raised from the non-evaders, if I might use that expression. I must say that I have sympathy for the argument, which I hear repeatedly in the community, that whilst some people are able to evade their tax obligations involving large amounts—which is of course illegal—the ordinary working man in the majority of cases is not in a position to avoid or evade. So we are on common ground in relation to that matter. The prepayment of rent and interest is a contrived means of evasion. It hides the real nature of the transaction, it has the nature of fraud behind it and in my view it must be stamped out. The matters raised by both Mr Webb and Dr Spry in relation to the very substantial penalty which follows an assessment that there has been an evasion of tax, which is illegal under this Bill, should bring home the enormity of the problems facing large corporations. Some corporations might very well find that an enormous project involving millions of dollars and the welfare and livelihood of thousands of Australians could be placed in jeopardy because if a breach of section 82KH or section 82KJ of the Act were discovered the entire tax deductibility would disappear. The amount of tax evaded may be comparatively small and the total tax deduction available to the corporation could be 10, 20 or 50 times greater than the amount involved. The capacity is therefore of considerable importance because if that situation developed the company might very well become bankrupt overnight. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the tax laws which I submit are quasi-criminal to the extent that penalties of a very substantial nature are likely to be imposed in respect of breaches—must be clear and specific. I can say only that I find it very difficult to understand with clarity and precision some of the drafting provisions of this Bill. What in fact is a 'benefit'? I invite the honourable member for Hawker or any other member who can clearly explain this definition to me to do so. I do not believe that in certain areas of the Act the precision that ought to be is there. I repeat that I am not an expert; this is not a field in which I have practised at any stage of my life. I did not reach such heights. But those who do practise in the area say that there is a very great need for clarity and precision because if a person offends that person must pay the penalty. The penalty could be very substantial indeed. It has been drawn to my attention that a mining company for example, might spend $1m developing an ore body and producing copper concentrate. It would be entitled to expect some deduction for the expenditure. It might come to an agreement with a subsidiary to market the concentrate for a fee. Unless the fee is in line with market practices it becomes part of the property passing back as it is paid to an associate. But here is the slug: The company will or could lose its entire Sim development deduction even if the fee charged was only $100. 1 understand that the Mount Newman Mining Company Pty Ltd makes payments to Amax Exploration (Australia) Inc., for marketing, to the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd for operating and to the CSR Co. Ltd for Canberra liaison. If the Australian Taxation Office ruled that the transaction came within section 82KJ of the Act, the Mount Newman Co. could lose every tax deduction to which it would otherwise be entitled particularly as the legislation is retrospective to 19 April 1978. What would the effect of that be? The effect of that might well be to bankrupt the company and put hundreds of Australians out of jobs. I simply use that as an example. My colleague from Western Australia who interjected earlier will know what I am talking about. The implications for major companies in Australia, should they make a mistake under this law, could be very substantial indeed. I repeat that I am not opposing the legislation. I am simply expressing the need for absolute clarity and precision. Many agreements made between companies and their employees could endanger the whole enterprise. It is critical that the precise details, the precise implications of the legislation should be clearly stated and clearly debated, if not in this House, in the Senate, if not in the Senate, before a legislation committee. It is a matter about which I believe there is some genuine concern by many people. I am not referring to tax evaders, or crooks, but to many decent members of the community who would like to have the exact details spelled out chapter and verse so that there is no risk of injustice occurring and in particular no risk of any damage being done to the economic situation of this country. I refer particularly to the area of employment where we are dealing with major employers and large corporations. The ordinary man in the street will probably wonder what the devil we have been talking about this afternoon. The fact is that this legislation is not going to apply to the ordinary man in the street. This Bill has little if any practical application to probably 96 per cent of the Australian population. That figure could even be 99 per cent.","17"
"CV4","I support this Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. However, I do so with a deep sense of cynicism. Last March, in speaking in the Address-in-Reply debate I made the following remarks:","17"
"CV4","Who in the community is carrying the greatest share of the income tax burden? It is certainly not the rich or the well-off … They are not, according to the report of the Taxation Commissioner for the last financial year, 1976-77. If we take income as a percentage of the tax return, we find that net group tax instalments by wage and salary earners and company directors totalled 60 per cent while companies paid 20 per cent … Trusts … professionals, partners, small business and property owners paid around 19 per cent tax, and witholding tax represented 1 per cent. It is obvious that wage and salary earners have practically no avenue to evade their share of the tax burden but the same cannot be said of people who are well off.","17"
"10000","Order! I remind the honourable member that it is the practice of the House not to reflect on the judiciary.","12"
"CV4","I will observe your ruling. I want to repeat what I have said on a number of occasions in this House. The rot really set in when the High Court delivered its decision in the recent case of Slustzkin v. The Commissioner of Taxation. It reversed the decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court and decided that a dividend stripper was not taxable on a realisation of shares which related to accumulated profits. The dividend strip followed the familiar pattern of getting out profits to a shareholder in the guise of capital profit. In essence, that case differed little from cases such as the Newton, Bell, Hancock and Mayfield cases in which the High Court of the day had no difficulty in deciding that, despite the electorate facade which the taxpayers had erected around the relevant transactions, the dividend strips constituted schemes for the avoidance of tax and were caught by section 260. That provision has not been altered since it was placed in the statute book. The only change has been in the interpretation of the High Court. The High Court in Slustzkin's case completely ignored the cases which I have mentioned, and the three judges, Barwick, Stephen and Aickin did not even go to the trouble of distinguishing between these cases in any way. In the technical journal New Zealand Current Taxation of May 1977, a contributor was most critical of the Slustzkin decision. I might add that this journal is a legal publication for taxation accountants and lawyers, is completely independent, and has no association with any government body. I propose to quote freely from the contributor's comments as they are particularly relevant to the High Court interpretation of section 260. Honourable members opposite, and particularly the Government, ought to take this into account. The writer of the article pointed out that the facts of the case clearly indicate that the whole of the exercise constituted a dividend stripping arrangement and that the Supreme Court judge in the first instance so found. Slustzkin, the taxpayer, was closely associated with one Rosenblum who was a director of the company which performed the dividend strip. The whole scheme was effected at the same time, shares were transferred, consideration paid and assets stripped by the stripping company, Cadez. Cheques were exchanged between the parties and banked simultaneously. In view of this evidence the Supreme Court judge had no hesitation in finding against the taxpayer Slustzkin. The writer of the article I have mentioned stated:","17"
"CV4","The trial court held that there was a dividend stripping arrangement—see the 'New Zealand Current Taxation', Volume 21 No. 5, page 25. The learned Judge relied on voluminous evidence to support his view. The High Court of Australia reversed the decision. It is submitted that the reasoning in so doing cannot be sustained.","17"
"CV4","After discussing the Privy Council decision in the case of Europa Oil (New Zealand) Limited (1976), reported in INZ LLR546, the writer refers specifically to the reliance placed on this decision by the High Court in Slustzkin's case and went on to say, and this is particularly relevant:","17"
"0F4","In speaking to this Bill, I do not intend to deal to any great extent with the methods of tax abuse which have been mentioned or which will be overcome by this legislation. Suffice it to say that the legislation was flagged by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in 1978. It follows other endeavours by the Government to remove the abuse schemes. This is evidenced by the fact that this Bill is the fifth in a series of Bills introduced during 1978 to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. This would indicate that much was done in that year. That is not to say there is not more yet to be done. Section 260 was mentioned by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) and other honourable members during this debate. I do not think the interpretation of this section reflects on the current High Court of Australia just because of the personalities involved. It is a known fact that, for the last 15 years, section 260 has had no teeth. It is significant that during those 15 years the Australian Labor Party was in office for three years. I might ask what exactly it did about the matter. The solution is not so simple as one might imagine. When the alternative section is formulated we have to make sure that it is something that will stick and the judiciary will take note of it. Certainly, many of the decisions that have been handed down by the High Court are ones that make people in the street and in the accounting profession wonder about the legality of section 260. Curran 's case is one example. I have never seen such a lopsided decision as the one in that case. If that case was presented again on a different basis the result could be quite different. Whilst we have hopes that section 260 will be changed, let us hope that when it is changed it will have the teeth and significance that we want it to have. Certainly, as I have mentioned in previous debates on this legislation, the volume of the Act is growing at an alarming rate. It will continue to grow at such a rate while we, as parliamentarians, taxpayers and people in business, do not give any credence to, or shy away from, the discretions given to the Commissioner of Taxation. That might seem contrary to many of the thoughts of other people but I see nothing wrong in discretions, provided those affected may appeal to a board of review and have an inexpensive hearing provided they have further access to the courts. That is an alternative to the great volume of legislation Parliament has been putting through to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. A discretion here and there is not so bad as some people would suggest. It should always be kept in mind that people should have the right of appeal to a board of review and to the courts. The Bill is a substantial one, and it is intended as a deterrent against not only the schemes that have been practised up to now but also those of the future. I note that on one occasion when making an announcement about closing loopholes in the legislation the Treasurer has commented that the date from which the legislation would be effective would be applicable to future schemes which sought to avoid tax in the same way. During the grievance debate today and during the present debate, some honourable members have criticised the amount of tax that the Australian taxpayer is paying. I am not saying it is small; I am saying it is substantial. Australian tax rates are not the largest in the world today, but I do not believe that we are tackling the problem from the right end. The problem is not the rate of tax but the growing expenditure on health, welfare and education with which the Government and the country are faced today. We ought to be tackling the problem from the other end by reducing the commitments we have in these areas. I emphasise this point by presenting a few statistics to the House. In 1967-68, ten years ago, this Government had a total commitment to health, education and social security and welfare of $1,571m. In 1977-78, it had grown to $12,543m. It is estimated that figure will grow again during the current year. The expenditure has increased eight times in those 10 years, and yet the tax in that period has increased only 5.6 times, from $2,177m to $12,129m. So, the rate of taxation is not keeping pace with the amount of expenditure in these welfare areas. In 1967-68 the expenditure on those three items of health, education and welfare represented 72 per cent of personal income tax collections. In 1977-78 it represented 103 per cent of those collections. So whilst I agree with honourable members who come into this chamber and state that the tax rates are a deterrent to earning and productivity, the answer to the problem does not lie in reducing those rates but in reducing those expenditures. On reading through the report of the Australian Taxation Office and associating it with social security payments and other such expenditures, I found that in 1978-79, of every dollar that the Commonwealth collects in excise, indirect taxation and other sources of revenue, 42c will be spent on health and welfare and 23c will go to the States and local government. So on Budget day, before we can sneeze, the Government is locked into a situation of having 65c in every dollar collected being committed already to certain expenditures. I invite honourable members who decry the present tax rates to look at the other side of the picture. Certainly we should stop the abuse of the system and we should try to stop the evasion of taxation, but also we should look very carefully at trimming our commitments. There are ways in which that can be done. I invite honourable members who complain about the insufficiency of welfare commitments compared with commitments to other government initiatives to look at the fact that if we do not have a healthy economy, if we do not have incentives for taxpayers to get out and earn money productively, we will have no support for the standard of living which we currently enjoy—certainly we will have no income from which to make welfare payments to enable recipients of welfare benefits to continue to enjoy that standard of living. I believe that honourable members who extol the theory that lower tax rates would reduce the incidence of evasion of tax do so with their heads stuck firmly in the sand. A generation of tax avoiders was created in the 1970s. It has become fashionable for the average taxpayer to take every advantage, legally or illegally, and to take a chance against detection in his taxation affairs. Whilst the advisers in the tax avoidance industry are a cancer in our society and parasites within our community, they are here to stay. The only way we will be able to cramp their style will be to keep hitting them and hitting them, as we do when attacking a weed with a mower: This way eventually we might get the weed out of the ground; let us hope that we will be able to get rid of the tax avoidance industry that way also. There are abuses in the taxation area, but there are also abuses in the social security area. I believe we have to match these abuses. It is unfortunate that today the average Australian will take advantage of the social security system and will take his chances as far as taxation is concerned. Because of this, with a Budget deficit we have an expanding gap, with less taxation revenue being received and higher commitments being undertaken. In speaking prior to me in this debate, the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) mentioned that the Taxation Office would find it impossible to have the revenue that would be required for the necessary number of investigators to carry on a proper tax evasion purge. I believe that this is so and I do not know whether we can correct the situation. I certainly feel that in this computer age, when the processing of tax returns is so highly computerised, as is the situation in other areas, such as health, social security, et cetera, what we are fast requiring in this country is an identification number for every taxpayer and every citizen. Some honourable members might say that this could offend aspects of civil liberties and the rights of the individual. Those people who would decry such a system might protect their civil liberties but, in doing so, they certainly allow infringement of the civil liberties of the providers within this community. As surely as night follows day, unless something is done those providers are going to be lost or disillusioned. I believe that an identification number for every Australian, for social security, health and every other area in which he is in contact with the government, is an absolute necessity. Computerisation could carry this through. This Bill deals with those aspects of tax avoidance which are totally artificial. The prepayment of rental and of interest is an artificial device. The Treasurer flagged this on 8 June 1978. Through the Treasurer's earlier announcements he has been able to prevent much of this type of avoidance. Within the past nine months announcements have been made concerning trusts, partnerships, overseas incomes and trust stripping schemes. The aspect of tax exempt beneficiaries is one which I believe needed correction. They have been written into family trusts for quite a while. I remind members of the Opposition who talk in terms of trusts being the great means of tax avoidance in this country that if they were to read their 1976 Budget Papers they would realise what massive penalties have been imposed on trust distributions during the term of this Government- penalties which were not imposed when the Opposition has the opportunity to do so during its three years in government. This is what the issue gets back to: Are we as an opposition and a government going to act together to root out these abuses, or are we just going to sit here and every time this legislation is debated make the same type of speeches? I am quite prepared to write the speech of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) for him because every time this matter is debated his speech is exactly the same. I believe that what has been achieved in the area of tax avoidance is to the credit of this Government. We can look forward to see what still needs to be done. There will always be those people within the community with the imagination and the sense of intrigue to try to circumvent the intentions of the legislators, particularly in the tax field. This Government is applying constant pressure to make sure that avoidance schemes are outlawed as soon as they come to its notice. As I said, the Labor Opposition ought to remember that we can work in harness. It ought to remember that it created the tax avoidance industry through its high rates of taxation in the 1970s and it had the opportunity in its three years in government to do something about the problem. It has been mentioned that in tackling tax evasion we are tackling the 4 per cent who are able to afford avoidance schemes and to take advantage of them. I do not believe this House should think for a moment that the tax avoidance and evasion industry in Australia is confined to that 4 per cent. I invite any honourable member here to state that in his lifetime of lodging tax returns he has never evaded a single dollar of taxation. If he does claim that, he is probably the only Australian guaranteed a place up above because Australians have developed the habit of doing this. The honourable member for Chifley, who is so free with his advice to other honourable members on the opposite side of the chamber, ought to consider this issue and ought to probe his conscience. There are many ways in which tax avoidance could occur, even with parliamentarians. I will not mention them here although I am tempted to do so. What we need to do is to look at evasion in the areas known to us, such as the situation of subcontractors who were once employees working for carpenters and the like. I suggest that at least 50 per cent of earnings made in this way never come to the light of day as far as taxation is concerned. I refer to those fly-by-nighters who come to the cities, build up partnerships overnight, tear them down the next day, then move to somewhere else. I refer to people in cash businesses. I do not know exactly what we can do with those people unless we mark the coins that change hands. I refer also to people who have their hands in the till all the time. It is not easy to get to the bottom of the trouble there. I refer to people who receive second incomes but do not disclose them. I refer to the pensioners who have the advantage of the pension but receive a further income from a part-time or casual job. I refer to the interest received from various investments throughout Australia. Whilst records on interest are computerised and are put into areas where detection could be more likely, I often wonder whether notice is taken of these records. Whilst the purpose of this Bill is to close certain avoidance areas, I would like to speak in terms of areas in which tax equity is also involved. I suggest to the Treasurer and to the Government that one particular area in which tax equity does not exist is the area of the spouse rebate. I believe that one of the main causes of income splitting and tax evasion is the fact that in the separation of income between husband and wife or between parents and children the ceiling of $3,893 is enjoyed not by just one person in the family but by many members of the family. I would suggest that, if this Government is genuine in wanting to give equity to the spouse who stays at home and looks after the family and the house while the lone income earner is out working, that spouse should be given greater recompense; and this could be indexed almost to the tax ceiling arrangement. One alternative is for a husband and wife who are now able to enjoy two tax ceilings to be allowed only one tax ceiling and taxed as from zero on the balance of their joint income. That might be one suggestion. It will certainly be a means of generating income where it is not a matter of an expenditure or an allowance. But this proposal has difficulties in that more couples might live in sin but still under the same roof. The other alternative is for the rebate for the dependent spouse to be lifted to a figure equal to the present second ceiling. At the moment that second ceiling is $3,893 which when taxed at 33.5c in the dollar gives $1,304. If we add to that amount the $595 that is already allowed to the spouse for additional expenditure and housekeeping, we get the figure of $1,899.","17"
"10000","Order! The honourable member's time has expired.","12","18","19"
"XJ4","This legislation continues the interminable series of Bills designed to plug the tax avoidance schemes with which this Government is plagued. It is a little like the boy with his finger in the dyke or perhaps like Horatio defending Rome against the Barbarians. Perhaps the Treasurer (Mr Howard) sees himself as a valiant defender of the Treasury against those who would assault the Federal revenues. In his second reading speech he said that it was the Government's intention that income tax avoidance legislation should be retrospective to the date of the announcement. Then he said that he was convinced, however, that this was the right way to take action against what, in most instances, were blatantly contrived and artificial arrangements. If he wants to be even more effective, I advise him to accept our suggestion that all income tax avoidance legislation be retrospective to the beginning of the current year. More to the point, when will he undertake the task of rewriting section 260 of the Act to simplify the whole procedure? I know that that task will be like cleaning out the Aegean stables, but the longer he postpones this Herculean but vitally necessary task, the longer we in this place will be subjected to these interminable piecemeal attempts to stop the tax cheats. How cunning they are. This legislation prevents the schemers from securing income tax deductions for pre-payments of expenditure which involve payouts of sums which are substantially less than claimed. It is staggering to see the Treasurer of the Australian Government describing in this Parliament a scheme whereby a taxpayer can obtain a loan, immediately pay back most of it as an interest-free payment, buy back the right of the loan for a much smaller amount and then claim the so-called interest payment as a full tax deduction. How much longer do we have to fight a defensive battle against this sort of thing? Why is the ordinary wage earner harassed through the courts when, say, an incorrect deduction for a working wife is made but no punitive action is taken against these high income frauds? I could refer to a case I encountered recently where a low income worker inadvertently over-claimed for his working wife. She had earned the magnificent sum of $1,500 for the year. He was summonsed at short notice before the New South Wales court, even though the $370-odd involved was immediately offered to the Commissioner. What a contrast with the lenient treatment of the quasi-legal tax frauds. At least the Treasurer now seems to be spared the waitings of those in his own party who would oppose retrospective legislation as a means of combating these fraudulent machinations. During the consideration of the recent Bill to outlaw the Curran scheme, I, like many others, received a veritable barrage of letters urging such things as the application of the rule of Roman law. A former Liberal Prime Minister was a leading exponent of this argument, but it was always a question of the use of legislative power in the common interest—not law but power. The people who use the retrospectivity argument to support the tax dodgers use legislative power unhesitatingly to attack people such as pensioners. So why do they shrink from the use of power to prevent these raids on the national exchequer? One can support the decision to tax income from overseas sources that is paid into and then derived from a trust or partnership. It seems that once again the High Court of Australia decided, on a strictly legal interpretation of tax laws, to benefit tax avoidance. As the law stands, people can escape being taxed on an income earned overseas and accumulated in domestic trusts. Certainly it is time that this matter was attended to. But what about the use of family trusts here in Australia as an income splitting tax avoidance measure? These schemes are used by the very people who can afford to pay tax. They are practically not available to ordinary people. In their simplest form they involve the distribution of profits to beneficiaries being included in total taxable income, and only normal personal income tax is paid. As an example, $50,000 distributed to five beneficiaries would raise a total tax of only $10,225. If the full amount had been taxed $22,470 would have been raised. So $12,245 has been avoided in that hypothetical exercise. Let us see what could be done. Company tax of 46 per cent could be applied to trust incomes before distribution and then sums distributed to beneficiaries should be included as taxable income. This would give a total tax payable in this exercise of $25,520 or over $15,000 more than is currently payable by anyone using these trusts to avoid their legitimate tax obligations. Is the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) using such a simple family trust as this? When will he release details of his own tax avoidance? What about the broken pledge to tax foreign dividends received by Australian companies which are now totally free of Australian company tax? I remind the House how in June last year the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said this was an intolerable position and would be cleaned up. But on 25 October last year he cravenly informed us that such legislation would not proceed. Why was this decision made? The fair taxing of overseas earnings of Australian companies is overdue for two reasons: Firstly, because of the revenue involved; and, secondly, to prevent Australian companies deliberately relocating overseas to take advantage of low tax structures and tax havens. In the research report of the Bureau of Industry Economics entitled 'Industrialisation in Asia—Some Implications for Australian Industry', we see the following statement:","17"
"XJ4","The developing Asian economies are attractive for off shore investment for reasons additional to the availability of relatively low priced labour. Most of the countries offer a generous set of incentives for the establishment of industries, companies tax holidays—and a disciplined labour force.","17"
"XJ4","A good many Australian companies have already taken advantage of these attractions. What is the Government going to do about taxing their earnings? As the Australian Financial Review says, about 25 per cent of a sample of 120 Australian companies have subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong or other tax havens, among them the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Acmil Ltd, Bradmill Industries Ltd, Comalco Industries Pty Ltd, Dunlop Rubber Australia Ltd, Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd and a number of smaller manufacturers. There is a rapid fall in employment in the Australian manufacturing sector. The Australian Manufacturing Council reports that employment in Australian manufacturing is currently down about 200,000 persons on the peak reached five years ago. The Council also says that 91,500 jobs have been lost in the last year. It predicts a further 80,000 people a year will be unable to get jobs in manufacturing from now until 1986. We should consider very seriously whether Australian manufacturers should be encouraged to re-locate in South East Asia simply to enjoy a tax holiday'. As we hear so often, the Australian services sector has been the big growth area in the last two decades. Now new technology will reduce employment there too- particularly in banking finance. One reads that employment in banking will decline by 40 per cent in the next 10 years. The Commonwealth Employment Service document entitled 'School Leaver Survey in NSW and the ACT' presents a generally gloomy picture of overall employment prospects for young people in the years ahead in the retailing, manufacturing, finance, insurance and construction industries. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research estimates only a 2.3 per cent growth rate in the non-farm sector this year. It says that at least a 4 per cent growth rate is required if unemployment is not to worsen. So unemployment will continue to increase. It is against this worrying background that the Government refuses to discourage the haemorrhage of Australian investment funds overseas. During the controversy over this proposed tax on off-shore earnings last year it was said by the Australian Financial Review that 'Australia was taking the first steps on the international tax gathering road'. The United States of America and other nations already implement this tax on foreign company dividends. Because of the Treasurer's craven refusal to proceed with this tax, Australia will not now take even the first timid step. The Treasurer is implementing this income tax legislation for one reason- the Government needs the money. It will need to do more if it wants to contain the 1978-79 Budget deficit to the Budget figure of $2,813m. For instance, the Budget estimate of $785m for expenditure on unemployment benefit will be well exceeded. It will be more like $950m. Now that the Government has renounced a retail turnover tax or value added tax, we can expect the Treasurer to be looking for other means to raise income besides just plugging tax avoidance schemes. What will happen to the 1.5c in the dollar income tax surcharge the Government is committed to discontinue in the next financial year? Will it be tempted to retain the surcharge and thus add another broken promise to its already long list? The great temptation to implement a VAT stemmed from the perceived need to abolish or reduce State payroll taxes which I agree can be portrayed as a tax on employment. But how to recompense the States for the $1,500m so forgone was the $64 question. The rationale for a broad indirect tax on consumption was ill considered, but there is a need to raise extra revenues without raising income tax on low and average wage and salary earners. The Government should now consider other forms of taxes as an alternative to the value added tax. We are possibly, despite what the Prime Minister tried to put over today, the only advanced Western industrialised nation without any tax at all on capital. The United States has levied a capital gains tax since 1913. Short term capital gains are taxed at normal rates, while longer term gains are taxed at 50 per cent of the net gain at normal rates or on a special rate of 25 per cent on the first $50,000 and 35 per cent thereafter. The United Kingdom also imposes a capital gains tax at 50 per cent of the full taxation rate for the first £5,000 of gain and the full rate thereafter or at an alternative flat rate of 30 per cent. Such countries- this is important with regard to what the Prime Minister said today have general exemptions for principal private residences, personal goods and chattels, such as cars and so on. That is obviously what we ought to be doing in Australia. Perhaps also there is a very strong case for the imposition of a wealth tax, because in Australia one per cent of our people own 22 per cent of accumulated wealth and the top 5 per cent own 46 per cent of all accumulated wealth. Some of these are the very people whom the Treasurer is now seeking to prevent from avoiding tax. Simply speaking, the Australian Government could tax 46 per cent of Australia's privately accumulated wealth by taxing only the richest 5 per cent. It is difficult to calculate the appropriate threshold level at which this tax could be imposed in such an exercise, but my guess is that the threshold level would be no less than $100,000. So why is it that the Prime Minister deliberately seeks to mislead this House and the Australian people when he says that capital gains taxes will affect ordinary people's homes or that the Opposition would levy wealth taxes on workers' savings? He is misleading the nation and misleading this House. The Prime Minister has referred in his so called 'state of the nation' speech to a range of possible capital investments in Australia. He does not say that his optimistic, euphemistic assessments almost totally involve the exploitation, and in some cases the processing, of our precious non-renewable mineral and energy resources. It cannot be said that these projects will be labour intensive. It can be said that there is a need for a resources tax to tax adequately the rapid exploitation of non-renewable energy reserves. The diminution of these reserves can be just as real through the use of massive amounts of Australian energy in the upgrading of raw materials such as bauxite to alumina and aluminium as through the export or domestic use of the actual raw energy. The refusal of this Government to implement a resources rent tax on a company by company or development by development basis at an appropriate and acceptable threshold level of profits, expressed as a percentage of capital investment, amounts to the allowance of tax avoidance on the grandest of scales. Let us take the case of the Utah Development Corporation. Certainly, its profits fell from $ 158m to $ 138m last year.","17"
"XJ4","Yes, that was after paying tax. But the decision to impose a branch profit tax of 5 per cent on dividends remitted overseas raised only a miserable $13m. A resources tax would have raised at least four times that amount. The profit for Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, based on normal accounting methods, was $161m for the last six months of 1978. The majority of that profit came from the company's oil and gas division. This raises the spectre of the Government's misguided crude oil policies. We know that the present import parity policy will return $700m this year to the Federal Treasury. But this return will decline as the percentage of old oil returning full parity prices to Esso-BHP phases up year by year until it reaches 100 per cent. So in this case, Esso-BHP stands to make a yearly windfall profit ranging from $300m this year to $700m in 1980-81. There is no adequate tax mechanism. The Esso-BHP consortium is making these millions of dollars of profit solely as the result of a Government decision. There is no adequate tax mechanism for the years ahead. The $3 per barrel levy will be insufficient when the 1977 policy is phased up to full maturity. Honourable members opposite cannot deny that. In addition, there are no guarantees that any of these ad hoc measures will result in conservation of oil or that the majority of the windfall gains will be used for oil exploration. Aside from Bass Strait, only $143m has been allocated—","17"
"10000","Order! The honourable member's remarks are not altogether relevant to the matter before the House.","12"
"XJ4","I take your point, Mr Deputy Speaker. However, I ask you to take my point also. I am arguing that the lack of an appropriate taxation mechanism on oil profits which results from a Government decision has led to the most massive tax avoidance. At any rate, I accept your ruling and I will continue with my remarks. The oil companies tell me that the oil exploration dollar is a mobile dollar—","17"
"10000","Order! The honourable member's time has expired.","12","18","19"
"PD4","If anyone had any doubts about the intentions of the Australian Labor Party with respect to the introduction of a capital gains tax before the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) spoke in the debate, those doubts must now be put at rest. The honourable member made it plain—I give him full marks for his open and candid concession—that a Labor Government would introduce a substantial capital gains tax at the earliest opportunity. As one reason for that he advanced the fact that the United Kingdom has a capital gains tax. I would have thought that that was a good reason for not introducing a capital gains tax. We should look at the way in which incentive has been taxed so heavily in that country with the consequent economic difficulties that face it. This much must be clear now: The intention of the Labor Party is to introduce a capital gains tax. The only additional remark I make about that subject is that although the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) seems to have been saying that the tax would start at a capital gain of about $200,000, the honourable member who has just spoken in the debate has cut that figure in half and has said that the capital gains tax would start at $100,000. Presumably, the amount will come down. The Australian people should be warned at this early stage that if the Labor Party ever came to government in this country again, there would be a very real risk that it would seek to introduce a capital gains tax. I return to the subject matter of the Bill which is presently before the Parliament. The first point that strikes me about the debate we have had today is that there has been such an air of piety and righteousness about it that honourable members could be excused for thinking that they were in church rather than in the national Parliament. It seems that everyone hates what we call the tax dodger. Everyone hates those people who arrange their affairs in such a way within the law to lessen the incidence of taxation falling on them. Let us look at the realities of the matter. Of course, there are people who will and do—probably they always will—arrange their affairs in such a way within the law that the incidence of taxation falls on them more lightly than it otherwise would. But instead of abusing them, instead of abusing the system and instead of calling for the banning of things such as advertisements for tax avoidance schemes, we would much more profitably spend our time if we asked: Why is it that so many of the best brains in the country and so much of the effort of professional people in this country are put into schemes which are designed to lessen the incidence of their income and company tax? The reason for it is plain. The rates of taxation are so high that many people are forced into a position in which they must take steps that they would otherwise not take to lessen the burden of taxation imposed on them. There are so many people in the community today—professional people, business people and ordinary average wage earners such as skilled tradesmen—who are bearing such a heavy burden of taxation that they are forced to adopt what are in many cases devices and in other cases quite legitimate re-arrangements of their affairs to reduce the burden of taxation on them. They do this because if they did not embark upon such a course they would be crippled financially. There are many professional and business people who now do not work a full week. There are many people who will not invest in businesses, who will not expand their businesses, who will not take on new employees and generally will not contribute to the expansion of commerce and industry in this country because there are no longer rewards for them in doing that. The reason there is no reward or a very slight reward is mainly the taxation system. I put it to the House that instead of pointing the finger at people who re-arrange their affairs so that the burden of tax imposed on them is lower than it otherwise would have been, we should recognise that the reason so much effort goes into schemes designed to lessen the tax burden today and so many brains are directed at this objective is due to the heavy burden of taxation. This Government itself has sought to lessen the burden of taxation and I commend it for that, but our continuous objective should be to reduce substantially the burden of tax in this country. I believe that it is a reasonable expectation that a lot of the effort that presently goes into tax avoidance and tax lessening schemes would evaporate as the tax rate was reduced. I should like to direct some remarks to the Bill which is presently before the House. I do not want to go into a detailed analysis of some of the complex and intricate provisions contained in this Bill. I do want however to try—","17"
"10000","Order! The honourable member will address the Chair.","12"
"PD4","I would not go so far as to say that the Bill should not be proceeded with in its present form. I merely draw the attention of the House—as did the honourable member for Denison—to the fact that there are what would appear to be defects in the drafting of the legislation. I believe that the Treasurer should have regard to those defects. They are, at least in one case which I will mention in a moment, defects which may well defeat the revenue. In other words, the Government may not achieve what it hopes to achieve by this Bill. So in fact we are doing the Government a favour in drawing its attention to errors in the legislation that perhaps could be rectified to ensure that these particular tax avoidance schemes are blocked. To direct a few brief remarks to some of the specific matters referred to by Mr Webb and Dr Spry, may I refer initially to proposed new section 82KJ. That seems to contain a particular problem as far as I can see. That problem is that proposed new section 82KJ, which is endeavouring to stop the device related to pre-payments of interest and pre-payments of rent and other outgoings, states in part:","17"
"PD4","… the amount of the loss or outgoing was greater than the amount (if any) that might reasonably be expected to have been incurred …","4","6","17"
"PD4","When legislation contains a provision like that I think a warning light should be flashed. What it means in this case is that the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of Taxation will make assessments of what a particular loss or outgoing should have been. When public servants and particularly the Commissioner of Taxation have the opportunty to make their own assessments of commercial transactions, in effect to rewrite commercial transactions and dealings between citizens, that is a situation we should be wary of. I am not suggesting for the moment that this legislation should not proceed because it gives a wide discretionary power to the Commissioner. I am merely drawing attention to the fact that we continue to pass legislation which increases the discretionary power given to the Commissioner of Taxation and that that is something that we should be very wary of. The second point to note about new section 82KJ is that it would appear that it is the whole of the loss or outgoing that is disallowed and not only the excessive part- if one likes to call it that- which arises by virtue of there being a tax avoidance agreement. I suppose some people might say: 'Well, you should not have too much sympathy for people engaging in this activity which is after all a form of avoiding income tax.' To some extent that view is correct. But I put it that if the objective of the exercise is to prevent an excessive loss or outgoing being allowed as a taxation deduction, really the only reasonable position to take is that it should only be that excessive part of the loss or outgoing which should be disallowed and not the whole of the loss or outgoing. In other words, the excessive claim that comes as a result of taking part in a tax avoidance agreement should be disallowed but not the entire loss or outgoing. That is something to which I hope the Treasurer will have regard now that it has been drawn to his attention. Without taking any time to discuss it, the second matter at which I hope the Treasurer would have another look at some stage is proposed new section 100a. I hope in particular that he would look at the definition of 'reimbursement agreement' and then the definition of 'agreement' itself. I might say that it is a strange form of drafting to have a definition of reimbursement agreement and subsequent to that a definition of agreement but I leave the peculiarity of the drafting to one side and say merely that the provisions which are contained in this Bill, because of the very broad definitions that are given there, are such that they may well have to be re-examined at a later stage. I merely draw attention to those definitions and to the comments made by Mr Webb and Dr Spry in their letter with respect to those definitions. Thirdly, I emphasise that there is once again a danger in increasing the discretionary power which is given to the Commissioner of Taxation. It is a discretion which has to be exercised properly and one would hope that it is a discretion that would be exercised widely. But we must make sure that the law is clear and that the taxpayers know the limits of the law to which they can go to organise their affairs to reduce the burden of income tax on them, if that is their objective. They are the only specific matters to which I wanted to refer but I want to return very briefly to the initial point I made. This seems to apply not only to Australia but is something which is quite common in most countries with which we like to compare ourselves. I refer to the continuous taxation burden on productive people in the community and the effect that taxation burden has on the expansion of industry and commerce and on the contribution of people who can make a real contribution to the community. Incentive is undoubtedly being sapped by the present taxation burden. I venture to suggest as I have before that the solution to many of the Government's economic problems is to reduce the taxation burden very substantially indeed; not only would that have the result of taking away the need of people to engage in activities designed to reduce their level of income tax, but also it would act as a positive incentive to people to go out and to invest, to start businesses, to expand businesses, to employ people and to contribute to the overall wealth of the country.","17"
"KN9","On previous occasions I have used harsh words about tax avoiders and have said that they are bludging on the rest of the community. Indeed, that is what they are doing. The tax avoider is completely lacking in any morality because the additional tax burden is invariably thrust upon some other person who is financially less capable of carrying that burden. Unfortunately the question of financial morality never seems to receive due consideration by the courts which seem to be concerned only with a legalistic approach. The courts seek to put a blessing on tax avoidance as distinct from tax evasion. The dictum of Lord Tomlin is often quoted in support of that distinction. In the case Inland Revenue Commissioner v. Duke of Westminster, …","17"
"KN9","which is a United Kingdom case:","4","6","17"
"KN9","Lord Tomlin said: Every man is entitled if he car. to order his affairs so that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be. If he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result then however unappreciative his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay the increased tax. To my mind that is putting a blessing on tax avoidance. It certainly does not class tax avoidance in the eyes of the learned justice as something that should be frowned upon, nor does it suggest that the person who does avoid tax should be frowned upon for making someone else carry his burden. The learned justice called it an ingenious trick, and said, however unappreciative his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity'. In other words, he is saying that it is an ingenious trick and he sort of compliments him for it.","17"
"KN9","I say advisedly that while ever we have this attitude in the judiciary it does not lead to a serious example of honesty because it is certainly not an honest practice to expect other people to force someone else to pay their share of the tax burden. Perhaps the tax avoider cannot be compelled to pay increased tax, but surely there must be some question of morality in this whole issue. To my mind there is no difference between tax avoidance schemes and tax evasion schemes, other than legalistic difference. They are both morally wrong and destroy any equity in the payment of taxation. I used a simple example when I made reference to tax avoidance in this House on 5 May 1978. I think it applies equally today. To my mind it is the same as a homicidal maniac saying: 'I did not murder that man, I only put him out of his misery', and then seeking to justify his murderous action in that way. I put the same distinction between the act of a homicidal maniac and the act of a tax evader or tax avoider, whatever we like to call him. I wonder just how sincere the Government is in its statements regarding its attempts to close off the various tax avoidance schemes which are presently in existence. They will undoubtedly be in existence in the future. Of course, the main supporters of the Government are those people who have a vested interest in tax avoidance schemes or in tax evasion. They are the only ones with sufficiently high earnings to be able to engage skilled lawyers and skilled accountants to help them in their nefarious schemes. Honourable members will notice that these tax avoidance schemes are not practised by the ordinary working man—the man on wages. He does not have the opportunity. He might try to chisel a little on some concessional deductions, but that is only peanuts in the general scheme of things. The ones who are robbing this country right and left are those whom I call the big people of the country.","17"
"KN9","I am glad that the honourable member for Sydney has reminded me that the lawyers, the professional men, the doctors and certain taxation avoidance accountants are the ones who are getting away with millions of dollars. It is those people whom the Government should be setting out to catch. I compliment the Treasurer on the actions which he has taken. I must admit that I have been criticised in some of my own Australian Labor Party branches for complimenting him on the actions which he has taken. I have been criticised on the basis that there is no such thing as a good Liberal. But there are some good Liberals. I am not saying that the Treasurer is in that class. But there are some good Liberals, the same as there are good Christians and bad Christians. In recent times the Treasurer made a statement that he was seeking to flush out the tax avoiders. But I think, if I heard accurately what was said in the House today, it was said that a paper fell off the back of a truck. Many trucks are roaming round Canberra these days with paper falling off them. The paper which fell off the truck contained some fairly confidential information consisting of recommendations from either the Treasury or the Taxation Office—I know not which—to the Government on which tax avoidance schemes and loopholes should be closed off. I think the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) mentioned this in his speech and the honourable member for Chiefly (Mr Armitage) followed it up in his speech. The point which was made previously on this issue is equally valid now. Certain recommendations which are made to this Government by the skilled experts in the Taxation Office and the taxation section of the Treasury are not implemented. There are reasons for the non-implementation of certain of those recommendations. There are a few guilty consciences not only amongst members of the present Liberal-National Country Party Government but also amongst a few members of the judiciary. I shall not name those with the guilty consciences. I would not reflect on the judiciary in any shape or form because I think members of the judiciary are all honest men. It could be said that certain people, honest men, do take advantage of tax avoidance schemes through family trusts and so on. I would not denigrate the actions which they take. Presumably they are honest men, otherwise they would not be appointed to the judiciary. Be that as it may, it is a fact that people in high places, even within this Parliament, have practiced tax avoidance schemes.","17"
"KN9","In some part the Treasurer was right. He stated further:","17"
"KN9","As new forms of tax avoidance are identified, announcements indicating the appropriate legislation to be introduced will be made and that legislation will be effective from the date of such announcements.","4","6","17"
"KN9","However, there is much more to be done in this field of tax avoidance. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a question and answer which appeared in the Senate Hansard of 21 February 1979. The question was asked by Senator Evans of Senator Carrick, the Minister representing the Treasurer.","17"
"KN9","Leave granted.","12","18","19"
"KN9","The document read as follows—Australian Taxation Office: Investigating Officers (Question No. 1119) Senator Evans asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 November 1978: (1) Will the Treasurer provide a table showing, for each financial year from 1973-74 to 1977-78 and from 1 July to 23 November 1978, the average annual employment in the Australian Taxation Office of officers whose main function is to investigate taxation returns. (2) Will he, in each case, show, a nearly as can be estimated, the number of officers investigating: (a) returns by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers; (b) returns by companies; (c) returns by business and professional persons, including primary producers; (d) returns involving investment and property income; and (e) returns of trust estates and partnerships. Senator Carrick—The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: (1) The following table shows the average number of officers engaged during each year on investigation activities: (2) The number of officers engaged in investigating different categories of income tax returns is not available. It is estimated that the time spent by Taxation Office staff in relevant years on investigation activities was devoted to companies and other taxpayers in the following proportions:","4","12","17"
"KN9","I thank the House. I refer to the table contained in the question. Senator Evans asked the Minister representing the Treasurer to provide a table showing for each financial year from 1973-74 to 1977-78 and to the end of Nevember 1978, the average annual employment in the Australian Taxation Office of officers whose main function was to investigate taxation returns. Senator Evans asked that the Department provide information as to the number of officers investigating taxation returns on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers and returns by companies, business and professional persons including primary producers. There are still vast avenues for alleged Pitt Street farmers to evade taxation and probably there always will be. Senator Evans asked for details of returns, of the time spent by investigators on returns involving investment and property income returns and returns from trust estates and partnerships. Unfortunately for the senator the departmental statistics were not sufficient to enable an answer to all those questions, but a few pertinent points stand out. I shall put them on the record. In 1973-74—our year in government—there were only 545 taxation investigators in the income tax field. In 1974-75 our Government increased the number to 599- certainly not enough. In 1975-76 after much prodding the present Government increased the number to 679. In 1976-77 the number decreased by one. Somebody must have died or got sick of the place and left. In 1977-78 the number was reduced by one. Somebody must have become further disenchanted and dropped out. The Government could not give us up-to-date figures from July 1978 to November 1978. But the break-up of the time which has been spent on company investigations is the eye opener. In the period 1974-75, during the Labor Party regime, 23.8 per cent of income tax investigators' time was spent on the investigation of companies and 76.2 per cent of their time was spent on the investigation of the little man. In 1975-76 the percentage of time spent on companies decreased to 23.2 per cent and the percentage of time spent on the little man increased to 76.8 per cent. In 1976-77 the percentage of time spent on companies was 23.2 per cent and the percentage spent on the little man was again 76.8 per cent. In addition to that the Government has appointed what it calls 'field audit officers'. These field audit officers do not touch companies. They concentrate on the little man. In other words, the taxation officers concerned- I do not know whether this is policy but I think it must be- have a clear direction from this Government to concentrate on the little man and let the big man go, whether it is referring to a company or what have you This Government must stand condemned for its attitudes on this matter.","17"
"ZD4","in reply—I always enjoy a debate on this subject. I always enjoy listening to the honourable member for Banks (Mr Martin) and I always enjoy hearing the remarks of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who really exhibits all the signs of somebody trying to get in on an act about which his own Government when in office did precious little. I welcome the support of the Opposition for this measure. I shall respond in broad terms to the points that have been raised. I invite any honourable members who doubt that the Government is continuing in its campaign against blatant tax avoidance to come back after the suspension of the sitting because I have another announcement to make on the subject which they might be interested to hear. There is one thing of a semi-personal character that I would like to say in this debate. I really think it is appalling on the part of the Opposition constantly to make specific allegations of tax avoidance against honourable members on this side of the House. I think it is a state of affairs that does not do credit to the importance of the matter which is under discussion. I can say unequivocally to the Opposition and to all honourable members in this House that the campaign that has been undertaken by this Government against tax avoidance has the very strong support of the entire Cabinet and indeed of the overwhelming majority of my own parliamentary colleagues.","17"
"N/A","Question resolved in the affirmative.","18","19"
"EE6","That the Bill be now read a second time","12","17","19"
"EE6","The purpose of this Bill is to provide for certain antitrust judgments of foreign courts not to be recognised and not to be enforceable in Australia. This is not the first occasion that efforts to enforce the antitrust laws of other countries have led to the introduction of a Bill into this Parliament. Honourable members will recall that in 1976 the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act was passed to prevent Australian-based evidence from being used in foreign legal proceedings to which there was objection from the Australian point of view. That Act is not confined, as the present Bill is, to antitrust proceedings. However, as the then Attorney-General, Mr Ellicott, explained in introducing the 1976 Bill, the need for it had arisen out of legal proceedings that were being taken in the United States of America under the antitrust legislation of that country. Those proceedings related to arrangements alleged to have been made in 1972 for the marketing of uranium. The proceedings included a grand jury inquiry and civil proceedings by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation claiming some $7 billion from 29 United States and foreign uranium producers, including 4 Australian companies. Mr Ellicott's second reading speech in relation to the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Bill also explained that in the proceedings I have just mentioned claims were being made that the antitrust and related laws of the United States had a greater extra-territorial operation than that generally conceded in international law, and beyond what other countries were prepared to concede in the proceedings. That was the reason for the enactment of the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976, under which orders may be made on the basis of noncompliance by a foreign court with international law or comity, or on a need to protect our national interest. Two orders were made under the Act and remade following the enactment of certain amendments to the Act. Both the orders related to the uranium marketing arrangements I have mentioned above and were based on the need to protect our national interest. The orders have been effective in preventing the Australian-based evidence from being used for the purpose of the United States proceedings. I am pleased to be able to inform the House, moreover, that the grand jury inquiry into the uranium marketing arrangements has been concluded and that no proceedings by the United States Justice Department have been instituted against any Australian company in consequence of that inquiry. The civil proceedings in which the Westinghouse Electric Corporation was claiming treble damages from the uranium producers are, however, still pending. In those proceedings nine non-United States defendants declined to enter appearances. They did this because they considered there were jurisdictional objections to the proceedings against them and that they might be taken to have waived those objections if they were to enter appearances. The effect of their not entering appearances has been the entry by the United States court of a default judgment against them. The amount of the judgment still has to be determined, but there are indications that that could be done in the near future. It can be assumed that the Westinghouse Electric Corporation will then take whatever action is available to it to enforce the judgment. Whether a judgment of a foreign court is entitled to be recognised and enforced in Australia is, of course, a matter for Australian law. In general, two procedures for this are available: One is provided in the common law; the other is the subject of State and Territory legislation. At common law a foreign judgment cannot be directly enforced by execution but, subject to certain qualifications, it may be recognised and found an action which could result in a judgment able to be so enforced. For that purpose, there is no requirement of reciprocal rights in the foreign country in respect of Australian judgments. Under the State and Territory legislation certain classes of foreign judgments may be registered in the State or Territory and then directly enforced as if they were judgments of the local supreme court. However, with the exception of the South Australian legislation, the applicability of their provisions in relation to a judgment of a particular country is dependent on an order in council being made upon satisfaction that substantial reciprocity is assured from that country and that no such order in council has been made in respect of the United States of America. The South Australian legislation provides for the court of a foreign country to be proclaimed as a court of reciprocal jurisdiction, but such a proclamation is not essential to the operation of the legislation, which is based rather on the rules of private international law and comity. Whether at common law or under the State or Territory legislation, the recognition and enforcement rights for foreign judgments are not unlimited. For example, judgments in proceedings in which the foreign court did not have jurisdiction are not recognised; nor are judgments that are contrary to public policy or of a penal nature. It would, however, be unsatisfactory that the defendants to the Westinghouse treble damages judgment should have to rely on those grounds in order to resist enforcement of that judgment. By the action the Government has already taken under the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976, it has made clear its views that the Westinghouse proceedings are against our national interest. That being the position, it is desirable that legislative and executive action be taken which will leave no doubt that the judgment will not be recognised or enforced in Australia. Whilst the immediate need for the present Bill arises out of the default judgment the Westinghouse Electric Corporation has obtained, the Bill does not in terms refer to that judgment. As in the case of the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act, the Bill provides for the making by the Attorney-General of orders. Such orders are to be in respect of particular antitrust judgments, and before making an order the Attorney-General is to be satisfied that there has been inconsistency with international law or comity or that his action is desirable to protect the national interest. I inform the House that when the Bill has become law it is the intention of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to make an order in respect of the default judgment of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation to which I have referred and to do so on the ground that such action is desirable to protect the national interest. Any order that is made under the proposed legislation will have to be tabled and it will be subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament. On 14 September last year, in answer to a question by Senator Young, the Attorney-General reported on the outcome of certain consultations that had just been held in Washington with the United States Attorney-General and representatives of his Department concerning the extra-territorial application of antitrust laws. In the Attorney-General's answer he indicated that the consultations had covered civil as well as criminal proceedings and that he was looking forward with some optimism to the prospect of an agreement being reached within six months. That allowed for a period during which the heads of agreement on which the consultations took place could be considered in detail by the Department of Justice and other United States departments involved. The present position in relation to those consultations is that we are still awaiting the response of the United States authorities on the proposed heads of agreement. It is expected that a response will be received very soon. The response will not, however, render the present Bill unnecessary because the proposals we are exploring with the United States authorities will be applicable only in respect of future marketing arrangements. They will not be applicable to the Westinghouse proceedings. It is to be hoped that it will prove possible to obtain a better understanding with the United States authorities in relation to the enforcement of their antitrust laws. For its part, the Government will certainly be pursuing that objective. In the meantime, however, there is a clear need for us to take whatever steps are available to us to protect the Australian national interest. That is the essential purpose of the present Bill. I therefore commend the Bill to the House.","17"

"JXQ","I am pleased to support this Bill on behalf of the Opposition. However, I must say that the business people of Canberra will support it in the way that a poor man would accept crumbs from a rich man's table because that is about the effect it will have on the business people of Canberra. The raising of the exemption limit will in fact be very acceptable to small businesses. Businesses which pay wages or salaries of less than $1,250 a week will be exempt from payroll tax. I anticipate that this legislation will apply to many businesses which employ relatively small numbers of people- in the five to eight people bracket. I am sure that it will be very acceptable to a large number of businesses. I understand that something like 80 per cent of businesses in Canberra are what we would call small businesses and they will get some very marginal benefit from the Bill before us. In acknowledging this very marginal benefit I think it is only fair to point out to the House and to the public at large the very critical situation that has developed in Canberra. Some people and many members of Parliament are still unaware of the unemployment position and the position of business generally in Canberra. At the end of January Canberra had an unemployment rate of 9.6 per cent, which was the highest in the Commonwealth. I have no doubt that the rate is now over 10 per cent. This means in fact that about 8,000 people are unemployed in Canberra. The number of people unemployed in November 1975 was 2,000. So there has been a 400 per cent increase in the number of people unemployed since the end of the fateful days of the Labor Government. The most disturbing element in the latest unemployment figures is the massive increase in the number of unemployed adult males. This means that unemployment is biting quite deeply into the breadwinner section of the employment sector. In fact the figures show an increase of a little over 100 adult males in December. However, the number leapt up to 450 in January which is a massive increase. There was an unfortunate but expected increase in unemployed junior males and females for this period due to a seasonal factor. But the massive increase in adult male unemployment was unexpected and very deplorable. I am afraid the old growth rates of around 10 per cent are something of the past. The National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Capital Territory talk about continuing growth rates of two per cent or three per cent. However, I think even those growth rates are now at risk. The Government always talks about improvements to our major cities. However, measures to achieve this objective never quite eventuate. I believe that the employment situation will merely encourage people to leave Canberra and that the two per cent to three per cent growth rate could disappear altogether. We could finish up with a net loss of population in Canberra in the next few years. This would be a very dismal prospect for the business people here. It is interesting to quote from the debate that took place on this same topic in November 1976. My colleague, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem), made a very good speech. I do not think that he will mind me quoting what he had to say, although I think he ex: pressed these views as a pious hope rather than as an expectation. On that occasion he said:","17"
"JXQ","The honourable member for Canberra said that. I do not want to embarrass him but I know that he must be very disappointed that his expectations were not fulfilled. He made a very good speech at the time but, as I say, Canberra has gone bad. We have seen the sound economic planning that my colleague was talking about in the Australian Capital Territory reflected in Public Service staff ceilings, lack of employment opportunities for young people, departments left with inadequate staff to carry out essential functions and facilities to provide the amenities needed in Canberra. We have seen heavy cuts in the budget of the National Capital Development Commission which have completely wrecked the building industry. Businesses have gone broke. They have gone into liquidation. Tradesmen have left Canberra by the thousands. There have been massive rent increases which have resulted in about 500 empty residential units owned by the Government in Canberra at this time. During the last six months there have been between 400 and 500 empty flats. They have been empty not because people do not want them but because they cannot afford to pay the excessive rents which this Government has imposed on them in Canberra. That is the sort of good economic planning and management to which the honourable member for Canberra was looking forward. We have also seen the savage cuts in funds for loans supplied by the Commissioner for Housing. There have been gross distortions due to staff ceilings. I was told today that one worker was paid for 198 hours work in a two week period. That situation has been created by the staff ceilings. This took place in the Department of the Capital Territory. One man worked 21 days straight. He had his first weekend off recently since Christmas. In the Australian Capital Territory 8,000 people are out of work. This is a disgusting situation. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Ellicott) must take some responsibility for this position. People are required to do the work of two or three men while other people are out of work. We hear talk about inflation taking another man's job. In Canberra, staff ceilings take another man's job. They have grossly distorted the situation. I hope the Minister will look at the matter and do something about it. I can give him some more details on it if he is interested. There has also been a rash of liquidations in the business world. Many shops are empty. Only a couple of days ago one man had to move the stock from his two shops into one shop. He had to close down one shop because the overheads were too high and the turnover was not sufficient to keep two shops open. He had to consolidate and put off staff. The owners of small family businesses have been working extremely long hours and receiving no return just to keep the doors open. It is a pathetic situation. It is a disgrace for any government to have these sorts of conditions in the national capital of Australia. This Government has been quite unsympathetic and has done nothing to relieve the situation. Most of the time the Government does not even acknowledge that the position exists. I have checked around to see how businesses are doing. It seems to me that the only businesses that are thriving in the Australian Capital Territory—I do not know this from personal experience—are those associated with call girls, escort services and massage parlours. They are all doing very well and they are being advertised in Sydney. I do not know what this means. I know that it does not help the local people. It has been suggested that perhaps it reflects the great need for recreation under a government whose credibility is under great strain. They are the only businesses that are doing well in Canberra at the moment. Although this amending Bill gives some relief in respect of payroll tax, it must still be seen as an iniquitous burden on business. It is a tax on labour. It is a disincentive to employ people. It encourages the replacement of people by machines. It favours imports by increasing the cost of production. It discriminates against labour-intensive industries. Of course, the problem in the Australian Capital Territory is that payroll tax is of no benefit to the community because the money does not come back to the local administration. It goes into Consolidated Revenue. The States receive some benefit from payroll tax. The Australian Capital Territory does not except in a very indirect way. The tax serves to perpetuate this myth that Canberra people do not pay for themselves. Canberra people pay for themselves very well indeed. It is the Commonwealth which does not pay its way in Canberra because it does not pay payroll tax and land rates. People should acknowledge this fact. Indeed, the Government should acknowledge it. No direct benefit flows to Canberra from the collection of payroll tax in the Australian Capital Territory. The Opposition welcomes the introduction of this Bill because it provides slight relief to a very hard pressed business community. But it makes no significant contribution to resolving the very deep problems that affect business and the community in Canberra. The Government has been insensitive to our problems. It has not lifted a finger to relieve the situation. It has failed to supply adequate staff to the bureaucracy to carry out the important functions and responsibilities it has in Canberra. I can assure the House and the Government that it will take much more than a marginal adjustment to payroll tax for business people and the community at large to forget the shabby treatment they have received at the hands of this Government.","17"
"JSU","I think the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) made a fair effort of defending the indefensible, but I am afraid the defendant, that is the Government, will have to be found guilty and convicted just the same. What did the honourable member mean by some of the statements he made? He said that the Public Service had now been brought well under control. Just what on earth does that mean from a person who lives in a capital city which is controlled and has been developed by the Public Service? The Public Service is always under control. This Government may have a policy of reducing the Public Service or expanding the Public Service, but the system by which it develops is a tightly controlled one as any of us who have been in government can testify. Of course, what we heard from the honourable member was a fine exposure of the fallacy behind the economic policies of his Government. He was elected on the policy of reduction of the Public Service and reduction of public expenditure. They were two major features of the speeches and the policies of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)- or the caretaker Treasurer and the caretaker Prime Minister back in 1975. I cannot understand how every person in Canberra did not see that the present Government's policies were poison to Canberra. One could possibly sell those policies to people in Melbourne, but in Canberra the policies were the signposts of destruction and stagnation. That is the policy on which the honourable member was elected. What is the use of complaining now? I understand and have sympathy for his feelings for the people of Canberra. If this Government reduces public expenditure in Canberra and reduces the Public Service it does all of the things of which he complains. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron)—perhaps it was he who interjected a moment ago or he was just—waking up—and other honourable members might say: What do you mean by that?' The point that is being espoused is of course the theory behind the present Government's policies, which is that if one reduces expenditure in the public sector, the money one saves will be almost automatically transferred to some sort of economic dynamism in the private sector. Of course, that has not happened. In this city there has been a reduction not only in the Public Service but also a partial collapse in the private sector as well. It is a total exposure. I agree with the honourable member. It was a rather muted statement but he did say that the Public Service of Canberra is important to the welfare of Australia. I assert that emphatically. There is too much attack upon the Public Service and the public servant. There is too much criticism of the person who is called a bureaucrat in a derogatory sense. We have to refute that. I do not see any future for Australia unless we recognise that the public sector—I mean wider things than the Public Service in that term—is fundamental to the future economic health of Australia. There can be little expansion of the private sector unless it is initiated by the dynamics of the public sector. Canberra is a classic example of that. I know that that does not fall sweetly on the ears of honourable members opposite. They do not believe it. I know that many people do not believe it. But we have to examine that matter as thoroughly as possible.","17"
"10000","Order! The honourable member will address the Chair.","12","19"
"JSU","He says that it was. Good. Those representations must have floated to Sydney first. New South Wales introduced this measure first and we are doing it second. I think it is a very bad principle to lock ourselves in to another legislative body, even if it is one of the better ones in the country. That is not what we are about. This legislation represents two bad principles—a bad form of taxation and, as I call it, parliamentary puppetry. If somebody else makes a decision then the Government will follow. If somebody in Detroit makes a decision about motor cars we will follow. If the members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries make a decision about the price of oil we will follow. What kind of situation is that? I think that we should reject the principle, even if in this case there will be some benefit from the legislation. The general application of payroll tax to Canberra and the ACT is an infliction on the ACT of a piece of mythology—Canberra is too well off; the citizens here must be made to pay. This is not my belief but I am stating the kind of things which we have all heard over the years. It is said that if somebody else does something we ought to do it too. People ask how can people in Canberra be allowed to get away with something. If something is done in Victoria, South Australia or Queensland, in legislation which puts a tax on cheques, receipts, housing transfers—there is a multitude of these—it is said that this should be done in the ACT. It happened year after year before we came into government. I say, sotto voce, that we inflicted some of it ourselves. We followed. I think that is a totally bad principle. It is totally bad government. If witches started being burned in Queanbeyan it would not be long before we had a few before the stake in front of Parliament House. I think payroll tax ought to be abolished. It represents nearly everything that is incorrect about taxation principles. What do we get for it here? I understand that in Canberra payroll tax raises $16m a year. Much of this money will come from small businesses. It is true that in general principle the Commonwealth does not pay. But as I understand it those instrumentalities that for some mysterious reason belong to the Commonwealth but try to look as though they do not—or the Government tries to make it look as though they do not—such as the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority, are the biggest contributors to payroll tax. I am informed from a fairly reliable authority—I did not have time to pursue the matter to be sure—that this instrumentality of the Commonwealth Government as such has to pay payroll tax. It would be an interesting study to see how many such instrumentalities pay payroll tax. I know that this happens throughout other parts of Australia. This legislation is a piece of nonsense so far as it has effect in that regard. It is an Alice in Wonderland financial system. Even if the ACT Schools Authority is not paying payroll tax some of the other instrumentalities that get their funds from the Commonwealth are. So we magnify some of our own problems by the kind of taxation system we have. What does this payroll tax do? Firstly it creates cash difficulties for the small business. A business does not have to have many employees before it has to pay payroll tax. There are not many businesses around these days that have the kind of cash which enables them to afford to do as the honourable member suggested- he deplored it- subsidise the Government for a while or wait for the repayment of excess taxation payments. Payroll tax is a burden on all business. It is a particularly heavy burden on small business. It bears no relationship to profitability. It is totally inequitable and unjust and it is a bad taxation principle. As I read in one article, indirectly it discriminates against Australian manufacturers in favour of overseas manufacturers because overseas manufacturers probably do not pay that kind of tax and of course would have to pay tax on low incomes anyhow if they did. I think it is time that we examined the taxation structure of Australia from the beginning to end and recast the principles upon which we levy taxation. First of all, the ability to pay ought to be the principal consideration. We should ask: 'What is your ability to pay?' The ability to pay depends on one's income and one's general wealth. There are great difficulties connected with collecting wealth taxes. A person who owns a farm may sell it for $250,000 to buy another farm for $250,000. That person must pay tax on that suddenly acquired sum of $250,000. Obviously he cannot get back into business in the same strength. The same happens of course with the transfer of farms through inheritance and with businesses. It seems to me that it is time that we applied ourselves to this question of the transfer of wealth and at what point the tax ought to be levied and so on. That is the first point. The next point is that it is time we started to get rid of all nuisance taxes—taxes on cheques, taxes on sales, taxes on receipts and taxes on the transfer of houses, particularly at a time when people are short of money, down to their last dollar, and are being squeezed to try to meet the commitment on their houses. I think legislation was introduced in this Parliament—it originated in one of the States—to impose a tax on hire purchase agreements. If we do not use it in the Australian Capital Territory we certainly do it in some of the States. I think these are nuisance taxes. They are very unjust. They are inequitable. They are simply escape hatches for Treasurers to try to create the appearance that heavy taxes are not being imposed on the unlucky victims. Now, of course, there is the departure tax which has been generated I think by a standing committee of this House. If there is anything of greater nuisance value than that tax, I would like to meet it; somebody else can pay it, though. I recall what happened to the unhappy Charles I when he got around to imposing hearth taxes, ship money, window taxes and all the rest. His head was chopped off. I do not believe in capital punishment except perhaps for governments of the opposite persuasion. Capital punishment, of course, is defeat at the election ballot. I remind the House that unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory has risen to four times its level in 1975. Canberra relies absolutely on the Government. But the Government has deserted its responsibility to Canberra. The honourable member for Canberra said something about the economic situation in 1975. What was it? He mentioned the cost of houses. For instance, at a rough calculation on the figures he quoted, it took 160 to 170 weeks to buy a house from the average weekly earnings in 1972 and it took about the same number of weeks in 1975.","17"
"JSU","The honourable member can work out the taxes after that. The same principle applied to many other things. I have before me a schedule that I once worked out showing the number of loaves of bread one could buy and so on. I just happened to find it in my archives today as I was looking over material that I had produced to refute the things the honourable member opposite had said. I will not inflict them on the House tonight. But if one wanted to live off bread alone, in 1972 one could buy 372 2 lb loaves of bread with average weekly earnings. One could buy 420 loaves at the end of 1975, but at the end of 1977 we could buy only 374 loaves. The same principle applies to the number of weeks needed to buy the cheapest car on the market. We are not going to resolve the problems of the nation unless we first of all consider the economic implications of everything that we do. I believed in 1975 that it was totally wrong for people to pursue a policy of reducing the public sector. I believe that the public sector in Australia is fundamental to both the industrial base and the economic health of the country. I believe that the manufacturing sector cannot possibly take up all the people who are presently unemployed even if we stop all importing. The manufacturing sector has become almost totally automated in some areas and the number of employment opportunities available is diminishing. lt is the public sector which will supply the economic base for a full employment policy. That is an enormous challenge to Western societies. We have to find a new way of financing things. I do not know what the answer is but we will have to turn our minds in an inventive way rather than in a theoretically stagnant way as we are doing now. I remind the House of what my friend the honourable member for Fraser had to say about the happenings in this city since the honourable member opposite became the member for half of it. There has been a quadrupling of unemployment. There has been a collapse of the building industry. There are empty houses in Canberra, there has been a collapse of businesses and a rash of liquidations, to use that term. There has been much investment in unused facilities. I agree that it is better for them to be there now than to have to wait for them in years to come, but it is sad to see so much valuable investment unused in this city. There has been a destruction of the sense of security and purpose. I think this legislation is a very poor piece of legislation because it represents most of the errors of government and some of the sorts of philosophies that all of us have pursued at various times. I hope that, when we next get around to looking at the question of payroll tax, we will examine means by which we can abolish it altogether. I think altogether $1,600m has been collected in the States in payroll taxes. What that is doing to costs and what it is doing to small business is beyond any method of computation. Insofar as it is any use appealing to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on these matters, I hope that he will start to take the House into his confidence and place before it the opportunity in the future to abolish payroll tax altogether.","17"

"JXQ","The Opposition supports these two Bills because we think that whilst there is grave doubt that there will be any benefit for consumers resulting from their enactment, they do lead to a higher level of stability within the industry and are in the interests of producers. The Bills in themselves raise a number of serious questions with which I shall deal. The Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia levy with which the Bill is concerned is a levy which is collected to offset losses on exports of surplus production of eggs. If we had the well organised and well controlled industry that we have been trying to attain for many years there would not be a significant export surplus hanging around the neck of the industry because the surplus production which is sold for export is sold at a much lower rate of return than the domestic price. As is the custom with our primary industries, the Australian consumer has to pay extra to subsidise the export loss. This problem could be overcome of course if we could harmonise our production exactly to consumption. Unfortunately it is very difficult to do that with any agricultural products, including eggs. Of course there are times of the year when there is necessarily a surplus. The birds do not always harmonise their peaks of production with the peaks of demand by the Australian public. So at times there will be shortages and at other times there will be surpluses. Despite that, over the last few years the various State boards and State governments have been endeavouring to reduce the export loss by a system of licensing or hen quotas. If this system had been adhered to more rigidly and had not been subject to so much political pressure, the situation of production equalling domestic demand would have been reached much sooner. Unfortunately, that was not the case, and we have had an unnecessary surplus production for which the Australian consumer has had to pay and is continuing to pay. That is the contradiction in this Bill. The egg outlook is good on paper. It is said that production is likely to be down and that the exportable surplus also will be down. If we took only those factors into consideration there would be no need to increase the CEMAA levy, but what the Bill is doing is doubling the levy from $1 to $2 per bird. The Government said that that will be offset by the State boards reducing their pool charges. I hope that takes place because if it does the extra CEMAA levy will not be reflected in domestic prices. However, if the boards do not reduce their charges accordingly, the consumer will be paying more to offset the export loss. I am at a loss to understand why that should be so when the indications are that the percentage of the total product to be exported will be down and there are prospects that the return on exports may be increased. Most of the exports go to Japan. Some go to Iran but I do not know what the position will be in Iran this year. Australia may be a bit light on for export opportunities there. Nevertheless, the overall situation is that there will be a surplus, we will sell at a loss and the Australian public will have to pay for it in one way or another. That is not good news for the local consumers but it is good news for the producers. They support this Bill which will help to stabilise their industry. Other worrying features of the industry are the way in which hen quotas have become transferable and this inevitable process of having fewer farms, with the little producers going out of the industry, and more of the larger farms because of economies of scale. This is an inevitable process which applies in the poultry and other agricultural industries just as it applies in the manufacturing industries. Indeed, agricultural industries can be compared in many ways with the manufacturing industries. To give some indication of the change, in the last 10 years the percentage of farms with over 5,000 birds has increased from 3 per cent to 18 per cent. This has been the trend year after year. The big are getting bigger and the small are dropping out. They are able to transfer their quotas which have some considerable goodwill value, and we have heard of some quite fantastic prices being paid for hen quotas. I want to refer now to the second Bill which provides for the CEMAA levy to be refunded to producers in the Australian Capital Territory. This is very commendable, but I seek some clarification of precisely what it means because the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) in the second reading speech was not very clear about it. It should be understood that the Australian Capital Territory does not produce sufficient eggs to fulfil the local demand. Canberra has something like 150,000 hens but at least 200,000 are needed to meet the local demand. I think that this is a very unfair situation. The industry in the Australian Capital Territory does not contribute in any way to the export surplus and does not contribute to the loss, but it has to pay out the CEMAA levy. Over the years Canberra consumers have paid out something like $800,000 in CEMAA levies and there has been nothing received in return apart from the advantage of having a stabilised industry. I suppose that is fair enough, but as Canberra grows it is only fair that the quotas of local producers be increased so that they can meet the whole of the local demand. Unfortunately, a parochial attitude has been adopted by the State Ministers for Agriculture on the Australian Agricultural Council. They are the people who control the quotas and they have been quite bloody-minded about it. They have not given the Minister for the Capital Territory a fair go on the Council and they have stubbornly refused to increase the quotas of producers in the Australian Capital Territory so that they can dump their surplus eggs in Canberra. That is precisely what is happening. At the moment the Victorian Egg Board is selling eggs in Canberra. It has something like 20 per cent of the market. An injunction had to be taken out against the Board to stop it giving special discounts to retailers, but it is still selling eggs here at a lower price, with a lower return to producers in Victoria than it is selling them on the Victorian domestic market. The Victorian Board is dumping eggs in Canberra and it says that it would rather sell them here at a loss than put them in the export pool where it would lose more. This is a very unsatisfactory situation as far as Canberra is concerned. People here want fresh eggs, and if there are local producers who can sell them at a cheaper price than eggs which are handled through the State boards, they should be able to do so. The Bill provides for the levy to be refunded to Australian Capital Territory producers but it does not say whether that applies to the new levy or the whole levy. I understand that in the States the refund represents something like 75 per cent of the total levy. I should like the Minister to clarify that point to establish whether this levy is going to be refunded to the extent of 75 per cent because if it is the price to the consumer could be reduced. If it is not going to be refunded to that extent it means that the consumer in Canberra, as will consumers in other States, will have to pay more. I have made the point that Canberra producers have not had a fair go in relation to eggs. They do not want any favours. They want to be able to produce eggs and sell them to the people in Canberra. We do not want to be dependent on imports from the surpluses in the States, and the local producers do not want to contribute to the surplus. We want to meet the market and pay our way, and I think by the same token that the State Ministers for Agriculture should do their job to see that hen quotas are reduced to manageable levels so that the exportable surplus is reduced still further. If that happens, not only will the remaining producers benefit but also the consumers of Australia will cease having to pay 4c, 5c, or 10c a dozen extra in order to subsidise losses on surpluses exportable overseas. This is a situation which has been prevalent in many primary industries in Australia for many years. Fortunately, it is one problem with which the Government is now very belatedly coming to grips and trying to do something about.","17"
"10000","Order! The honourable member for Hotham will remain silent. I am in the chair and I will decide whether there is a point of order. I have not heard it yet. What is the point of order?","12"
"9F4","The honourable member who raised that point of order has collected the eggs on his coat and face during political rallies as the angered crowds have pelted him. I do not think he really knows that much about this subject. Whilst I have no intention of starting a revolt or a revolution over the imposition of the increase in this levy I do present the case on behalf of some of my egg producers that we should not simply sit by and watch some of these rural matters pass through the House unchallenged. Many a matter, particularly an increase of this size, will really serve to cause great hardship in the industry. I wonder in how many other industries or areas of production in this country the manufacturer or producer is levied to offset losses when products or manufactured items are sold at a loss price overseas or, in other words, are dumped- there is no other word for it. Surely no other industry is so affected. I conclude with a question. Why should those who produce eggs be so affected?","17"
"OD4","I think it is quite significant that I should follow the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) in this debate on the poultry industry because who above the honourable member for Fadden in this House would have more regard for a nest egg? He is not of the domestic type of fowl but of the cuckoo type, which has been known to value the golden eggs in someone else's nest, about which the Press has been able to tell us in the last couple of days. I thought the only knowledge he had of eggs was from the amount of egg he gets on his face on occasions. Before I launch into the Bills it is worth pointing out to those in the House or those who might be listening the almost total absence of National Country Party members from the House when we are debating an agricultural Bill. The important exception is the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite)—I would like that noted. The Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Adermann) is here also. Apart from them, National Country Party members are conspicuous by their absence. Where are the rest of them? If the House is debating a uranium Bill, if the dollar signs are ticking around, the National Country Party members are here en masse. But when we are debating an agricultural Bill—a Bill which will be to the benefit of the people whom the National Country Party members are supposed to represent, namely, the little farmers of Australia- where are the members of the once great National Country Party? They are out feathering their nests somewhere else while the responsible members of the Australian Labor Party from city electorates are here doing their best to support those farmers.","17"
"OD4","I do not know about that. Rising domestic prices for eggs are likely to account for an increase of 8 per cent on average unit returns to producers in 1978-79, whilst a reduction of the proportion of eggs available on the lower priced export market is likely to increase returns from this source as the eggs available will be sold on better priced markets. However, whilst the situation at present favours producers, the industry does face problems. We would like to be cognisant of them. Perhaps the major problem facing the poultry industry is the continuing decline in domestic egg consumption. Demand for eggs is influenced most greatly by population size and, with a declining population growth rate, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics predicts that consumption of commercially produced eggs this year will be only marginally above that of last year. To counter this trend, a $250,000 'hard sell'- I stress that it is 'hard sell' and not 'hard shell’ advertising campaign was announced in November last year to promote eggs and egg dishes in a similar way to the campaign undertaken by the dairy industry. It is to be hoped that the results for the poultry industry will be just as successful. Last night, when debating the Dairy Produce Sales Promotion Amendment Bill, I mentioned that the film Last Tango in Paris did wonders for the butter industry in Europe. I wonder whether we might introduce again on the commercial market the old film The Egg and I. That might do something similar for the poultry industry in Australia. But the future appears to augur somewhat better for poultry meat. The BAE expects poultry to consolidate its position as second to beef in the Australian meat diet because of higher beef prices. It predicts rather confidently that poultry consumption will rise by 9 per cent in 1979. This increase in consumption has been assisted by the growth of the fast food industry, a significant proportion of which is devoted to take-away chicken dishes. I am not going to give a free plug for Kentucky Fried Chicken, but obviously there being an outlet on almost every street corner has been a help to the industry. One very favourable indication of an upturn in the poultry industry and an example of an initiative which could be emulated by others in the industry was the announcement in December last year of the signing of a $6m contract by the Great Sincere Co. for the establishment of poultry farms in China. This project aims to emcompass the entire scope of poultry farming by supplying both buildings and breeding stock and will, I suggest, make a valuable contribution to the industry. Given development such as this and a favourable outlook for 1979, the poultry industry appears to be consolidating its position in the economy, and we are very pleased about that. The Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill seeks to increase the level of funds available for poultry research by raising the current limit of a maximum of $200,000 by 50 per cent to $300,000. The money allocated for poultry research is provided from a levy imposed on hens over six months of age in commercial flocks exceeding 20 birds. I have referred already to the current state of the poultry industry and to some of the problems which face it. Research into the industry is of vital importance in overcoming these problems. Research is a very practical tool with which to assist the industry. It produces solutions to problems which beset an industry and ultimately it makes that industry more efficient and profitable. For those reasons, the Opposition is very pleased to support the Bills.","17"
"0F4","I think the House should realise the limitations on the time allowed for debate on the Bills before us, namely, the Poultry Industry Levy Amendment Bill and the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill. I feel sure that I speak on behalf of my four colleagues from the National Country Party who are here and also on behalf of my colleagues who would have liked to have been here but are otherwise obligated. Certainly I would suggest that the National Country Party, along with other parties represented in this House, would want to see a viable poultry industry and a viable export market. Perhaps that is what the levy is all about. Like so many of our other exports, the export prices for poultry products are not what we would like them to be. This bears analogy with the recent recession that the beef industry went through but from which it is now picking up. The sugar industry recently went through a similar recession in which untied sales on export markets were certainly made at prices below the cost of production. The Bills we are debating tonight are the result of a resolution passed by the Australian Agricultural Council, comprising the State Ministers for Agriculture. Therefore, the legislation would have the blessing of all State Ministers. The various State Egg Marketing Boards and the Federal Council of Poultry Farmers Association of Australia would be in support of the legislation. However, I believe, as the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) said, that when we speak of an industry and of that industry's support for legislation we must speak also on behalf of the minority which is not advantaged by that legislation. Certainly that minority in the poultry industry is not advantaged by this legislation. The Bills seek to increase the levy from $1 to $2 per hen, the production of which is already fixed by quotas. Of course, depending on how and when this increase is applied, it will have the ability to double the expense of the levy in the hands of each domestic producer. In addition to this, the State egg marketing boards also charge a levy, and most of the egg producers of Australia are encompassed by these boards. The purpose of the levy charged federally, amongst other things, is to avoid the charging of a levy of a different amount by egg marketing boards in the States, which levy is then an incentive for a person on one side of a State border with a high levy to sell across the border in another State. Of course, this is authorised by the Constitution. The figures that are mentioned vary considerably but in the case of only two egg marketing boards is the levy any less than the levy of $1 per hen which the Commonwealth charges at the moment and which works out at about 6c per dozen eggs. The levy, of course, is meant to make up for costs and losses suffered by the boards over and above those losses suffered in respect of their own promotions and so on. It comes about really because of an excess production of eggs which then have to be pulped and sold at a consequent loss on what in the beef market might be called the dirty market. It is apparent from various representations that I and the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) have had that every producer is not in favour of this increase in the levy. In fact I would go further than that and say that quite a few of them are not in favour of the present $1 levy per hen, let alone any increase in it. The arrangement agreed to by the State Ministers needs Federal legislation to bind them. We are advised that any dispute between individuals within a State is the responsibility of the particular State Minister. I think that this is a little shortsighted. If we are going to legislate we should take into account the opinions of the persons who are in favour of the levy as well as those who are not in favour of it. As I said previously, the levy is to subsidise unprofitable exports to low priced markets and local producers are called upon to pay their share of something to which perhaps they do not contribute because the whole industry is regulated by quotas. As mentioned by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), the amending legislation puts particular emphasis on the Australian Capital Territory because of the difficulty being experienced here whereby, because of quotas, eggs are coming across the State line. I mentioned that there are people who dissent from this increase in the levy. I would say that producers in north Queensland, being outside an egg marketing board area, would be an example of such people. The particular reason that they are not in favour of it is that they are outside an egg marketing board area and produce only for the local market. In spite of their desire to produce more they are restricted by quotas and as a result many other eggs and egg products are coming in from the south. I want to take Mackay as an example. There are approximately four producers in Mackay and they are restricted by quotas. They supply approximately 28 per cent of Mackay 's needs. The balance is supplied from the south. Over the period prior to the implementation of quotas some producers went out of production. However, the remaining producers were not given the advantage of getting extra quotas equivalent to those which would have been forfeited by the old producers, although there was certainly a desire to expand and to take up what were then notional quotas. They were not allowed to do so. Whilst acknowledging that quotas are a necessary discipline on the whole industry, local producers feel that it is inequitable that, through quotas, they are denied the opportunity of supplying more of the local needs. They want to do so but they cannot. In fact through the levy they contribute apparently to the losses of boards which import the balance of the need into the area from the south. No doubt those losses cover freight charges of producers who are operating with quotas in excess of those necessary for similar local production. Being outside a board's jurisdiction, the local producers arrange for and meet all costs of their production, marketing and promotion on a local basis without any assistance from the present hen levy that they pay, which is now $1 per hen and will go to $2. They do all this at their own expense. The present levy is thus inequitable to those isolated people. Any increase beyond the $1 per hen will not only compound the inequity but also reduce them to marginal producers because they will share in an expense which could be doubled within a certain period of time. This fact will be well received in the south because if local producers go out of production, southern producers will be given a promise to supply extra northern markets as producers drop out and quotas to the local areas are lost. Encouragement must be given to local suppliers as this is the only avenue for the supply of top quality eggs to the local market. Consumers must benefit to the extent of the greater percentage produced locally because there is no freight cost to be included and the product is undoubtedly fresher and placed sooner in the consumers' hands. The north Queensland producers are not represented on any of the statutory boards. They have only one member on the Queensland Hen Quota Committee and apparently have no political representation to bring their own grievances and concerns to the notice of the authorities, mainly on a State basis. There is now a call for a pro rata reduction in the quotas and such a call will only compound the present inequity and allow a greater percentage access from the southern markets to the local markets. If the hen levy is to provide funds for losses created by egg boards through their own bureaucracies subsidising unprofitable exports and their own inefficiencies, producers outside board areas supplying only local needs should not be asked to contribute to other producers' inefficiencies and particularly board inefficiencies. The promise that State levies be used within States, whilst being preferable to the present national application of the levy, is useless unless written into legislation and unless the levy reimbursement be applicable to all producers and not just to those supplying boards, which is the case at the moment. I understand that any refund of the levy will not be paid to producers outside board areas. I see no evidence of this intention to use State levies within States or to pass any refunds on to all producers being written into the Poultry Industry Levy Amendment Bill. I would hope and recommend to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) that this protection be written in to the principal Act. It may extend refunds beyond the statutory boards to all producers. I would suggest that preferably in any legislation that might be amended in the future there be a provision that the producers I represent in the Mackay and the Dawson areas and through north Queensland be exempt from the levy because they are outside board control, or that perhaps exemptions be granted from the increase in the levy so that the injustice is not compounded. Whatever viability the industry in north Queensland presently has will be lost by any further imposition. I said that I do not speak for the majority of producers. I speak for the producers in my area and particularly those supplying local needs. They are only a minority but they certainly have a right to equity in this regard. I bring these matters to the attention of the Minister and the Department as very real and just complaints. In spite of that I feel that I must support the Bill because its purpose is to regulate a very vital rural industry in Australia. I ask that the matters I have raised be taken up quickly so that they can be adjusted on either a Federal or a State basis.","17"

"N/A","Last week I asked the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) a question as to when the Government was going to make a firm decision on the Industrial Assistance Commission's recommendation concerning tariffs on imported citrus juices. I put it to the House that any delay in this decision will affect the viability of the citrus industry, not only because it will delay decisions on the replacement of necessary machinery and fixtures but also the very level of production in future years. Citrus trees, after planting, take from 8 to 10 years to produce a satisfactory crop and the life of a tree is from 50 to 60 years. Therefore, if a grower wishes to maintain his level of production and thereby his viability, he must commit himself to expenses at the present time. Some honourable members in this House, after hearing the reply of the Minister for Primary Industry, might have wondered why some of the growers in my electorate are worrying about the level of the tariff. It is because Brazil supplies about 80 per cent of the orange juice on the world market and that the Brazilian price really controls the world price. This season the orange crop in Brazil has finished and been sold so there is not an over supply of juice available. So irrespective of the level of tariff at the present time it would not make any difference. I point out that next year Brazil expects to have a normal crop and Valencia orange juice will be available next season at about 13 cents to 14 cents a litre. The 65 per cent tariff will mean that growers will still only be paid about $90 per tonne for their fruit. This would allow the finished product of juice concentrate to remain competitive with that available to the chilled juice trade from overseas sources. With the Australian cost structure citrus juice cannot be produced under that cost. It must be remembered that the factory door fruit cost is only 34 per cent of the retail price and only 15 per cent of the retail price of orange juice drinks. I point out that it is not only the Australian citrus growers who are concerned about competition from this low cost and government subsidised Brazilian citrus juice. I refer the House to the Florida Citrus Industry Magazine of November 1978. Under the heading 'Tariff structure vital … to survival of Florida's citrus industry 'it is stated:","17"
"JVS","If we lost our tariff structure today, we'd lose an industry.","12"
"JVS","This is an article dealing with the problem of the importation of subsidised citrus juice from Brazil. It further states:","12"
"JVS","The primary concern of the Florida industry is, of course, Brazil; citrus men who have been in Brazil over the past several years say that the Brazilian citrus industry, heavily subsidised by its Government, is geared up to match Florida's production by the end of this century. Notwithstanding the fact that Florida processors have been using Brazilian juice as a pool to draw from in the past two seasons of short supply the South American country is obviously perfectly witling and ready to compete directly in the domestic market as well as abroad, should the price of Florida OJ go high enough to offset the cost of Brazilian concentrate plus the tariff, now 35 cents.","12"
"JVS","That figure relates to gallons and works out to 9 cents per litre of reconstituted Australian citrus juice. I want to point out to the House that the Government should give this matter serious consideration and bring in a system of floating quotas to take up the slack between the production of the Australian crop and imported juices.","12"
"0J4","I wish to bring to the notice of the House a matter of some importance concerning a publication circulating within my electorate. I believe that there is at this time an attempt being made to defraud householders and extract money from them in my electorate on the pretext of promising membership to a Discount Shoppers Club. The operation which has been brought to my attention goes under the name of Carlingford Discount Shopper, but I understand that it is also active in other Sydney suburbs including St Ives, Epping and Ryde. Householders receive a roneoed letter bearing the signature 'N. Phillips' advising them that by sending $ 10 to a Gordon post office box number within 14 days of their receiving the letter, they may become members of the club and eligible to purchase many items at discount prices. The club's ability to purchase at less than cost is explained as resulting from its ability to bulk buy due to its 4,000 strong membership. Householders are informed, and I quote from the brochure:","17"
"0J4","in 1978 club members collectively purchased $3m worth of supplies and saved over $1m.","4","6","17"
"0J4","It is implied in the pamphlet that Grace Bros Pty Ltd and Email Ltd are amongst the list of companies supplying goods. The fact, as I understand it, is that the only involvement these companies have had with the club has been to supply price details in a routine response to an inquiry. The New South Wales Department of Consumer Affairs is currently investigating Mr N. Phillips' activities and is advising anyone inquiring not to send money. I understand also that the Trade Practices Commission and the Fraud Squad in New South Wales are also considering investigation. I have brought the matter to the attention of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) tonight and he has promised to make a full and complete investigation into these serious matters. It would seem from information I have received that this is not the only dubious venture in which N. Phillips has been involved. In the 1976-77 report of the New South Wales Department of Consumer Affairs, N. Phillips was revealed as a proprietor, along with a Mr and Mrs Green of Green and Sons, of a building steam cleaning firm based at Wahroonga. The company claimed to have a revolutionary cleaning process for walls which would last for 20 years. Not only did the process not last the distance but also it caused deterioration of the walls in some cases. No satisfaction has been achieved from complaints and the Department has not been able to establish contact with the firm's proprietors. Again, only a post office box number was available. I understand that this unscrupulous operator may be behind a further distressing attempt to defraud using the name 'Old Windsor Enterprises', supposedly a personalised letter goods manufacturing firm. Calls have recently been made to bereaved families notifying them of orders for goods allegedly placed by the deceased. The caller apologises for the delay in delivery, but assures that the goods will be dispatched promptly upon receipt of payment and follows this up by sending a bill. Coming as it does at a time of distress and sadness this approach often results in the grieving family honouring the supposed debt. Naturally no goods are received. This obvious misuse of published death notices to deliberately defraud is diabolical. I would just like to alert honourable members to be vigilant in this matter. It may be that there are similar operators having in mind an operation within their electorate. Certainly in Sydney there are a number of honourable members who ought to be alerted to the possibility of a discount shopper named after one of their suburbs setting up operation. It is a matter to which they ought to be alert and in respect of which they should be willing to alert their constituents.","17"
"KJO","I rise in particular to make a reference to a great financial crash, but I am compelled, although time does not really permit me, to make some reference to the speech of the cliffhanging honourable member for St George (Mr Neil). Since the last State elections in New South Wales he has emerged as the great protector of the Greek community. Mr Deputy Speaker, even with your great learning you might not be aware of this fact. Following the last State elections in New South Wales, there was a tremendous swing in one part of the St George electorate. The honourable member for St George, being a cliffhanger, was so sensitive about this swing that he wrote to the Prime Minister to state that he had lost the Greek vote. Since then he has emerged as the great protector of the Greek community. Is it any wonder that the Government recently dropped the criminal charges against certain Greek people over their alleged frauds. It is another scandal. On Nationwide tonight we heard about the Beggs scandal involving the Fraser family. Every time there is a scandal or financial crash in Australia one has only to look at who are the pillars of or the backbone behind the organisation involved in that crash to see that, irrespective of what firm is involved, they are usually arch Liberals. Honourable members opposite may laugh. I refer to the crash of Patrick Partners, H. G. Palmer Pty Ltd, Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd, Latec Investments Ltd and the Testro Group. Always the backbone of the company in the crash are the pillars of the Liberal Party. Recently in the Associated Securities Ltd crash—the greatest financial crash in Australia's history—over $100m was defrauded from the shareholders. Who are the pillars of society involved in this crash? They are none other than the former Liberal Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry Bolte, Sir Reginald Ansett and Sir Cecil Looker, the former Chairman of the Melbourne Stock Exchange. I have always told my humble constituents of Hunter that there is no law for the rich and law for the poor; there is only administration of the law for the rich and the law for the poor. We should be reminded also that, in the crash of the H. G. Palmer organisation, the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Co. Ltd recommended that people invest in H. G. Palmer. One person who received advice to invest in H. G. Palmer was one of Australia's most brilliant and eminent Queen's Counsel, Mr Clive Evatt. After his savings were defrauded in the H. G. Palmer crash on the recommendation of the MLC, he went to court to get justice in Australia. But the Australian courts being so politically orientated, he could not get a verdict in his favour. So he went to the Privy Council in England. Honourable members opposite may laugh. He got a verdict for $110,000 against H. G. Palmer. One would expect that the honourable member for St George, a barrister, should be making the speech that I am making. The New South Wales Attorney-General, Mr Walker, is the only person who has advised investors in ASL—of which many were employees of Sir Reginald Ansett who advised his employees to invest in ASL—that they should seek legal advice with a view to getting legal justice as Clive Evatt did.","17"

"LE4","I draw the attention of the House to the front page of the Illawarra Mercury of today's date, which circulates in my electorate- at both ends of my electorate. The Australian Labor Party has suspended for 12 months, says the newspaper, a Shellharbour party member for alleged activities associated with the Communist Party. The suspended member is Mrs Beverley Fleet, secretary of the Cunningham Federal Electorate Council and the Treasurer of the Shellharbour branch. The Labor Party's administrative committee has informed senior ALP officials in the Shellharbour area- which is within my electorate by the way- of the decision to suspend Mrs Fleet. Supporters of Mrs Fleet are believed to be circulating a petition which seeks her reinstatement. I submit to this House very strongly that Labor members of Parliament, in particular the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) in this House and the honourable member for Illawarra in the New South Wales House, should state exactly where they stand in the Shellharbour dispute over communist association. In view of the widespread suggestions that the honourable member for Cunningham and Mr Peterson, the honourable member for Illawarra, have signed a petition seeking Mrs Fleet's reinstatement in the Labor Party the voting public in the area has a right to know whether these two parliamentarians condone this involvement of a senior Labor Party official with the Communist Party. I have no desire to become involved in internal Labor Party disagreements and have avoided commenting whatsoever on the longstanding battles within the Labor Party in the Shellharbour branch. However, the situation is no longer an internal one when members of parliament become involved in activities which fly in the face of the stated Labor Party policy on which they were elected by the people of the area. The Labor Party properly has dissociated itself from involvement with communists and I have always believed it wrong for Liberal politicians to 'kick the communist can' with respect to the Labor Party. But if Labor members of Parliament are supporters of a senior Labor Party official who has been found guilty by that party of distributing copies of the Communist Party newspaper, Tribune, at ALP meetings, of marching with communists during May Day celebrations and successfully moving a motion for a Labor branch to make a donation to an appeal to send a young communist to a Cuba conference, it appears that they do not support the Labor Party rule prohibiting any member from associating with the Communist Party. Voters in the area must be told whether these two Labor MPs are in favour of allowing the sort of association with the Communist Party of which Mrs Fleet has been found guilty. Overall, I regret to see the evident swing to the extreme left that appears to be taking place in some Labor branches in the area. The problems in the Shellharbour branch are now being followed by the sacking of the Dapto branch secretary—Dapto is also in my electorate—who has also pulled out of the Labor preselection battle to become the unsuccessful candidate for Macarthur at the next Federal election.","17"
