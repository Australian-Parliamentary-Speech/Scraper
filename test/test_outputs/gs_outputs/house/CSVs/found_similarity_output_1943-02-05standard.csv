"F4U","The speeches made by honorable members opposite on this bill clearly indicate that they are endeavouring to exploit the measure for party political reasons. We heard from the right honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) yesterday a typically flippant and satirical speech. He gave us a delightful exhibition of oratorical gymnastics. His remarks were entertaining and destructive, but by no means constructive, and any one not having a knowledge of past history would have classed him as a heaven-sent statesman straining to rectify all anomalies. He set out to ridicule the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin); but, despite that attack, all honorable members will admit that the right honorable member for Fremantle will be regarded by future historians as the most successful Prime Minister of this war period. His achievements will be in marked contrast to the negative and impotent policy of the Government led by the right honorable member for Kooyong. I remind that right honorable gentleman and other critics of the Prime Minister that, some of the most conservative newspapers in Australia impartially assessed the worth of the Menzies Government to this country in the war period. The Sydney Morning Herald, one of the most reliable conservative newspapers in Australia, said -","17"
"F4U","The mass of electors would feel more confidence in Mr. Menzies as a leader, if they were convinced - and they by no means are convinced - that he means to place national needs before party exigencies. The country is by no means satisfied that the Menzies' Government possesses either the vigour or efficiency which is needed to carry our war effort into top gear. For one thing, there lias been far too much wrangling and indecision within Cabinet itself. ... If the confidence of the country is to be securely held, the stamp of mediocrity upon the Ministry's general complexion and character must be removed. ... It has been a year of delays, a lack of policy, and of repeated shirking of responsibility.","17"
"F4U","I ask honorable members to contrast that opinion with that expressed by the impartial General MacArthur, supreme commander of the allied forces in the Southwest Pacific Area. After a year of administration by the present Government, he said -","17"
"F4U","I consider that General MacArthur's opinion can be accepted, because nobody is more closely in touch with the war effort in this area, and there is no man whose responsibilities bring him more directly into contact with the Prime Minister and the War Cabinet. The Prime Minister has been criticized for having sought the approval of the organized Labour movement before submitting this, bill to Parliament, but I contend that he acted within his rights and showed courage and statesmanship. He was amply justified in the action he took. He took his political life in his hands, because he considered that the passage of this measure was necessary for the security of Australia. At a later date the Prime Minister saw his proposals carried at an interstate conference of the Australian Labour party by a two-to-one majority. Those proposals are now the policy of the party. There was no difference between the proposals which the right honorable gentleman put before the Federal Executive of the Labour party in November and those which he submitted to the Australian Labour conference in January, despite the view expressed yesterday by the right honorable member for Kooyong. The Prime Minister's proposals are entirely different from those put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) last year. The Leader of the Opposition asked for total conscription for overseas service in any part of the world, and I opposed that. As Minister for the Army, I am convinced that the Prime Minister has gone far enough in this matter, and that there is no justification for unlimited conscription, as advocated by the Opposition. In consulting the Federal Executive of the Labour party, the Prime Minister did exactly -what would have been, done by the Leader of the Opposition, had he been in office and faced with a similar problem. The Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues know full well that when they were in office, they did not submit any important proposals to Parliament without the prior approval of the consultative council of the United Australia party.","17"
"F4U","The proposals contained in the bill have been subject to criticism both from those who desire unlimited conscription for overseas service, and from those who object to employment of the Citizen Forces outside Australian territorial limits. I say without hesitation that either critics of this measure speak without full, knowledge of the facts upon which they base their arguments, or their opposition to the measure is actuated by the desire to make political propaganda out of the military necessities of the Commonwealth. In this connexion I draw attention to the despicable nature of some of the statements appearing in the press. Much of this matter conveys to the public an impression that if the Government's proposals, as set out in this bill, were carried into effect no Australian troops would be available for the rescue of our men who are now prisoners of war in Malaya. The honorable member for Darwin (Sir George Bell) made a similar statement yesterday afternoon. Such propaganda is false. Its authors know it to be false, for they are aware that the Australian Imperial Force, having fought in almost every theatre of war in which British troops have been engaged, was, and is still, in its rapidly increasing numbers, available for service in any part of the world in which its services may, in the opinion of the Government, be required. No limitation whatever is imposed. It is most unfair, and indeed despicable, to try to make the relatives of our prisoners of war in Malaya believe that, if this measure be passed into law in its present form, no Australian soldiers will be sent .to Malaya, if necessary, to rescue them. In their anxiety to defame this Government the authors of this propaganda are damaging the Allied war effort, and prejudicing the Commonwealth in the councils of our Allies. Such propaganda, moreover, must exert a depressing influence most damaging to the morale of those of our men unfortunate enough to have been taken prisoner, to whom it will assuredly be repeated by their Japanese1 captors'. I say plainly, and without equivocation, that the authors of such statements are mot doing1 a. service to their country. The fact is that the Australian Imperial Force always has been, and under this measure still will be, available for service anywhere in the world. Moreover1 - and this is a fact which I wash to impress upon all members of the House, and upon members of the Opposition in particular - the Australian Imperial Force to-day considerably exceeds in number the combined strength of the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia Forces on full-time duty at the time this Government came into office. The members of the Opposition, for purposes of political propaganda, attack this Government because it does not propose a full merger of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces. I remind them that they were in office from September, 1939, until September, 1941, and during those two years they repeatedly pledged themselves not to introduce conscription for overseas service. They now attack this Government for not doing what they themselves would not do, and, in justification of their attack, they say that there was no danger of attack from Japan during their term of office. I ask the members of the Opposition, and particularly the right honorable member for Kooyong, three questions. The first is: Were they not aware of the danger of attack, from Japan when they were in office? The right honorable member for Kooyong said yesterday that no one but a child could have failed to foresee in 1939, that the world would be thrown into war. If it was so obvious surely it was clear to the then Government that Australia was in imminent danger of attack by Japan. The other two questions which I submit are: Did members of the Opposition not know that such attack, when, it came, would be launched without warning? Did they not know that, up to the time they went out of office, not one division in Australia was fully equipped to fighting standard? If members of the Opposition cannot answer the first two of these questions in the affirmative they must confess to a lack of understanding of the grave danger which confronted this com- paratively defenceless country. It ill becomes the right honorable member for Kooyong to belittle the efforts of the Prime Minister, who has done more to organize Australia for a top-gear war effort than has any other mau in Australia. The answer to the third question was. I think, given at a secret meeting of Parliament by the honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender), then Minister for the Army, in September, 1941. It is not necessary for me to elaborate what he said. It is well known to all honorable members. In the early months of that year he had fully informed his Cabinet colleagues of the condition of the Array, and he had unsuccessfully endeavoured to shatter their somnolent complacency. Did they' do anything constructive and practical to improve the position? No, they quarrelled among themselves. They told Parliament that the country was making the maximum war effort, whereas in fact the country was 50 per cent, below its potential in regard to the personnel of the armed forces, and also in regard to equipment and munitions of war. The last government was tragically satisfied with its war effort, and Ministers resented any attempt to shake them out of their complacency. While Australia lay virtually defenceless, the last government did not then talk about merging the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia.. It did not even attempt to call up for training in the Militia all the men available^ or to speed up the manufacture of equipment. Instead of taking effective action to improve the defences of the country the men who now lead the Opposition babbled about Australia's IGO per cent, war effort, although they knew only too well that the man-power and productive resources of Australia were not being employed to more than 50 per cent, of their capacity, and they stil had for their slogan ' Business as usual '. When the right honorable member for Kooyong returned from England, he made a series of fine speeches beginning at Auckland and carrying on in Sydney and1 later in this Parliament. Although he bacl been in office then for two years,, he made it evident in those speeches that he was only then beginning to think in terms of a 100. per cent. war effort. He told the people what, in his opinion, Australia's war effort should be. He made fine speeches, but his intentions were words only. The schemes which he outlined were never put into effect. It is true that he appointed certain men to high-sounding positions in his Cabinet. This was merely window-dressing. The outward show was good, but inwardly there was delay and further procrastination. He created some new portfolios, but the new machinery which he created remained inactive and ineffective until the advent of the Curtin Government. From the outbreak of the war members of the present Opposition have never ceased to stress the need for total war, by which they mean conscription for service in any part of the world. They were never prepared to do anything which might affect the privilegesor profits of their supporters outside Parliament. It is time that evidence of the complete incapacity of the Opposition to conduct the affairs of the country in time of war was revealed to the public. As I have said, the members of the last Government, instead of organizing Australia's defences, merely fought amongst themselves. We, as an opposition, did not defeat them. They quarrelled and split into warring fragments, because there was no effective leadership. In the present Government there is honest, courageous leadership and wholehearted co-operation with Mr. Curtin in the gigantic task with which he is confronted. I propose now to give to the House some particulars regarding the appalling position of Australia's defences when this Government took office. I have already said that Australian industry was then working at. only 50 per cent. of its present capacity of war production, and that the Army was less than half as strong in numbers as it is to-day. Here are some additional facts - There was not one modern fighter aero plane in the Commonwealth. You could count on one hand the number of tanks we had when the Menzies Government was in office. We now have hundreds of each of the best types of imported tanks and a growingnumber of Australian tanks as good as any yet produced in England or America. We had only about fifteen rounds of anti-tank ammunition per gun. We had less than one week's supply of field artillery ammunition for fight ing on a very moderate scale. We had only about 60 per cent. of the rifles required toequip our forces. We had only about 20 per cent. of the number of light automatic tommy guns required, and there was a very serious shortage of the machine guns we needed, with hopelessly inade quate supplies of spare parts. We had had in this country for many years a large number of . 310 calibre cadet rifles which this Government issued to the Volunteer Defenee Corps, but when we took office there was no ammunition whatever in Australia for them. One of the most urgent problems facing this country was the creation of reserves of petrol and fuel oil. During the whole of the two years that it was in office, the last Government stood idly by and watched our petrol reserves dwindling from week to week until, when this Government took office, they had reached a perilously low level. These are only a few examples which indicate the Opposition's complete incapacity to conduct the affairs of this nation in war-time. I cite them because each and every one of these deficiencies was occasioned by the sheer neglect of the government of the day to look into the future and provide the most elementary requirements of our defence forces. Had appropriate and energetic steps been taken by the Menzies Government upon the outbreak of wa r every one of these deficiencies could have been remedied before this Government took office.So much for the Opposition's preparations for the defence of Australia. I shall now give an example of their callous neglect of the Australian. Imperial Force. On pages 30, 31, 32 and33 of the book Active Service published at Christmas, 1941, and dealing with the Australian Imperial Force in the Middle East, an article on the retreat from Bengazi states -","17"
"F4U","I have given only a few of the many examples of neglect which I could cite, but the knowledge of those should be sufficient to make the public resolve to keep the Opposition out of power for ever. The best thing that ever happened to Australia was the defeat of the Fadden Government and the appointment of the right honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Curtin) as Prime Minister. The drive and enthusiasm which He imported into Australia's war effort has made it possible for us to fashion the mightiestarmy that has ever been assembled in the southern hemisphere. The Government has been able, not only to ensure the security of Australia, hut also to place us in a position in which we can help our allies in the bold offensive that will be necessary in order to defeat the enemy. The Australian Imperial Force to-day is sufficiently well equipped to meet any enemy on equal terms, and the same can be said of the Citizen Military Forces. The whole Australian Army to-day - in Australia and abroad - is equipped as well as, and possibly better than, any enemy forces it may be called upon to encounter, and as a result the Commonwealth to-day is in a position incomparably stronger than when the Opposition was in office. In deciding the need for the measure now before the House, the Government was not concerned with whether or not the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces should be merged, nor did it consider whether or not the Militia should be kept on Australian soil. It took into consideration only one factor - the most effective use of the Australian Army in the prosecution of the war in 'the South-west Pacific. The Government came to the conclusion that that objective would be achieved by the adoption of the measure now presented to the House. I remind honorable members of this House that the overwhelming majority of the male population medically fit and available for service in the armed forces are already serving in those forces. Practically all the medically fit men not serving have been exempt from service by reason of their employment in reserved occupations. There are in addition some youths who have not yet reached military age. A large proportion of the men employed in reserved occupations have, in the past, desired to enlist in the fighting forces, but have been debarred from doing so by reason of the nature of their employment. Active measures are now in progress to release as many as possible of these men for military service, and there is every reason to believe that when released 'they, and the youths now coming of military 'age, will volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force as freely as have others of the male population. I shall now deal with the position of serving Army personnel. Security reasons prevent the disclosure of the number of the Citizen Military Forces personnel who have volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force, but I can now inform honorable members of this House - and I think the people should know it as well - that the number of Citizen Military Forces personnel who have, since June last, volnteered for the Australian Imperial Force is equal to the number of Citizen, Military Forces on full-time duty when this Government took office. I want to emphasize the important fact, not previously known to honorable members, that more than 70 per cent, of the men of Australia's fighting forces who are medically fit for combat service overseas have volunteered for such overseas service, and are available for use in the allied cause in any part of the world. That is a record of which Australia can be proud. There is every reason to believe that this percentage will be increased substantially, because applications for transfer from the Citizen Military Forces to the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force have been coming in at a steady rate during the last six months or more and show no signs of diminishing. There was no sudden rush to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force when the Government's intention to introduce this bill was announced, nor is there any reason to expect a decline of the number of applications in the near future. Figures indicate that enlistments in, and transfers to, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force have maintained- a steady flow, with occasional fluctuations, from several months prior to this Government taking office up to the present time. Therefore, there is little doubt that this process will continue and that many militiamen who, for their own reasons, have not yet transferred to the Australian Imperial Force will do so in their own good time. The present monthly rate of transfers appears likely to continue, resulting in a steady increase of the percentage of our medically fit personnel volunteering for service in the Australian Imperial Force. I have already pointed out that the number of members of .the Citizen Military Forces who have volunteered for service in the Australian Imperial Force is equal to the entire strength of the Citizen Military Forces on full-time duty when this Government took office. A large proportion of those who have not yet transferred are men who have been called up in recent months and have family responsibilities to clear up before they can consider transferring to the Australian Imperial Force. In addition, a considerable proportion of those who have not yet volunteered consists of boys under twenty years of age whom many honorable members have been rightly anxious to keep out of the front line in New Guinea, but whom Opposition members, who formerly were so solicitous for their welfare, now appear to be anxious to send into the front line outside Australian territories, and outside the South-western Pacific Zone. I wish to make it perfectly clear that present members of the Citizen Military Forces are volunteering for the Australian Imperial Force as freely as did their predecessors and that there is a steady stream of transfers. It is important that Australia and the world at large should realize that more than 70 per cent, of the members of Australia's fighting forces who are medically fit have volunteered already for service anywhere in the world, and that more are volunteering every week. Can any other country claim such a record of voluntary enlistments? These figures show how baseless is the charge that our soldiers cannot be sent to Malaya to rescue Australian prisoners of war there. Not only have the majority of them volunteered for world-wide service, but also it is almost certain that during this war most of them will be required to serve beyond the area defined in this measure should the strategic considerations require such action. They are available for service wherever considered necessary by the Government on the recommendation of its military advisers. I have no doubt that with the steady flow of transfers from the Citizen Military Forces, the release of more men from reserved occupations, and the call-up of youths attaining military age, the percentage of our medically fit man-power serving with the Australian Imperial Force will be maintained, or even increased substantially. There is every reason to believe that new recruits will volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force as freely as their predecessors have done. I say deliberately that no other allied country, with the .possible exception of New Zealand, will send so large a proportion of its medically fit and available manpower to fight outside its own territories. It would be a physical impossibility for the United States of America to do so because the facilities are not and never will be available to transport 70 per cent, of America's medically fit fighting men beyond American territorial limits. Honorable members will know or can ascertain easily, the approximate number of men that would be involved in such a move. The impossibility of the task of providing transport is obvious. The United Kingdom is in a slightly different position. Alone, its transport problem would not be so great as that of the United States of America, but considered in conjunction with the requirements of its allies, it appears most improbable that Great Britain would be able to send 70 per cent, of its medically fit fighting personnel outside the United Kingdom, even if there were no necessity to retain a large force to meet a possible invasion. Britain will be compelled to maintain that defensive force until Germany is so badly smashed that it is beyond the power of that nation to attempt an invasion, of the United Kingdom, and by that time the war will virtually have been won. It is suggested frequently that the existence of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces as separate forces impairs the efficiency of our Army as a whole. I deny emphatically that that is so, and I take this opportunity to emphasize that within the South-western Pacific Zone we have one army under one control. General MacArthur is Commander-in-Chief, South-west Pacific Area, and General Blainey commands the Allied land forces in that area. His army is one army, including the Australian Imperial Force, the Citizen Military Forces, and the United States Forces. The efficiency of this composite army is impaired in no way by the inclusion of any of the units of which it is composed, and any one who suggests that that is not so is actuated only by party political considerations. To-day Australia is more exposed to attack than any other part of the Empire.","17"
"F4U","I believe that to be so. We are in constant danger of attack, and any person who underestimates the Japanese is doing a great disservice to Australia. The Japanese have suffered some small setbacks, but their population numbers 80,000,000 and they have a further 20,000,000 people under their domination. They are preparing for the day when they will strike back. The areas that they have lost are very small, and I have no doubt that they will endeavour at. the earliest opportunity to recapture them. When one considers how they have spread their tentacles across the South-west Pacific, it is obvious that although they have been pushed back at certain points, they will come again. Any one who lulls himself into a sense of complacency by the belief that we shall receive no more shocks from the Japanese is, knowingly or unknowingly, doing a great disservice to this country. As a member of the Advisory War Council and of War Cabinet I can assure all members that we are in constant danger of further attack. It must be remembered tha-t Australia is a long way from centres of allied population. In order to make our maximum contribution to the allied cause, to minimize demands upon allied shipping, and to use our fighting forces with the fullest effect, Australia must envisage the maximum use of its troops in the areas most accessible to them, Both inside and outside the South-western Pacific Zone. The passage of this bill will enable this . to be done. Our proximity to the Pacific front lines calls upon us inevitably for a greater proportion of our man-power than that which any of our allies, with the possible exception of New Zealand, can possibly contribute to the common cause. If the demands be greater upon us than upon our allies we must remember also that our peril is greater and therefore we must put forward a greater effort to save ourselves. I emphasize that in making the Australian Imperial Force available for world-wide service, Australia is contributing to the allien cause a proportion of its man-power greater than that which any other allied country, with the exception of New Zealand, can possibly send outside its own territory. In addition to the Australian Imperial Force, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy we are also contributing the Citizen Military Forces for service within the area that is most vital to the defence of the Commonwealth, namely, the South-western Pacific Zone, outlined by the Prime Minister. Nobody will question that it is preferable in every respect to defend Australia in the adjacent islands rather than to allow the Japanese to land in this country and fight on Australian soil. Our national peril demands the most effective use of all our forces, and that necessitates all our forces being made available for use in the South-western Pacific Zone. That is apparent from an elementary analysis of the position. Members of the Australian Imperial Force are all front-line troops, and can be most effectively used in the front, line. Our citizen forces include a proportion of troops fit for frontline service and a proportion, who although not fit for the front line, are capable of carrying out useful work on lines of communicatioin. Members of our citizen forces who are fit for frontline service can be used most effectively in the front line in areas, that are within the ambit of the provisions of this bill-. This measure makes these men available for service in the South-western Pacific Zone which will be Australia's front line for a long time to come. As the allied forces advance and reconquer enemy-occupied territory our lines of communication will extend to those territories, and the demand for men for service on lines of communication duties will increase correspondingly. For that purpose this bill will make available military personnel who, although unfit for the front line, can operate efficiently on lines of communication. Every advance into enemyoccupied territory will increase the demand not only for lines of communication personnel, but also for troops capable of undertaking front-line service to hold the territory gained and to repel any counterattacks which may be launched, because it must be remembered that our task consists not only of recapturing enemy occupied territory but also of holding it when it is recaptured. Does any honorable member believe that victory in the South-west Pacific can be purchased cheaply? I say plainly and without hesitation that our militia forces will not be sufficiently numerous for the work required of them in the South-western Pacific Zone, and that if and when the Australian Imperial Force proceeds beyond that zone our manpower resources will be so depleted that we shall be obliged to secure the further assistance of allied personnel to help hold the reconquered territory. Obviously it is a physical impossibility for any country to send all its military forces outside its own territory. Remembering that when honorable members opposite occupied the. treasury bench they repeatedly pledged themselves not to extend the area in which our citizen forces could be used beyond Australian territories, and knowing that the despatch overseas of all Australia's military forces would be a physical impossibility as well as strategically unwise, why does the Opposition demand that thisGovernment shall do what they themselves refused to do and what they kno w to be impossible?","17"
"F4U","The Australian Imperial Force is numerically stronger than the Militia in Australia to-day. The Opposition, apparently, lost sight of that fact. After hearing them one would think that we had only a few thousand men in the Australian Imperial Force and the remainder in the Militia, but not allowed to go outside Australia.","17"
"KNX","All that the Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde) has said is, no doubt, very interesting, but it would be much more impressive to honorable members on this side did we not know that the Minister has a hard job to square the statements which he has just made with those that have been made on other occasions by the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin). I strongly suspected that, while the Minister was appealing to honorable members not to indulge in party politics with regard to this proposal, he was speaking with his tongue in his cheek. His whole speech savoured- of party politics. Therefore, before I deal with the bill itself, I shall correct some of his statements. He took to task the Government of which I was a member with regard to its war effort. In effect, he said no good could come out of Israel; that what we had done was of no moment, that we had made a complete mess of the whole show, and that honorable members opposite, as the saviours of this country, had assumed office in the very nick of time. I point out that the Minister, when in Opposition, was a member of the Advisory War Council. I ask the House not to forget that. As a member of that body, he, and his colleagues as well, must have known the exact state of affairs at that time. With that knowledge, he subscribed to what had been done by the previous Government. On the 28th May, 1941, the Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, declared in this House -","17"
"KNX","That was when the present Government members were in Opposition, and we formed the Government, which the Minister now seeks to deride. The Prime Minister continued -","17"
"KNX","The Prime Minister added that munitions production and the development of production capacity over a wide range of classes, including aircraft, was growing weekly. Who is telling the correct story - the Prime Minister or the Minister for the Army? Does it not appear that the statements just made by the Minister have been made purely for party political purposes? Let us examine his speech a little more closely. In his opening remarks he said that there was no justification for unlimited conscription. That is a definite statement.","17"
"KNX","The Minister now says, ' unlimited ' conscription for overseas service. I should like to explain to the House that on the 27th October, about three weeks before the Prime Minister approached the conference of the Labour party, the Minister said -","17"
"F4U","For the unlimited conscription which honorable members opposite advocate.","3","4"
"KNX","No; I ask the House to note the difference. The Minister, in his opening remarks to-day, said there was no justification for unlimited conscription. But on 27th October last he said, ' There is neither justification nor necessity for conscription'; he did not say ' unlimited ' conscription. However, as he has now learned of the decision of the Labour conference, he qualifies that statement by saying ' unlimited ' conscription. Therefore, it ill-behoves the Minister to criticize the right honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) as he has done. He said that the right honorable member for Kooyong was aware of the extraordinary conditions existing in Japan, and that the Japanese would strike without warning. The Minister himself, however, made his own statement after Japan had actually struck at Australia. He declared that, although the right honorable member for Kooyong knew that Japan would strike without warning, he took no step to introduce conscription. Yet, after Japan had actually struck at us, the Minister himself said that there was no justification or necessity for conscription for overseas service. In this matter the Minister, like his colleagues, has retreated from position to position in order to adapt himself nicely to party political developments. Dealing with the bill itself, I shall give some indication of the reason for its introduction. It shows a lack of appreciation of our real position. The Minister, in his speech, delved into history. The right honorable member for Kooyong followed a similar course, but with different results. We might, with satisfaction, look 'a little more closely into history in order to discover the real reason for this measure. Before historians will accept the right honorable gentleman as being the greatest Australian Prime Minister to date, they will weigh his insistence on the limited use of the Citizen Military Forces against this country's obligations to its allies. History will not spare the Prime Minister as honorable members have spared him this week. The origin of the legislation lies in certain undertakings that the Prime Minister gave to General MacArthur. The right honorable gentleman said that any action which had to be taken would not be allowed to wait upon debate, and that if General MacArthur asked for certain things to be done, they would be done without delay due to political considerations. The people welcomed that broad and bold declaration. They congratulated themselves on having at last discovered a man worthy to be Prime Minister. But what happened? Immemediately General MacArthur, who accepted the Prime Minister's statement at its face value, made a request, the Prime Minister sought from the Federal Executive of the Labour party permission to make it the law of the country. Ignoring the Parliament of the Commonwealth, this leader of a democratic party appeared as a mere delegate at the conference of the Labour party and appealed te men, who had no knowledge or appreciation of the position, to consent to the introduction of this legislation. Had the right, honorable gentleman forgotten his assurance to General MacArthur that action would be taken without heed of political considerations? General MacArthur believed that the assurance would be honoured, but he did not know the Labour party. However, the Prime Minister had committed himself, and he was hi a cleft stick. He knew the hostility of the Labour party to conscription, and he was compelled to do something. The Prime Minister's reluctance to act will be appreciated when I quote from a manifesto written in 1916 by John Curtin, and entitled Australian Trades Union Anti-Conscription Con.gress - The One-Day Stop-Work Meeting. Doubtless, some honorable members have read the article, for it was reprinted in the Century newspaper on the loth January last. Some of the most interesting paragraphs are -","17"
"KNX","Those sentences excellently interpret the Labour party's attitude to conscription. J'u another part of the article, the author stated! -","17"
"KNX","I have no doubt that the honorable member for Melbourne has espoused that view and that he will applaud those statements. He is not alone in that regard. A few nights ago, the honorable member for Lang (Mr. Mulcahy) made some observations upon the subject when the New South Wales executive of the Labour party decided to support the Prime Minister. I shall be interested to know the views of the honorable member regarding the signing of the pledge. The article proceeded -","17"
"KNX","Therefore, stand together in defiant protest against an infamous and unconstitutional proclamation intended to wreck your unionism, lessen your standard of subsistence, terrorize your hearth and home, and manacle you and your children. Refuse to be bullied or lied or voted into the slavery of military control, under which your progress. - the admiration of a world - will be stayed and your life made unendurable.","17"
"KNX","I quote those extracts for the purpose of illustrating the background of the Prime Minister, because I wish to show the reasons for the introduction of this legislation. I am not at all satisfied that the introduction of the bill represents a sincere effort on the part of the right honorable gentleman. I may, in my later analysis, come to a conclusion that the House will readily accept; but I shall first examine some of the resolutions of the Labour party on the subject of conscription because, the Labour party is, wha<t the members who represent it are. On the 24th March, 1940, the conference of the New South Wales bran eli of the Australian Labour party agreed to the following resolution: -","17"
"KNX","At that time, the British Empire was fighting for its existence against Nazi-ism and Fascism, and, as the Minister for the Army has stated, ' every body knew that Japan would strike without, warning, and we were not making any provision to protect ourselves '. But the attitude of the Labour party is expressed in those words. The resolution continued -","17"
"KNX","I ask: Can the leopard change its spots? I do not think the Labour party can, though when in a dangerous position, it would like to be able to. No matter how it may manoeuvre, it cannot rid itself of the many spots upon its skin. . In June, 1940, the Victorian branch of the Labour party carried the following resolution: -","17"
"KNX","Again, the Labour party refused to countenance conscription in any shape or form. From its inception, the party has been opposed to conscription. Even after the Munich agreement in 193S, the then Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) declared : -","17"
"KNX","I say that any increase of defence expenditure after the Munich pact so far as Australia is concerned appears to me to be an utterly unjustifiable and hysterical piece of panic propaganda - that is what I say in respect of the alarmist statements that have been made.","17"
"KNX","Although the soil of New Guinea has been bathed with some of the best Australian blood, the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward) said on the 2nd November, 1938 -","17"
"KNX","It is amusing to hear people say that we shall not give up New Guinea - to those people I would say that if it should become necessary to defend our mandated territory they should defend it themselves. As far as I am eoncorned all I can judge about the necessity for retaining New Guinea is that a handful of exploiters have got hold of the country, some interested in aerial transport, some in gold mining, and some in search for oil. These people want to retain New Guinea in order ti; preserve their own commercial interests.","17"
"KNX","Speaking in this chamber on the 5th November, 1936, the Minister also said -","17"
"KNX","Some time ago the Minister for Social Services (Mr. Holloway) stated that he was opposed to any increase of expenditure for defence purposes. He would justify his attitude on the ground of his opposition to conscription. As the Labour party as a whole is opposed to conscription, I am led to wonder why at this juncture the Prime Minister has introduced this bill to effect conscription. The Minister for the Army painted a horrible picture of the danger that threatens Australia, but -the bill will not permit the proper movement of Australian soldiers to battle zones. For example, the boundary beyond which the Citizen Military Forces may not be sent excludes Lord Howe Island, which will be protected by New Zealand. I do not contend that the Government is not empowered to send Australian troops there; but New Zealand will be responsible for ensuring the security of the island, and Australia will not be bound to protect our sister dominion. The introduction of zones merely confuses the issue, and will make the free movement of our forces impossible in the South-west Pacific Area. All these anti-conscription sentiments of which I have spoken, have been manifested in definite opposition in Queensland and Victoria, and superficially to a lesser degree in New South Wales. Therefore, this crystallization of opinion in New South Wales, the chief State of the Commonwealth, appears to me to be significant .as to the boundaries fixed by the bill and the subsequent manoeuvres within the Labour party to try to effect its recall.","17"
"KNX","The only position that I am in is that I shall not condone the machinations of the Labour party in this regard. The bill is a miserable one and is no credit to Australia, but .it represents some advance. Certainly if it were defeated we- should get nothing. Sooner than allow that to happen, I am prepared to see the Labour party take the . first necessary step in a conscription policy, and break down the bigoted principles that have manacled it for the past 30 or 40 years. The bill, of course, makes no provision for one army, but at the same time we expect every other nation fighting in the Allied cause in this war to merge its army into one. Indeed all have done it, with the exception of the Union of South Africa. Every one of the belligerent nations has enforced conscription. Our sister dominions, and the United Kingdom and America have it. All the nations fighting on our side are sending their conscripts here - a position that was ably dealt with yesterday by the right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes). We, however, are not permitted to send all our troops to the help even of our sister dominion, New Zealand, or to relieve our own prisoners in Malaya, or to Singapore, or to encompass the deliverance of certain islands that are split in half by these extraordinary boundaries. The bill does not satisfy me or any other member on this side of the House; it is miserable in its conception and in its drafting, it does not fully and truly set out the opinions of the people of Australia, but it does at least offer a modicum of relief, and, rather than have it thrown under the table, I shall accept it as it is.","17"
"DTN",", - I cannot understand the position taken up by the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) today, and by the honorable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner) last night. They condemn the bill as being inadequate, insufficient and incomplete, but they intend to support it. Some honorable members opposite favour the amendment moved by the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) and the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Henty (Mr. Coles). I cannot understand why, if they are in favour of those amendments, they do not propose to support them. The suggestion made by the honorable member for Wentworth, that the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Henty has been arranged between him and the Government, i3 utterly and absolutely false. The honorable member for Henty has sincerely advocated a greater degree of compulsion than the present law permits, and has given notice of his amendment, because he honestly believes that that is the solution of the existing problem. The honorable member for Barker has acted with equal sincerity. But the theory that there is some scheme afoot to destroy the bill by putting forward amendments of this character is too fantastic and too subtle for any one to believe. I am sure that not a member of the House does believe it. These amendments really test the sincerity of honorable members who say that the bill does not go far enough. The main question to be debated - and I think it can be discussed on practically a non-party basis without heat or rancour - is whether, assuming that the present legal limits upon the employment of the Militia should be extended, any geographical limits should be placed upon such extended area. The fact is that some limits are imposed upon Australia by two considerations. The first is our limited resources of man-power. A strong case for unlimited compulsion can be made in countries the man-power of which is practically unlimited. But Australia is in a very different position. Do not let us argue from one country to another. Australia is short of man-power, and, as the High Commissioner for Canada said the other day, is reaching the bottom of the reservoir. I do not think that it is right to pretend to be able to plan to cover more than the most optimistic would regard as reasonably practicable over a substantial period of time. The argument against these particular boundaries, when it is analysed a little further, is an argument against any boundary at all. That is why the amendment of the honorable member for Barker, although quite impracticable, is also logical. Once any boundaries are fixed for an extended area, apparent anomalies and contradictions, of the kind that have been already pointed out in this debate, must at once arise. If we include the north-western tip of Java what reason is there for excluding Sumatra? If Sumatra is included, the next argument is : Why not include all the Malay States? So we should go on from step to step. If the Malay States are included, what is the reason for excluding Siam? If Siam is included, French Indo-China ought fairly to be included. If the Philippine Islands are included, the next step is Formosa, and so on. Whatever boundaries we fix, Ave can always pass on to the adjacent territory and ask why that is excluded. In relation to Malaya, there is an argument of apparent potency which the honorable member for Wentworth has mentioned, because of the deep and poignant anxiety of the relatives of the Australian prisoners of war taken there. But it is wrong to assume that all prisoners of war taken in Malaya are still there. The evidence available is, of course, not conclusive, but I have closely studied it, and it points to the conclusion that there has been at least a substantial transfer northwards of many Australian prisoners of war from Malaya, with its tropical conditions, to areas closer to Japan itself. Reports that we have received show that many Australian prisoners of war taken at Singapore are now in Siam, Formosa, French Indo-China, Korea, and Japan itself. We all support the supreme objective of redeeming and releasing our prisoners of war, but every one, not excluding the honorable member for Barker, will agree that that will occur when Japan is defeated, not in Malaya, but at the decisive point, wherever that may turn out to be. My view in the matter is that the area fixed in the bill represents the practical limits of our future land operations over a substantial period of time, it being the declared intention of the Government to proclaim the whole of the area immediately the bill is passed into law.","17"
"DTN","Yes. That is the Prime Minister's announcement, and it is the intention of the Government. I turn to the suggestion of the honorable member for Henty that the Government should have power to extend the area by proclamation. I submit that the suggestion is a somewhat unreal one. Parliament has complete liberty to alter the area. It is unthinkable that a government would ever proclaim a further extension unless it was certain that Parliament would endorse the extension. And Parliament could be called together in a very few days. I submit this view: The Prime Minister has had the labouring oar in this great matter. I think that Parliament should defer to his judgment. He is Minister for Defence and is in close touch with our military leaders. He has set his face against pretending to be able to do more than we can do, and yet he has made provision for the changing strategy over the next six or twelve months. He has therefore fixed a limit enormously extending the area in which the Militia Forces of Australia may be employed during the present war. The area of land outside Australia in which our Militia Forces may be employed will be increased by this measurefrom 183,000 square miles to about- 568,000 square miles. In view of that no one can say dogmatically that the area he has fixed will be found to be too limited, at any rate for a substantial period of time. That brings me to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Barker that there should be no limit of any kind. The amendment is logical, but in its logic completely overlooks all practical considerations of the man-power limitations placed on this country. I dispute altogether the theory that in the present circumstances we should necessarily and in all respects adopt the compulsory obligations imposed by the law in countries of relatively vast population. That argument would be far more cogent if this country itself and its approaches were not threatened; if Japan did not threaten our territories. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr. Eraser, made that point this morning. This continent is threatened, and it will continue to be until there is a definite change in the strategic position. This debate has taken an extraordinary turn. Most honorable members, I am sure, did not intend that there should be this series of attempts to understate the war effort of Australia. Proportionately speaking, it is as great as that of any other country in the war. Australia's sacrifices have been greater than those of other British dominions. Very great burdens will still fall upon us. We are the only British dominion which has faced, for twelve long arduous months, the danger of invasion by a ruthless foe. In truth, the nation is almost fully geared for total war. We have received magnificent assistance from both the American and the British Governments, but our own efforts must not be underrated for political reasons, lest irreparable harm be done to the understanding of our position both in Britain and in the United States. There are some points which I impress upon those who say, as the honorable member for Wentworth said, that this bill is inadequate and that there has been some 'letting down' of General MacArthur, as was stated by the honorable member for New England (Mr. Abbott). Let them remember - Almost the whole of our manpower has been diverted either to the armed forces, direct war work, or essential civilian production which must be regarded as war work. The number of Australians under arms in the three services to-day is almost double the number that served in the last war. The overall figure exceeds 700,000, and is the British equivalent of 4,250,000, the American equivalent of 13,250,000 and the Canadian equivalent of 1,100,000. The strength of the land forces in Australia has been nearly trebled since Japan declared war. The strength of the Royal Australian Air Force was greatly increased in 1942. The number of men and women diverted to direct war work of all kinds in 1942 substantially exceeded the number diverted in the entire four years of the last war and the first two years of this war. Since February. 1942, between 400,000 and 500,000 men and women have been diverted from civil production to the services or direct war work. Since the outbreak of war employees in government munition factories, including aircraft plants and shipbuilding yards, have increased by more than 800 per cent. In September, 1939, government factories employed 13,500 men and women, of whom only 1,300 were women. By the end of 1942, the number had increased to 113,000, of whom 26,000, or nearly a quarter, were women. The number of factory employees producing goods for the civilian market has been reduced by 64 per cent, since war began. Before the war, factory employees totalled 540,000, practically all of whom were producing for civilian needs-. Today only 194,000 are producing for the civilian population. Almost as many men and women are now producing war materials as were needed to supply the whole of the civilian needs of Australia before the war. From 540,000 before the war the overall number of factory employees has risen to 700,000, of whom 513,000 (or 72 per cent.) are on direct war work. Employment of women on direct war work in Australian factories has increased one hundredfold since war began. In September, 1939, there were only 1,300 women munition workers, all of who were employed in Government factories.Now there are 126,000-26,000 in Government factories and 100,000 working on direct war contracts in private factories. Approximately 25 per cent, of all munition workers are women. Since war began munitions production has enormously increased. Speaking of Australia's war effort, General MacArthur said only a few months ago -","17"
"JY7","Surely, it must be obvious that the weaker you are the greater the effort you have to make. Proportionately, America has not to make nearly the effort that is demanded < Australia, nor has Great Britain, apart from its proximity to Europe - if' that can be ruled out - because of our enormous territory, the smallness of our population1 and our danger.","17"
"JPN","That is the very argument that is being used against Great Britain now. It is said that force are being kept in Great Britain for home defence when they ought to be used for the opening of a second front in Europe.","17"
"JY7","If you happen to be only 24 miles distant from where the Germans are congregated in large numbers, presumably you have to keep a rather stronger force than would otherwise be needed in order to meet a sudden irruption. Great Britain does not receive lengthy notice as to when enemy aircraft are to be sent over; on the contrary, within five or ten minutes of their having left their base the aircraft are engaged in attacks on British cities and towns. That is an entirely different proposition from the one that we are considering. We have an enormous territory. In some measure, it is sequestrated from the rest of the world. In some ways, that is an advantage, whilst in other ways it is a disadvantage. What is likely to be thought of us by the Chinese, who have fought unceasingly for about six years, or by the Russians? I am completely free of all criticism in regard to the Russians, because they do not happen to have precisely the same political ideas as we hold. I have read works by a good many Russian authors. The Russians have been a great people for a long time, but never militarily as they have beendaring the last two years. To me, their performance- has been one of the wonder.? of the whole war. Are not we to do something to assist them, when they have- done so much to assist us, by holding up the German armies?","17"
"JY7","Of course I do, but it is not necessary to have young men, fit and unmarried, to make the ammunition. We could get women to do much of the work quite as well - some people think even better. It is time that some weeding out was done so that those who have so far remained behind may take their turn at the fighting. Of course, I know that it is necessary to retain many of the scientific men. Nobody but a fool would throw them away.","17"
"JY7","Is not the rural worker already there? I also believe that some effective weeding out might be done in the Public Services. We have myriads of public officials, not all of them old men, and a great many are associated with departments of mushroom growth which are really hindering rather than helping the war effort. More men could, I am convinced, be obtained from the universities. I have no desire to disparage the work of the universities, but university men should take their part to a greater extent in the fighting in common with other sections of the community. Perhaps they should be even more disposed to do so, because, being better educated, they should have a better realization of the issues involved. I know that the Minister for War Organization of Industry ('Mr. Dedman) has a plan in mind for the granting of bursaries for the training of young men in various branches of science. I realize that we must have veterinary officers and men qualified to engage in research work, but we must not overdo this sort of thing. I am not objecting to that, but I am afraid that there are many people whose main qualification for membership of a reserved occupation is that they have taken a university degree. If a university is to teach a man anything at all, it should be that when the time comes he should be willing to fight for his country, as well as make his intellectual knowledge available to it. In the Navy, Army and Air Force, there is ample scope for intellectual men. Anybody who has had association with any of the services knows that. I draw the attention of honorable members to the words of Rudyard Kipling, who, incidentally, lost his only son in the last war. In a speech at Edinburgh University in July, 1920, he said -","17"
"L0G","The Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin), the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) and the Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde) have all sought to justify this measure on two grounds, first, that it will fulfil all our military requirements as seen to-day, and, secondly, that the country is incapable of. making any greater military effort than is envisaged in the bill. With all due deference to those Ministers, I disagree profoundly with them. The military requirements of to-day, and most certainly those of the future, will demand far more from us than is proposed in this measure. Sooner or later we shall be compelled, both in the military sense and the moral sense, to put forward the whole of our strength into the fields in which that strength can be applied most usefully. Therefore, it seems to me that this measure, judged on that ground alone, falls short of this country's requirements. I shall not deal with our moral obligations at the moment; I shall confine my remarks to the second ground on which the Ministers to whom I have referred', have sought to justify this measure, namely, that it is the maximum military effort of which this country is capable. To any one who has studied the situation, such a claim is complete nonsense, because if it be admitted that our Citizen Military Forces can go forward to certain defined areas where they will be employed, in accordance with statements that have been made in this House, as lines of communication troops, then it is obvious that they can go even further forward. A point that should not escape the notice of honorable members is that if we take a certain section of our military forces and use it as a second line or second grade force, its morale and efficiency will be reduced. It is a well-known fact in military science that using troops for secondary purposes destroys not only their efficiency, but also their morale. There is no reason why our Citizen Military Forces should be earmarked for such jobs. It is true, as the Minister for the Army has said, that some of these mer are in lower physical categories than the men of the Australian Imperial Force, but at the same time, there are large numbers of troops in the Citizen Military Forces who, although they have not volunteered for service in the Australian Imperial Force, are of the required physical standard. There is no reason why these men should not be employed as front-line troops in places where they are required. For those reasons, I disagree emphatically with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Ministers whom I have mentioned. One is entitled to ask why the measure now before the House is so meagre in its scope compared with the proposals which were put forward when the Prime Minister opened, his negotiations with the Labour party. From remarks that have been made in this House and reports that have appeared in the press, it would appear that at, the very least the amalgamation of the two forces was in contemplation. The Prime Minister is reported to have said that there was no argument against the amalgamation of the two forces; yet this measure fails completely to satisfy that requirement. In the -light of these facts, honorable members are justified in inquiring why the change of attitude has taken place. Obviously, it could not have been due to any change in the military situation, because that situation to-day is substantially what it was when the approach to the Labour party was first made. Therefore, the only conclusion at which we can arrive is that the whittling down of the original proposals to those contained in this measure was done to stifle opposition within the Labour party itself, and to avoid a serious rift or split in its ranks. The only really commendable feature of this bill is that it represents a step in the right direction, namely, towards the establishment of a single army which may be used in any area that is considered vital to the defence of this country. For the Labour party, the measure constitutes a very important step; it is the crossing of the Rubicon It is true that the Rubicon in this case has not been crossed to any distance, but yet having been crossed, the whole field that lies ahead becomes more easily accessible. However, important as the Labour party's decision has been, this measure fails entirely to meet requirements and displays a complete lack of realism in the approach of the Government to the military situation which is facing this country and the United Nations generally to-day. I say advisedly that there is great disappointment among a large section of the people because this bill does not go further. There is a general feeling that once again the Labour party mountain has laboured and brought forth a ridiculously small mouse. The introduction of this measure is a disappointing anti-climax. For some months past the people of this country have been viewing with dismay the spectacle of the Prime Minister seeking the permission of the controlling authority of the Labour movement to remedy a state of affairs which since the entry of Japan into the war has constituted an insult to this nation, and the results that have been achieved by the Prime Minister are regarded with a considerable degree of astonishment. There was a general hope that the Government would have been prepared to go much further than it has gone in this bill. I for one did not expect that there would be an immediate amalgamation of the two forces, but there was a confident expectation that the area in which those forces would be permitted to serve would be considerably larger than the South-Western Pacific Zone specified in ' the bill. The area in which our forces may be used is arbitrarily limited within certain meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude. It bears no relation at all to the military requirements of the situation, or to our national obligations. The bill whittles down the area to practically nothing at all. On what principle can we decide that our troops can go to Sourabaya but may not proceed as far as Bandoeng or Batavia, or to Bougainville but not to Guadalcanal? New Zealand, Fiji and New Caledonia are outside the area, but those places together with the Solomons, Santa Cruz and the Hebrides are just as vital to the defence of this country as New Guinea or New Britain. This measure introduces into our system of defence a rigidity which seems to be entirely wrong. Under it, we can extend the area in which our troops can be employed, only by summoning the Parliament to pass the necessary legislation, which must receive the sanction of the Governor-General before it becomes law. In following that procedure, we shall proclaim our military plans to the whole world, and, particularly, to our enemies. It will indicate that we intend to take the offensive; and the Japanese know perfectly well what forces we have available for that purpose. The Japanese know a good deal better than1 most honorable members what troops we have available in the Australian Imperial Force for offensive action, and also in the Citizen Military Forces. Thus this measure by its very form gives information to the enemy which may be of great value to them not only now, but also in the future. For military reasons alone we should define a larger area. The effect of the bill will be deplorable. It will encourage our enemies, and dismay our friends. The Japanese have said for a long time that our heart is not wholly in this war. I, and other honorable members', have heard such broadcasts from Japan. They say that , whilst we may be prepared to defend ourselves if we be attacked, they doubt very much whether we have the spirit to employ the whole of our forces in an offensive action outside Australia. On our friends the effect of this measure will be bad indeed. Great Britain has flung, and is still flinging, into this gigantic conflict all its available troops regardless of geographical limits. But what of the effect on the United States of America, but for whose opportune aid we should, probably, to-day be suffering the ravages of invasion? We accept that country's aid with gratitude, and a sense of safety which we did not feel before; but we make no complaint that the American troops sent here were raised compulsorily. We do not regard it as degrading that conscripts should be sent here. The truth is that we shall degrade ourselves if we do not pay back in the same measure as we receive. The Government views its achievements, which it is constantly talking about, with great complacency. It fails to realize that its opinion of itself is not widely shared either in this country or abroad.' Not much news is given in our newspapers about the feeling of people overseas in this respect. Recently, the Prime Minister said specifically that there was no censorship of such reports; but the point is that whilst no such censorship may be exercised in this country, cur press correspondents overseas, particularly in Great Britain and the United States of America, are very chary of sending information which may be unpalatable to us. It is true that, generally speaking, the reputation of Australia stands high. I gather that from, reports which I have received from many sources. But that is due to one thing alone, namely, the achievements of our fighting men - our soldiers, sailors and airmen - overseas. It is they who are now writing Australia's name in letters of gold on the scroll of history. But we cannot pay a similar compliment to the Government. Information which throws some light on this aspect is trickling into the country. Quite a number of people in Australia receive letters from friends abroad from which they obtain some idea of what people overseas are thinking. Recently, I received the following letter from a friend of mine, an Englishman, who resides in London, and who has a great regard for Australia -","17"
"L0G","No. He is fighting for his ideals. To take the case a stage further, it can hardly be argued that because the Japanese are compulsorily enlisted they are therefore indifferent soldiers. The whole of our recent experience in the East, New Guinea and the islands has shown us that they fight most tenaciously, and are indeed very efficient soldiers. If the Minister for Labour and National Service and others persist in their view that voluntarily raised soldiers fight -better and more bravely than compulsorily enlisted ones do, they must admit that the reason why they fight bravely is their intrinsic value as men, rather than any effect of the system of training or enlistment to which they are subject. I shall never admit that our soldiers are intrinsically less brave and efficient than the Japanese, the Germans or those of any other foreign nation. As regards the attitude of Labour to the Army, the old Australian Imperial Force owed little or nothing to Labour. In the last war, when the best Australian battalions were wasting away for lack of reinforcements, and the whole of the Allied cause seemed to be at its last gasp, the Labour council in Sydney carried a resolution asking that the war should be stopped in the interests of the Allies. Similar resolutions could be found running through the whole of the Labour pronouncements during that war. I mention that, not because I wish to go back to what occurred then, which is not necessarily relevant to the present time, but because similar statements have been made at various Labour council meetings which have been taking place recently. lt is time that Labour pulled itself together, and really faced up to the realities of the modern world. Our soldiers are fighting to-day for Australia, and not for the coal-miners, the shopkeepers, the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, or any other section of the community. It is time that the Government itself took a rather wider view of its own responsibilities in this waT, and followed the views and principles of our soldiers themselves. I freely admit that so far the Government has done much towards helping Australia's war effort, but at the same time its purpose has not been singleminded. It has been, and still is to a great extent, serving the sectional interests of the particular parties which support it. It is time that the Government settled down to fight this war without regard to any change or otherwise in the present internal situation. We surely have enough on our hands at the present time without trying to upset the existing structure of society. That can be done, if necessary, when the war comes to an end. If our purpose is deflected by the demands of various sectional interests, our total war effort will not be so strong or so firm as it should be. To win this war we must be united. To-day we have not- a united Parliament, a united Government, a united people, or a united Army.","17"

"KX7","Last Friday, in the course of a speech to this House, the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) made a series of allegations against the administration of man-power in Australia. I propose to take some of the major misrepresentations made by the honorable member in his speech and to answer them in some detail. The honorable member said at one stage -","17"
"KX7","The true position is that the rights of an employer to terminate the services of an employee in a business which has not been declared protected are in no way affected by the Man Power Regulations and the services of such an employee may be terminated so long as the provisions of the appropriate award are observed. In the case of a protected undertaking, an employer shall not terminate the employment of any person engaged in that protected undertaking without the permission in writing of the Director-General of Man Power or a person authorized by him. Provision is made to enable appeals to be placed before a local appeals board. Where an employer in a protected undertaking has reason to ibelieve that an employee has been guilty of serious misconduct he can suspend the employee from duty, but must submit to the Director-General of Man Power or a person authorized by him a statement in writing setting out the grounds of the suspension. Before the employee can be dismissed, the suspension must be confirmed by the Man Power authorities. The honorable member alleged that all charges of serious misconduct are reduced to charges of misconduct and the employee is ordered to return to his job. That the honorable member's charges are ill-founded and without any basis of truth may be seen from the results of appeals lodged. More than 100,000 decisions have been given under these sections of the Man Power Regulations and against these decisions only 416 appeals had been lodged up till the 31st December, 1942. Details of these appeals are as follows: - Employers lodged 114 appeals. They withdrew 18 of these: 41 decisions were given in the employer's favour and 51 against. Employees lodged 302 appeals. They withdrew 85 of these : 118 decisions were given in the employee's favour and 155 against. From these figures it will be seen that in all, 196 appeals were decided in favour of the employer, while only 169 were given in favour of the employee. Quite obviously, the honorable member did not know these facts when he made his irresponsible criticism. The honorable member made another allegation, equally inaccurate, when he said -","17"
"KX7","Throughout the time that this Government has been administering man-power, it has acted in accordance with its charter which lays down that the object of the Man Power Regulations is -","17"
"KX7","Further, national service officers have been instructed that the question of whether permission to transfer shall be granted must be considered in the light of all the surrounding circumstances and the monetary factor is to be disregarded entirely where the person's services are more valuable to the war effort in another capacity. The honorable member also alleged that one firm, Stromberg Carlson (Australia) Proprietary Limited, had lodged 97 appeals with the man-power authorities, of which the employees had won 92. I have been more reliably informed by a person -whose duty it is to be accurately informed of man-power facts, that there is no record of any appeal ever having been lodged by this firm. There is only one appeal in which the firm's name appears and that was lodged by an employee. The honorable member also made reference to a number of cases which he said illustrated mismanagement of man-power. He instanced the case of Mr. H. Trot, who was suspended by Stromberg Carlson (Australia) Proprietary Limited for alleged misconduct in objecting to an instruction given by a foreman. After a full inquiry had been made into the case, the investigating officer - a man with more than 20 years of experience in the State Department of Labour and industry - reported that in his opinion if misconduct was committed it was committed by the foreman and that there appeared to be no justification for suspending Trot. Consequently, the employee's reinstatement was ordered with pay for all time lost by reason of his suspension. Later the employee agreed to take his clearance from the firm after he was paid for time lost. Another case instanced by the honorable member was that a release had been granted to a Miss Bennett to leave her employment with Stromberg Carlson (Australia) Proprietary Limited. In this case the applicant's release was approved after a full investigation, and the employer did not exercise his right of appeal. In respect of Mr. George Hancock, toolmaker, a communication was received complaining that this man had left his employment without permission. Hancock had given a week's notice one day prior to the company being declared a protected industry. As notice had been given of intention to leave prior to the firm becoming a protected industry, it is doubtful whether a conviction could be sustained by a prosecution. Stromberg Carlson (Australia) Proprietary Limited, the firm concerned, was informed that every effort had been made to induce Hancock to return to its employment, but that the man-power regulations did not provide the necessary power to force him to return. With regard to the honorable member's statement that skilled men were transferred from an engineering establishment at Newcastle to a shipbuilding yard, the position was that applications were made by the men for release and approvals were given. The company appealed and a conference was held at which a settlement satisfactory to all parties was reached. When the honorable member of artillery fame laid down his barrage of criticism of man-power administration, he did not worry himself unnecessarily with facts. As a result, what he hoped to be a shattering barrage proved, to be a broadside of ill-aimed duds.","17"
"KA9","I understand that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is giving consideration to entering into a new contract for the printing of the A.B.C. Weekly. I therefore take this opportunity to urge upon the Government the advisability of its giving consideration to the wisdom of continuing the publication of this journal which, as I have recently ascertained, is continuing to show a huge loss. In the year ended the 30th June, 1942, the total expenditure was ?46,000 and the revenue - advertising and sales- ?17,041, a loss of ?28,959 per annum, or over ?550 a week. But that is not the worst feature. This journal was published to -provide listeners with the programmes, but as a matter of fact only 3 per cent, of licence-holders subscribe to the journal. So. from that point of view, the journal is indeed a futile experiment. At least a dozen journals are published in Australia to supply the same information as is contained in the A. B.C. Weekly. It might be worth while if the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr. Dedman) paid the same attention to this activity as he has paid to many others in this country. I am concerned about the waste of money, for how can we expect the people to heed our appeals for austerity when we continue to squander not only money but also materials and man-power in the publication of this journal?","17"
"KUN","I listened with great interest this morning to the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) assure the House that the high wages paid in some instances to men employed by the Allied Works Council were due to the fact that award rates and conditions and overtime rates operated. I assumed that that was the ease, hut I was glad to have the right honorable gentleman's assurance. I hope that within a day or two the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) will tell us of the need, to stabilize finances and to levy additional taxes in Australia. The time has come for the Government to examine public expenditure iri order to ascertain how money might be saved in order to lessen the cost of the war. I ask the Government to inform itself upon a statement which appeared recently in the Goulburn Penny-Past. I shall hand the Treasurer the report, which contains a statement by Mr. J. Barry, who is said to be a well-known Goulburn identity recently returned from the north, and who was employed at Rockhampton and Charters Towers. If this statement be correct it demands the closest inquiry to rectify the position he describes. If it is not correct the Government should procure the information to enable it to say so. The report states that Mr. Barry was amazed at the conditions and was satisfied that things could not continue as at present. He had never seen anything like it - cooks earning £40 a fortnight and lorry drivers £52 a fortnight, although they did not supply their own lorries. This man says that one can .see on the roads gangers who have never had experience of that class of work. Some of them were greengrocers before they were called up by the Allied Works Council. He affirms that it does not matter to them that they work lengthy periods of overtime for which they receive extra payment, because the breaks between the work are so long and frequent that it is doubtful whether they work eight hours a day. He speaks of one poorly paid old man who had nothing to do except boil the billy, for which he received only £17 a fortnight. He states that these payments are in addition to the keep which is provided for the men. He mentions that before he joined the Allied Works Council he was in the Army, and was discharged for health reasons; but he now has three sons in the Army, ' and they are getting only six bob a day '.","17"
"KUN","He goes on to explain -","17"
"KUN","I confess I got my cut of the money just the same ns the rest of them, but you can't tell me I earned it. At Christmas time, over a fortnight, I drew ?31 14s. 7d. Taxes took about ?8, so you see I still had a pretty good wad. I've never seen such a good thing in my life and the country can't carry on with it; that should be plain for any one.","17"
"KUN","I do not know that he has left it. He is back at Goulburn, but he may be on leave. I am not able to say whether or not he has left, and am merely quoting from a newspaper report his statements regarding the duties that have to be performed. He concludes -","17"
"JLZ","I draw the attention of the House to the increasing disregard shown by certain Public Servicebureaucrats, as they have been described in certain quarters, in their relations with the public. At times, departmental officials completely ignore letters addressed to them by members of the public in relation to matters upon which the livelihood of the writer may depend. In some instances letters are not even replied to, unless a member of Parliament intervenes. I shall cite a remarkable example of such neglect - I stress the fact that it is only an example of what is going on, because I have had numerous complaints of this nature from time to time, as no doubt have other honorable members. This matter concerns the administration by the Department of Trade and Customs of liquor rationing which is a most important matter to those who are engaged in supplying liquor to the public. To-day some hotelkeepers are having difficulty in making their businesses pay, and are striving hard to avert possible bankruptcy owing to the inadequate supplies of liquor that they are receiving. To such people it is a matter of great moment that their claims should be carefully, competently, and reasonably considered. I am not concerned at the moment with the merits of any particular case or whether this or that publican is entitled to a greater quota than he is receiving - that is a matter for determination in the light of the facts - but I contend that when an application is made to the Department of Trade and Customs or to any other Government department, the applicant is entitled at least to reasonable, prompt, and courteous consideration of his case. The example which I shall cite to honorable members concerns a small hotelkeeper in my district. I shall be pleased to supply the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) with the man's name so that he can take the matter up if he so desires. The sequence of events has been set out by this hotel-keeper as follows : -","17"
"JLZ","October 10th: Wrote Collector of Customs for beer increase and enclosed certificate from secretary Canegrowers Association showing increase in association employees of 108 men. - No reply. November 13th: Wrote Collector of Customs for reply to letter of October 10th. - No reply. November 27th: Sent Collector of Customs reply-paid telegram for reply to letters October 10th and November 13th. -Reply refused increase. November 30th: Wrote Mr. Mitchell personal letter. - No reply. December 30th: Wired Collector of Customs advising 50 additional cane-cutters employed; asked for increase, January and February. January 4th, 1943: Letter received refusing request.","17"
"JLZ","To all his communications from the 10th October, 1942, until the 4th January, 1943, he received replies to only two ' reply-paid ' telegrams. The time has arrived when a stand must be taken against this sort of thing. Action must be taken to counter the increasing insolence of those individuals who, because they have been placed in a position of temporary authority, think that they can treat the public as they like. On more than one occasion I have had reason for complaint, not only in respect of the Department of Trade and Customs, but also other Government departments, and. I have drawn attention to this particular case in. the hope that Ministers will take steps to see that the interests of the public are protected in the future. The second matter to which I wish to refer relates to the claims made to the Department of the Treasury for compensation in respect of war damage to property. Fortunately, only a few such claims have arisen on the mainland, but quite a number of residents of New Guinea, particularly Rabaul, Lae and Salamaua, have lost everything, and I can only describe the treatment that has been meted out to them as ' scurvy '. I have met a number of people who have lost their homes and their entire personal effects, and I propose to read to honorable members a letter which I have received from a former New Guinea resident who has made a claim to the War Damage Commission. This letter will indicate just how he has been treated. If this is an example of how other similar claims are being handled, it is time that action was taken. The claimant to whom 1 refer is Mr. H. W. Quinton, and he writes as follows: -","17"
"JLZ","Knowing your interest in the wellbeing of former residents of New Guinea,I am taking the liberty of approaching you in regard to the question of War Damage Insurance as it affects us. Throughout the conduct of my negotiations with the CommissionI have regarded mine as a test case so that I could pass on the benefit of my experience to those who are in like circumstances. After some correspondence with the Commission,I had an interview with Mr. Gronin, State Superintendent of Claims in New South Wales, who asked me to submit a statutory declaration to support my claim, also to obtain others from persons who were aware of conditions at Lae and of happenings there on 21st January, 1942, and afterwards. I.did so and submitted them to the Commission together with a letter from Burns Philp and Co. regarding thetransport of my effects fromRabaul to Lae and marine insurance. I received a communication from the Commission dated 27th November, 1942, which, interalia, stated: 'I have to advise that the Commission is satisfied that the evidence submitted by yon indicates on examination, support for the sum of £208 10s. and that the damage was 'war damage'. This, in the opinion of the Commission,carries your claim as near to finality as can be reached at this juncture. . . . The foregoing statements are without prejudice to the right of the Commission to review, for the Commission is not disposed to formally admit liability and assess and record your claim until it is possible to inspect the damage and secure such further informationas may be procurable in the territory.' I was not altogether satisfied with this reply and asked if my claim could not be recorded. The reply was : ' As mentioned in my previous letter, the Commission is not, at this stage, prepared to record your claim.' No direct reply was given to my question. I am of the opinion that the Commission's ruling leaves much to be desired. I have furnished them with the best evidence available, that of eye-witnesses. Apparently at a distant date in the future, some one will visit the territory to assess the damage (in all probability a person to whom New Guinea is but a name) and conduct inquiries on the spot. The evidence he will receive will be hearsay only. He will have to rely for his information on whoever happens to be in the particular area at the moment. The person or persons may not have been there when the damage took place, and any information gained from such a course would not be first-hand nor comparable with evidence such as I and others have submitted.","17"
"JLZ","Quinton's case is but a test case. Many ex-residents of Rabaul, Lae and Salamaua, who have lost all their possessions, have applied to the commission to have their claims recorded. They have not applied for immediate compensation. They simply want the damage recorded in the commission's books. In response to such requests they have -received red tape replies, a sample of which I have just read. Disregarding the fact that Lae, Salamaua and Rabaul will be practically obliterated when they are recaptured, the commission says that before recording any claims it will send some one to New Guinea, after the Japanese have left, in order to inspect and record the damage. Could anything be more absurd? Is it fair to keep these people in suspense until we recapture that territory? In the meantime they will have no legal rights whatever. They are Australian citizens who acted as the custodians of our territories in the north. They are to be kept in a state of uncertainty as to what compensation they may receive as war damage. The policy of the commission should be reviewed, and a much more sympathetic and sensible approach made to matters of this kind. The commission's present attitude is unreasonable. It intends to keep these people waiting until the end of the war, whereas to-day evidence in support of claims can be obtained from witnesses who have the facts fresh in their minds, and can possibly describe the homes and furniture destroyed. After the war these witnesses will have dispersed, or may be dead. The commission will then determine, at that uncertain time in the future, the loss sustained by these persons in 1942. This matter is one of urgency to a very large number of people. I have merely cited, the Quinton case as a test case regarding the policy which the commission now intends to adopt. The Government should ensure that a more sympathetic approach is made by the commission towards such claims.","17"
"KX7","by leave - The honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) and the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) referred to the ventilation of the parliamentary refreshment-rooms. Undoubtedly, Mr. Speaker, you will deal with their observations. I merely take this opportunity to indicate that, if required, the services of technical officers of the Department of Labour and National Service will be made available in the matter. The honorable member for Lilley (Mr. Jolly) and the honorable member for Melbourne asked whether it was intended to continue the publication of the A.B.C. Weekly. Until the result of the investigation now being made into that matter is made known, nothing further can be said about it. The position of the metropolitan and provincial newspapers will receive attention by the appropriate Ministers in connexion with the decision of the Government to rationalize industry in order to meet our urgent man-power requirements. That industry shall not be overlooked.","17"
"KX7","The honorable member implied that costs were mounting because of the payment of overtime to the workers. I ask the House to bear in mind that the workers are now obliged to work overtime and are thereby subject to industrial fatigue. They are, therefore, already making a great sacrifice in working long hours. Further, honorable members opposite are now advocating that the lower paid workers should be brought within the income tax field. To-day, the workers find that although they are working longer hours, and the amount they receive in wages is higher, they are faced with rising living costs, and, directly and indirectly, are paying more in taxes. Consequently, if there is to 'be a review of rising war costs, it should embrace all costs and not be confined merely to the wages of the workers. For instance, the Government should give prompt attention to the profits which are being earned by private enterprise in the carrying out of war contracts.","12"
