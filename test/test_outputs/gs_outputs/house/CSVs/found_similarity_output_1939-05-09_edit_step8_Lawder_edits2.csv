"KZX","In view of the Government's intention to establish a reserve of 90,000 returned soldiers for the purpose of defending Australia should the occasion arise, I ask the Minister for Defence the following questions : - Is he aware that there are two bona fide and recognized returned soldier organizations in existence in Queensland, namely, the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia and the Diggers' Association? If so, is it a fact that his department has given sole authority to the Returned Sailors, and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia as the only outside body to enlist returned soldiers into the proposed reserve? If the answers to questions 1 and 2 be in the affirmative, will the Minister reconsider his decision, with a view to consulting with the Diggers' Association of Queensland, thereby granting to that association the same authority as is proposed to be granted to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia in respect of enlistment for the proposed reserve?","17"
"K4X","I ask the Minister for Defence the following questions : - In view of the conditions, size and description of the class and quality of country required for the Royal Australian Air Force Flying Training School as laid down by the official party commanded by Group Captain Wrigley to the Narrandera Municipal Council, will the Minister assure the House that the site selected at Wagga meets all requirements? As the ground inspected between Narrandera and Grong Grong was described by the inspecting officers as a perfect site for a flying training school, particularly taking into account the safety factor, so important to trainee pilots, and also taking into account the fact that it is capable of very considerable expansion, why was this site not chosen? Could a copy of the detailed report of the official party, led by Group Captain Wrigley, regarding the comparative suitability of the area selected and the area between Narrandera and Grong Grong, be made available to the House forthwith? Is it not a fact that negotiations had been entered into for the resumption of the land at Wagga before the report of Group Captain Wrigley and his party was filed? Has the Cabinet or the Minister taken into consideration the fact that if Burrinjuck Dam should be destroyed or should collapse, the major portion of Wagga would be submerged and totally destroyed? Will the establishment of the air school at Wagga be deferred pending the House being satisfied that the best site has, in fact, been chosen?","17"

As for the latest incident, the matter has been in the hands of the Minister for Defence, who has, I believe, arranged to have a consultation about it with representatives of the Air Board and of the press, including a representative or representatives of the Australian Journalists Association. It is anticipated that, as the result of that consultation, some working rule will be evolved which will prevent any such incident in the future.","17"

Does the Government intend to proceed with this measure this session?","17"
"KFS","I lay on the table the Annual Report of the Department of External Affairs for the year 1938, and move -","17"
"KFS","In doing so, I ask the indulgence of honorable members while I make a statement upon current foreign affairs, after which the Government invites general debate. In the view of the Government, it is desirable that opportunities for expression of views upon foreign affairs be more frequent than hitherto. The time has come when Australia should show a keener interest, and play a larger part, in discussions and consultations upon foreign affairs, and especially, as my right honorable leader (Mr. Menzies) has already said, in the affairs of the Pacific. This annual report was of course prepared before my coming into office; the ministerial responsibility for it rests upon my right honorable friend, the present Attorney-General (Mr. Hughes), and it contains a foreword from his gifted pen. It is, as I think honorable members will agree, a sound production, and presents a vivid and accurate picture of the international affairs of a notoriously interesting and fateful year. As it has already been distributed to honorable members, I shall say no more of it than this: it reflects the high level of zeal and capacity of the staff of the External Affairs Department. This department is the Cinderella, I think, of our permanent departments, but it has already become distinguished by the quality of its work in a field in which standards throughout the world are high. The House might be interested in one or two personal impressions gathered during a fortnight's intensive reading of what might be termed the inside story of the international moves over the last fortnight and the preceding two or three months. The first impression onereceives in this office to-day would give satisfaction to any serious-minded Australian. The information which comes to the Commonwealth hour by hour over the period of each day in which overseas telegrams are received is remarkable for its range and detail. All that is of the least importance upon current foreign affairs is known in Canberra a few hours after it has been handled by the British Foreign Office. This means that the vital points of every despatch from the United Kingdom Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Lord Halifax, to his Ambassadors and Ministers are also telegraphed forthwith to the Commonwealth Government. On the other side, every pertinent fact, opinion or view which reaches the Foreign Secretary from his Ambassadors and Ministers is immediately re-telegraphed to us. This diplomatic service is not confined to the activities of the British embassies and legations, but includes a multitude of reports from consuls and agents spread not only throughout Europe and parts of Asia but also over many countries even further afield. The Commonwealth Government has four channels of advice always in operation. Officers of the External Affairs Department in London, who have direct access to all Foreign Office sections, despatch with speed the most important news; the Dominions Office communicates a somewhat fuller story; the High Commissioner in London (Mr. Bruce) reports at once upon his consultations with British Ministers; and the many representatives abroad of the Commerce Department frequently add information of particular interest and value to Australia. Further, it is now the practice with the concurrence of the British Government for the Commonwealth to address communications direct to the embassies, legations and consulates in every foreign country upon matters of Australian concern. One's next impression comes from a very vigilant scrutiny in which every new Minister of this department would, under the present conditions in Europe, at once engage. I have, as I am sure any honorable member in my position would do, examined every despatch and other document in quest of the motive behind the minds of the anti-aggression countries of Europe in their present efforts, under the leadership of the Government of the United Kingdom, to come together in a supreme effort to resist further trespass by the two totalitarian states. Out of such a scrutiny comes not only the impression, but also the entire conviction, that the motive is peace, and peace only. In no phrase or word, or in the spirit of all this inside information, is there a semblance of anything but defensiveness. There is not a breath that suggests that there is in the democratic countries, which are endeavouring to get together, anything but the desire to be left alone, so that they may go their peaceful, happy ways. Throughout all these recorded conversations and consultations between the defensive nations, there is an ardent, almost a pathetic desire and prayer for peace. This is not, I think, to be attributed to fear of the Fuhrer of Germany or the Duce of Italy, and their vast armed legions and various hideous engines of destruction. It is due to the fear of modern war. All or nearly all of the powers of Europe concerned in the negotiations of the moment have been through, the horrors of modern conflict and the almost equal punishment which attends the so-called victor and the actually vanquished. Indeed, fear of actual war even by the dictator nations is the strongest factor that is working for peace. All available information indicates that if to-day public opinion had a chance to express itself, peace would run its pleasant, fruitful course in Europe for a long time to come. Even in Germany and Italy a secret and fair ballot would reveal a majority for peace by negotiation not less than such a vote would show in Australia itself. But, although that is undeniable, all of the inside news points to the fact that, while the German people pray for peace even as we do, they are to-day the slaves of a dictatorship as absolute as any that Asia ever knew in dark and ancient days. Whatever they hope or think, they will respond to the call of Hitler; and what is in Hitler's mind from day to day few people know. It would, therefore, be presumptuous and idle to advance an opinion to honorable members and Australia as to whether the near future holds for us peace or war. But it is, perhaps, legitimate for me on behalf of the Government to bring again to light certain- facts which seem to bear upon the endeavour of us all to probe the momentous secret of the days close ahead. When we are disposed to take a gloomy view of the present crisis, we should not overlook that we have been living in a similar and sometimes an even more acute state of crisis for nearly four years, and so far have escaped general European and world war. During Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, there were days of danger of a general international clash quite as acute as those of the moment. The same comment can be fairly made of many phases of the Civil War in Spain, of the absorption of Austria by Germany, of the destruction of Czechoslovakia, and the invasion of China. During each of these affairs there were numerous incidents which, prior to 1914, must almost inevitably have led to general warfare in Europe, but which, because of the dread of modern war between great powers that has haunted all responsible minds since 1918, have been more or less ignored by the affronted and injured third parties. This disposition not to accept incidents as justification for a declaration of war marks, perhaps, the most noteworthy, advance towards the maintenance of peace among the nations. Certainly the mind of Signor Mussolini, appears, at the moment, susceptible to the fear of the terrible consequences of real war between great European equals. Of the mind of Herr Hitler, nothing is certain. But this is undeniable. Both these dictators, but especially Hitler, will take all they can by bloodless mobilization and demonstration against any weak neighbouring country which .they have previously fomented by insidious influences into a state of unrest and demonstrations against Germany or Italy, or German or Italian nationals. Further, in Hitler's mind international morality is not of a kind familiar in other countries. His undertaking at Munich to be content with the gain of Sudetenland was broken only a few months later. His avowal that he coveted no country peopled by non-Germans has proved of equal worth.","17"
"KFS","So Czechoslovakia was dismembered. Soin recent weeks Roumania, Poland and certain Balkan countries have been threatened. Beyond reasonable doubt, without unity among themselves and support from outside, all of these peoples made up of distinctive races and possessed of national independence would, with their vast aggregate manpower and resources, have been gathered under the dominion of Germany, or in some degree of Italy. Standing alone they would one by one have gone the way of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Albania. Eastward and south-eastward there would, as all evidence and information go clearly to show, have been no halt by land to the triumphant march of the totalitarian hosts. And what next? With each unprincipled acquisition so far made, the tension between Germany and Italy on the one side, and the only two powers for whom they have military respect, Britain and France, on the other, has increased. With each future stage - I would emphasize the word ' future ' - in the overthrow of the lesser democracies by Germany and Italy, the feeling between the two major groups must have intensified. Present in every thinking mind in Western Europe was the enlarging thought that the time would come in the not distant future when Germany and Italy, enriched and strengthened beyond measure by their eastern and southeastern gains, would have turned their minds and forces westward. It is disclosing no secret to say that in very recent months, even weeks, there has been profound concern for Holland, Switzerland, Belgium and even Denmark. A Germany supported by Italy, and astride the manpower and war-making material of Europe from the frontiers of Russia, the Black Sea and the Dardanelles to the North Sea coastline, was not a picture painted by British and French and even American minds in any moment of panic. It was a very potential reality, and I need not dwell upon its significance to Australia and the other dominions. The acts of Germany and Italy during the last eight months, their open plans of to-day, and the speeches of their leaders, made their dream and intention clear to all the world. The realization of the position has moved the governments of the United Kingdom and of France into action. Britain, with a spirit of leadership consistent with its place in the world, has initiated and led in an attempt to bring about a temporary unity among those countries which, standing singly in isolation, appeared to be doomed to the loss of their nationhood and independent soul by the ruthless sweep of Germany and Italy. Alone in some cases, in collaboration with France in others, the British Government has promised instant and the fullest possible aid to the threatened lands, and at the same time British diplomacy has worked as it has never worked before to bring those countries together as a united force to resist the dictators. Some may say that this attempt is belated, but that would be to disclose lack of appreciation of the deep-rooted difficulties to be overcome if defensive unity is to be even substantially achieved. The countries of Eastern Europe and (he Balkans are not easily merged for a common purpose. Even six weeks ago an attempt to bring them together in a common resistance to the dictators would probably have totally failed. For many years they have been among themselves scarcely close friends. At least this is true of some of them. Territorial argument has been strong among them. Not until the shadow of the mobilized and marching legions of Germany began to deepen over them one by one, did it become opportune for Britain to attempt their combination for their common Salvation. According to the Government's latest advices, the progress made in this great Anglo-French attempt is this: Honorable members will understand that the basis . of all these negotiations is the AngloFrench unity. The United Kingdom and France have guaranteed the integrity and independence of Belgium. France and Britain have entered into an obligation with Poland whereby, in the event of aggression to which Poland offers resistance, they will at once intervene. Poland has entered into reciprocal obligations to Britain and France. Great Britain end France have given the same undertaking to Greece and Roumania. Turkey and Britain are engaged in negotiations marked by promise of success. The position with respect to Russia is at this moment complicated and obscure. From the outset of the swift negotiations, the urgent need for fitting the Soviet into the defensive scheme has been strong in the minds of the British and French Governments. But the obstacles to be overcome before this could be accomplished have been great indeed. For example, Germany has been quick to declare to -the world, and especially to her own people, that the Anglo-French attempt to form a purely defence bloc is, in reality, a move to bring about a potentially offensive encirclement of Germany. If Russia were to become engaged in an .actual temporary defensive alliance with the United Kingdom and France, colour would be given to Germany'3 assertion. Then, neither Roumania, Poland nor lesser Baltic countries would look with easy minds upon an unlimited transit of their countries by Russian armies in the event of war.","17"
"KFS","Yes, but Esthonia is mentioned in to-day's cables. There is, too, the Japanese consideration, and the danger that a positive military alliance, however defensive and temporary, between Russia, the United Kingdom and France might possibly drive Japan into a similar opposing alliance with Germany and Italy. M. Litvinoff, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, has gone suddenly into retirement, and down to this morning there was no specific news of the negotiations proceeding with the Soviet. Over the week-end the newspapers have published messages which indicate hopeful developments with respect to both Italy and Japan. In some degree this news is supported by advice received by the 'Government, but as yet it is not actually confirmed. Nevertheless, the available information taken on balance does suggest that neither Japan nor Italy would be eager participants in a world war against the non-aggression countries. To them an arresting point must be that at the moment the democracies are a force of unknown dimensions, and that this is true not only of Europe, including Russia, but - what is of high significance - also of the Pacific. A thought which is ever present in the minds of the parties to the AntiComintern Pact is that American sympathy is strongly with the democratic nations; that America was eventually moved to enter the last world war, with all its vast man power and resources; that America is arming upon an unprecedented scale, and has an unparalleled purse upon which to draw; that President Roosevelt has advanced his famous proposals for settlement by negotiation; and that relations are strained between the President and the Fuhrer, their respective Ambassadors being still absent from their posts. A further consideration common to both Japan and Italy is that neither is in a robust economic or financial position. Both might well be in favour of peace by conference rather than by war. I wish shortly to dwell upon the situation of Japan in relation to the British Empire. I venture to submit two questions to this honorable House and to Japan. They are: Why, in the event of wai1, or even in these days in which wc live under the shadow of war, should Japan prefer its new friends in the AntiComintern Pact, to its far older friends throughout the British Empire? Why should there bo at this moment in Japan a powerful school of thought - though fortunately a minority school - urging that the Anti-Comintern Pact to which Japan is a signatory should be hardened into a military alliance? These are very important questions not only to Japan and to the people of Australia and the whole of the British Empire, but also to the 130,000,000 people who make up the United States of America. Why should Japan enter upon a war - I do not suggest that it will, and the latest news from Japan declares that it will not - which would be of incalculable proportions and dangers to it in the Pacific; a war in which only two things would be certain : First, that Japan could never emerge from it with victory; and secondly, that all the combatants would suffer incalculable loss of young manhood and every kind of prolonged economic and social punishment. I venture strongly to suggest that these questions are to-day in the minds of the statesmen of Japan, and of a great majority of its people. I venture also to believe that strong in the Japanese mind is the reflection that its closest and most trusted and trusty friends from the date of its famous revolution and all through its marvellous rise to world greatness until very recent years, were the peoples and the governments of the British Empire. I venture further to affirm that Japan has to-day a vivid consciousness that it was happier and more at rest, and indeed safer, with its old friend and ally than with its new ones. On our side we greatly valued that old friendship; and whatever the future may hold for us, we and our children after us will never cease to honour Japan for the wholehearted way in which it honoured its partnership in the AngloJapanese Treaty during the dark days of the world war. Not without some confidence does the Commonwealth Government, of. which at the moment I am the mouthpiece, look forward to a nearer and more auspicious relationship with 'the great Japanese people than that which prevails to-day. Turning to Italy, one finds it uncommonly hard to believe that Signor Mussolini will, apart from other considerations, gamble his wonderful services to his people by leading them into a war, or by having them dragged into one by Germany. Mussolini found Italy after the war dejected, exhausted, divided against itself and in danger of collapse and partition. Within less than twenty years, by his genius, his patriotism, and his irresistible stimulus and almost superhuman capacity, he has lifted his country to a proud place among the first-class powers. Will he fling this superb achievement into the flames of war? And of Herr Hitler. Those who believe war to be inevitable will turn to the Fuhrer's broken bonds, his descent upon Austria, his smashing up of Czechoslovakia, his treatment of the Jews, and his apparent intention to dominate Ronmania and Poland, if he could carry it through without general warfare. But against the dark deeds of this phenomenal man, there is to his credit, as there is to the credit of Mussolini, a great and shining record of service to his people. He found the mighty German race broken, helpless, leaderless, and in despair. Within seven years he has restored to them their pride and their power, and disclosed to them, provided they are not again shattered and impoverished by war, a near future of great glory. Will Hitler, now that it is made plain to him that bloodless mobilization, demonstration and intrigue, will no longer win him enlarged dominion, pause and consolidate his Germany, and give to it early prosperity and riches by relieving it of the crushing burden of armaments? Or will he lead the German hosts of youth into the shambles of a gigantic general war from which there can be victory or profit for none, but out of which must come infinite sacrifice and a long, long train of grief and suffering for at least half the peoples of the world? Is the decision to be war, or the conference table? To that question I venture no reply. But I go so far as to express the view that, from the information in the hands of the Government, every day's peace from this moment onward is a better day in its prospect. Honorable members will have read of the further formal consolidation of the military alliance between Germany and Italy. In the opinion of the Commonwealth Government, this step is of little significance, except perhaps in that it may be interpreted as an expression of concern by the dictators at the progress of the development of the defensive bloc. The two signatories to the renewed bond declare it to be an instrument with a peaceful purpose. One ventures to voice the view that it lies within the hands of Germany and Italy to restore peace to Europe and to the world at any moment. Let them but make a sincere gesture for the settlement of their grievances by negotiation, and the response from all countries would be immediate. They are not asked to surrender prestige or to enter into conference as supplicants. Let them but suggest a solution by means other than by arms, and the attitude of the leading democracies would perhaps surprise them by its reasonableness, and even by its generosity. In conclusion, I turn to the most vital consideration of all to the Australian people, and that is the decision which must at once be made by the Commonwealth in the event of the Government of the United Kingdom becoming engaged in a war arising out of the present situation. In the course of his broadcast speech to the nation on the 26th April, the Prime Minister used words which were of such profound importance that they should be repeated again and again. He then said -","17"
"KFS","With the concurrence of my right honorable leader, I point out that these words are not to be interpreted to mean that in any and every set of circumstances the foreign policy of a government of the United Kingdom, if it led to war, should or would automatically commit Australia to participation in that war. Nor do they mean that action taken by a government of the Commonwealth in any and every set of circumstances, and leading to war, should or would automatically commit the United Kingdom to participation in that war. It is conceivable that upon either side a policy might be adopted which met with strong disapproval or condemnation by the other government. But in the circumstances in which the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the Commonwealth find themselves to-day there is no sort of disagreement. On the contrary, there is the most complete unanimitybetween the two governments as to the policy which is being followed, and as to any action which may arise out of that policy. The Commonwealth Government is fully satisfied that recent actions and the prevailing dispositions and certain preliminary moves of the totalitarian nations of Europe constitute a near and grave menace not only to the United Kingdom, but also to Australia and to the democracies of the world as a whole and to all institutions and traditions that stand for freedom. This Government has been fully advised of everystep taken by the Government of the United Kingdom, and fully consulted throughout the long and perilous ordeal of the last few years, including the last few weeks. The Commonwealth Government is satisfied beyond any doubt that the United Kingdom and the democracies associated with it have no intention other than one that is purely defensive against aggression. If, therefore, in pursuance of this policy, the Government of Britain is at any moment plunged into war, this Government will, on behalf of the Australian people, make common cause with the Mother Country in that war. Motion (by Mr. Menzies) - by leave - agreed to. That Standing Order No. 119 be suspended to enable the debate to proceed without interruption.","17"
"KFS","No.","12"
"009FQ","I have said so repeatedly. I am glad that this afternoon, in the most unequivocal way, a statement on behalf of the Government and a statement on behalf of the Opposition can bo so reconciled as to establish the 'responsibility of the Australian Government, and of no other government, for the people of Australia being engaged in war. The Opposition welcomes the proposals of the Government to extend the activities of the Department of External Affairs so that Australia will be able to discharge its responsibilities in the light of information which will be supplied by its own officers. I have already said that I have the greatest respect for the other sources of information by which the department is equipped to understand the international situation. In my opinion, the proposal to establish a legation at Washington is a good one. It will put Australia in direct touch with a country in which there are 130,000,000 people who speak the English language and, like ourselves, have their roots back in the history and the traditions of the British race, and, I venture to say, have also a common concern in respect of civilization. To the extent to which the separate parts of the English-speaking race understand one another's problems, there is a oneness which seems to me to be a definite contribution towards the strength of each and, in turn, can be said to be of service ultimately to peace, for I believe that the United States of America is as unwilling to act aggressively as is Australia. I venture also to say that as the problems of the Pacific are problems which, in the nature of things, are closer to us than are those of Europe, it would be desirable for an Australian legation to be established in China. There ought also to be n representative of the Australian Commonwealth located in New Zealand. If, in addition, Australia's representation at Washington were reinforced by a branch office at San Francisco, we should have a more extended representation of Australia than has 'been the case hitherto. I believe that that would be a good thing. The honorable gentleman said that he believes that, insinuated into all discussions in respect of the recent crises, there has been reflected the ardent and almost pathetic desire and prayer for peace. I firmly believe that the workers of every country will echo that statement with the deepest feeling. There can be no workers anywhere in the world, either in Germany, Italy or Japan, or in any other country, who can have anything at all to gain as the result of the settlement of such disputes as exist by recourse to war. Therefore, the efforts for peace-making which are going on throughout the world can, I venture to say, be furthered by demonstrations on the part of the democracies, that democratic institutions can lift up the level of the mass of the people much more satisfactorily than can totalitarian States. We have to give proof that democracy is in itself a form of government that not only dislikes war, but also ministers to the high hopes and aspirations of mankind. Therefore, the spectacle of large masses of unemployed in Great Britain and in the United States of America, and of a considerable unemployment problem in Australia, and other evidence of this character, weakens the approach of the democracies to the masses of Germany and Italy, and even of Japan. They learn that democratic systems do not -necessarily mean work and food and decent living standards, and, therefore, they are warranted, not in contrasting the speeches of the leaders of other countries with the declarations of their own leaders, but in measuring up how far the form of political system that they have accepted yields to them a more satisfactory internal social standing than does the democratic system. Therefore, the approach that the people of one country makes to those of another in respect of the ideological causes of war, such as the opposition expressed in this statement to the forms of government in Italy, Japan and Germany, cannot in itself be so effective as it otherwise would be while the democracies present the spectacle of an incapacity to resolve their own internal problems. Thus the philosophy of peace abroad, I venture to say, has to be reinforced by determined endeavours on the part of the governments of the democracies to lift up the standards of their own people, to overcome the problem of unemployment, the problem of scarcity of houses and of inequality between the rising cost of living and rates of wages. That is not only a necessary thing to do from the point of view of preserving our own system of government; in a consideration of international problems and in measuring how far the forms of government do, or do not, serve the best interests of the people everywhere we must also inevitably do far better than we have done before we can expect the people of other countries to believe that democracy is the precious system of government we hold it to be. The German dictatorship, according to one part of the honorable gentleman's statement, involves the people of Germany in being veritable slaves, and yet, according to another part of it, they are on the eve of a period of great glory. The same observations apply also to Italy.","17"
"009FQ","And so are we on the eve of a period of great glory if honorable gentlemen opposite would carry out even a portion of the undertakings which they entered into with the people prior to the last general election. During the last four years the atmosphere in the world has been prejudiced by the partisanship and, to some extent, the uncontrolled propaganda which vested interests have let loose. The efforts of the British Government in its negotiations for peace were to some extent made, difficult by the partisan activities of those who are more concerned, as it were, with fighting Hitler than with establishing peace. There is unquestionably in the world a class that has a vested interest in war and in war-making, and the propagandist activities which are employed in the interests of this exploiting and ruthless class, which is international in character, have made difficulties for all governments, including, I believe, the governments of the dictators. As the result we have had the spectacle of what Australia thinks about the international situation repeatedly stated in this country both by newspapers and over wireless stations in a way which has not contributed anything towards the settlement of the problem, but has contributed to the inflammation of hysteria among the Australian body politic. I have no proposals to make for the suppression of public opinion, nor do I desire to silence those who disagree with me; however, in this era in which the world has stupendous problems to resolve and in which, particularly in the democracies, the leaders of nations cannot do the right thing merely because it is the right thing, but can only do it when they have the support and concurrence of their own people, it is not a service to democracy if ill-founded accusations are made and scares engendered by those who have no responsibility to the people as a people, but who for the mo3t part parade such stunts in order to satisfy either their own or some related interests. To the extent that anything can be said in this Parliament which will put a, curb upon utterances which have been prejudical to the understanding of Australia's attitude towards the problems of either Europe or Asia, it may be that more frequent discussions of foreign policy in this House may have some effect. I prefer the positive remedy of honest and straight declarations as to where Australia stands, or proposes to stand, being made on behalf of the Australian people, to newspaper editorials or wireless commentaries. This observation is also true in respect of other countries. It is important that Australia's position should be made known to the world, and I can see no reason why Australians should listen to German broadcasts in English without Australia itself taking the initiative so that there can be heard in Germany, Austria, Italy or Japan, in the languages of those countries, declarations as to what Australia thinks ought to be done in the interests of world peace. I repeat that if there should be any remedy at all for the one-sided attitude which marks many pronouncements in all countries to-day it should be positive rather than negative. By that, I mean that rather than suppress opinion we ought to take the responsibility of sponsoring those opinions which responsible authorities in Australia regard as fair statements as to what Australia will do. These could be delivered from short-wave stations in Australia in the languages of the countries to which we desire to address such statements. The fact is that the people of Australia, the workers of Australia, desire peace, and it is not sufficient for that view to be communicated merely to the leaders of other nations, such as Germany or Japan; we must reach the people of those countries if we wish to get from ' them that degree of influence which they can exert upon their own governments, because it is notorious that the chief institution which has to be created once war is unloosed is the lie factory which can whip up the patriotism of one's own people and create unrest and disquietude in the ranks of the enemy. The last four years of crisis have, from the point of view of the world at large, been much worse than they need have been had the people of the various countries any true conception of what the people of other countries were really thinking. We in Australia have long been accustomed to the influencewhich public opinion can exert over governments and dictators of policies of political parties, and it is right and proper that such an influence should be exerted in order that Australian public opinion should be heard. In this, the most vital of all considerations - whether the world shall remain at peace or be dragged into war - I, and I believe thousands of Australians, prefer to trust an enlightened public opinion rather than the ambitions of a few political leaders. To the extent that we can encourage the development of an informed and educated understanding in other countries regarding the peaceful intentions of the Australian people and the course they will take in the event of war breaking out, we can determine whether the aggressors are justified in their actions or not.","17"
"KMW","But surely if these are in fact present and undesirable the democracies could overcome them by democratic methods. The elected representatives of the people should be able to overcome any such disabilities if they exist. The ballot box is a power which our people always have at their command. The members of this House are definitely of the opinion that democratic methods are better than dictatorship methods. That is not to say, however, that we should seek to force the people of totalitarian states to discontinue their existing methods. They have a perfect right to adopt whatever system of government appeals to them. Earlier in this debate I heard an honorable member interject that it was now proposed to ally the soviet system of Russia with the democratic system of the British Empire. That is not to say that the British people would deny to the Russian people the right to live under their own system of government. The Russians have a perfect right to live under whichever system of government they choose. What is being said, in effect, is that as an effort is being made to force Poland to accept a system of government which the Poles do not desire, it is desir- able that the governments which believe in peoples having the right to preserve their own systems of government should combine to maintain those rights against other countries which would force a different system of government upon them. The Leader of the Opposition said that if the British Empire got into trouble and war were declared, whether a war of aggression or of defence, the people of this country should have the right to say whether they would participate in it or not. I agree. This Parliament is the voice of the people. But I remind honorable members that, notwithstanding what may be written in the constitutions which so lightly bind the different parts of the British Empire together, if the British Empire is at war Australia is also at war. Whatever the nature of our Constitution, however light the bonds that unite us to the Empire, the fact remains that when the British Empire is at Avar this country also is at Avar, no matter what our Parliament may say or do.","17"
"KMW","We can best strengthen Australia by remaining part and parcel of the British Empire. We can protect and develop Australia only by remaining true to the democratic system of government. It may be true that in social reform we have not ad vanced during the last few years as rapidly as we did during the early days of federation, but surely that is not the fault of this Government. It is the fault of all our governments. Legislation of various kinds which could and should have been introduced for the alleviation of suffering has been held up. Recently, a national health insurance scheme was introduced, but was opposed by the Labour party. One would have thought that the needs of the widows and orphans of Australia would have won their sympathy. The Leader of the Opposition devoted some time to pointing out the shortcomings of the democracies, but I remind him that if we assail democracy we assist dictatorships. Those are the only two practical systems of government operating in the world to-day. While the Minister for External Affairs was reading his statement I heard interjections expressing regret at the inclusion of certain sentences which they thought might be harmful to the peace of the world. I remind those honorable members who interjected that Herr Hitler has never troubled himself to be conciliatory. Surely we have a right to refute his insulting references to the democracies. We believe in democracy as the best system of government under which to live. The German people, for the time being at any rate, appear to believe that a dictatorship is the best system. I am not objecting to their choice of a system of government which they consider suitable for themselves; I am objecting to the attempts of Germany to foist that system upon other countries - to its attempts to subjugate other nations, and impose upon them its own dictatorship. The Leader of the Opposition said that if the dictatorship countries approached the democracies along peaceful lines, the democracies would be delighted to meet them. I agree with that statement, but I point out that no such approach has ever been made. The dictatorship countries have never invited the democracies to sit around the conference table to discuss the problems of the world. The democratic countries, however, have repeatedly asked the leaders of the totalitarian States to meet them in conference, rather than to continue their warlike 'courses. In 1929, a Labour government, under Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, supported by Mr. Arthur Henderson, fought hard to induce the nations of Europe to agree to a reduction of armaments. Every decent man will admit the sincerity of Mr. Arthur Henderson.","17"
"JPN","I am very glad that this House has at last an opportunity to discuss external affairs. On very many occasions honorable members have asked for such an opportunity, but nearly always it has been withheld. 1 regard the position of Australia in relation to the other countries of the world as of tremendous importance. Indeed, 1 cannot conceive of anything that is more important. Domestic, political, and social reforms are all influenced by a state of unrest in the world, a state that will continue if this country, along with others, is to be committed to a policy of preparation for war. The expenditure necessary for that preparation must have the effect of postponing or side-tracking the social reforms which we all so much desire. We shall be told that it is impossible to provide money for the payment of old-age pensions, and for other desirable social services, when the immediate and pressing demand is to prepare for war. War is the bankruptcy of international diplomacy. If war comes, it will be because all the attempts of the diplomatists to avert war have failed. This is of the utmost importance to Australia,1 not merely 'because of its separate position in the world, but particularly -because it is a member of a society of nations - a member of the world community, so that nothing can affect the people of the world that does not' affect us. .It is important to us also because Australia is, by its own choice, a member of a national society, whether we call it the British Empire, as did the honorable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr), or the British Commonwealth of Nations, as did the Minister for External Affairs (Sir Henry Gullett) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin). The party to which I belong h..s registered its determination to remain an inseparable member of that society.' The ink is still fresh on the Federal Conference's declaration that. Labour's defence policy is based upon the fact that Australia is an integral part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. That means that we regard Australia's membership of that, society as permanent' and indestructible- It seems clear to me that what affects that society must affect Australia. We cannot sit by and say that what is done in Great Britain is purely a matter for that country, and cannot have any bearing on us. It is clear that although, in the event of war, we would not be, and could not be compelled to send troops overseas to join in the war, or even to defend ourselves, it still remains true that we must be affected by the fact that Great Britain, as the principal partner in the Commonwealth, is at war. We. could not go on behaving as if we were a separate nation. That position, as a matter of law, is unassailable, and is not weakened by the new internal relationship between Great Britain and the dominions as defined by the preamble to the Statute of Westminster - a preamble which is already law in Australia. In an article published in January of this year in the Canadian Bar Revieu.', Professor W. P. M. Kennedy, one of the most eminent jurists in the British Empire, sets down reluctantly certain conelusions as follows:-","17"
"JPN","Professor Kennedy apparently regrets to come to these conclusions. From these, it follows that Australia, like Canada, cannot exercise control over its external relations and at the same time remain inseparably a part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. If Great Britain is at war, Australia is affected. This country cannot continue to trade with nations which are at enmity with Britain; it cannot act as if there were no war. It cannot allow the vessels of hostile foreign nations to revictual or undergo repairs at Australian ports, lu war, this country will suffer great economic hardships. Therefore, even from the selfish point of view of national security and well-being, it is of tremendous importance to us that we should do all that lies in our power to avert the possibility of armed conflict. I do not believe that Australia is without blame for the state of tension existing in the world to-day. We should make a greater effort to understand the outlook of other peoples, to induce other nations to understand our view, and generally we should adapt our policies to encourage good relations with other nations. We cannot blame any particular party or section of the community for our shortcoming in this matter; we all have erred and gone astray. But I think that Australia, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, can make an important contribution to world peace. I have spoken of this in this House on other occasions. The policy of the British Commonwealth of Nations makes for war. Prior to 1931, although Great Britain was then the chief colonial power, it permitted other nations to enter into the markets of its non-self-governing colonies on equal terms with British trade. It did not attempt to monopolize dominion markets. The governments of the several dominions, up till then, were free to exclude British goods, and did so. That British policy has been deliberately abandoned during the last nine or ten years. Since the making of the Ottawa Agreement, British Empire markets have, to a large extent, been closed to foreign nations. In effect, the Empire has been made 'a closed circuit within which Empire countries seek to trade only with other Empire countries, and within which the trade of the non-self-governing territories has been exploited, not merely by the people of Great Britain and Ireland, but also by the people in the self-governing dominions - in fact by all the constituents of the British Commonwealth of Nations. This is one of the things that tends to war, and it is important to remember that Australia has a voice in determining this policy. It should not be our design or the design of other dominions to monopolize trade with Britain and exploit British territories to the entire exclusion of the peoples of other countries. Britain should itself head a movement of colonial powers to place colonial territories under a system of international control, first with the object of protecting the interests of the native inhabitants and advancing those non-adult people a further stage towards mental adolescence, and secondly, with the object of securing for the peoples of all countries equal right to trade with these colonial territories. It is absurd to think that we can pursue a policy of a closed Empire and yet avoid war. The Minister (Sir Henry Gullett) urged that we should invite other nations to confer with representatives of the British Commonwealth of Nations regarding the grave problems that confront all the powers, and went on to say that their representations would be dealt with in a spirit of generosity. I suggest with great respect to the honorable gentleman, that the only thing that we can do, if we expect our protestations of sincerity to be accepted, is to declare that we shall no longer regard ourselves as privileged to exploit colonial territories; we should, as I have suggested, be prepared, as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, to abandon our position as an imperial nation, to give up those colonies, and place those territories which can govern themselves in a position to do so. The others, the non-self-governing, must be put in a position of tutelage under an international trust. If Britain adopted this plan, and invited the co-operation of the other principal colonial powers, France, Portugal and Holland, it is likely that the invitation would be accepted. Unless this be done, we cannot expect the other nations to believe that we ave anxious to do something definite in the cause of world peace. It is idle to talk about Great Britain being prepared to make peace overtures to other powers if the nation is not willing to make sacrifices in the cause of peace. It is all very well for some people to try to distinguish between what they are pleased to consider is the peace-mindedness of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the non-peace-mindedness of countries that are seeking expansion. It should be remembered that Germany and Italy entered the family of nations in the latter half of last century, and found that nearly everything worth having was already in the possession of other nations. Does any one expect that the governments of those countries, which claim the right to share in the development of colonial territories, will accept for all time a position of inferiority? It is an axiom that if nations are to survive, opportunity must be given for the expansion of trade relations with other countries. What now is the position? As the result of private ownership of the means of production, the world is divided into two classes - the comparatively small class which takes the lion's share of the product, and the large class which has to be content with what it cannot live without. Thus, in each industrialized country, the masses of the people were denied the means of buying and consuming their product. Thus, in each such country the owing class was left with a surplus over local consumption. The problem thus created was not acute before all the nations became as highly industrialized as they are to-day, because as exports or investments the surplus could be disposed of overseas. But since practically every country has, in more recent years, been endeavouring to become economically self sufficient, the world's markets for imports have contracted, and in some cases have disappeared. What must happen in a country which cannot, without abandoning its social organization, feed its people? Germany and Italy, like Britain and France, are wedded to the capitalist system of private ownership of production; and like Britain and France, the totalitarian powers can provide for the needs of their people in only one way, namely, by devoting a very large portion of their surplus funds to capital expenditure upon public works, and especially upon the preparation for war. Therefore, preparation for war becomes an essential part of the social and industrial life of the capitalist nations. Countries that are prepared for war will sooner or later go to war. That is inevitable. It is unfortunately true that most nations are to-day organized, not for peace, but for war. The causes of war, in my view, are produced in the present world economic system, but they can be made less potent, because wars cannot be made without men, or the co-operation of members of the human race, and the instinct of human beings, regardless of differences of race, religion, language or institutions, is to live at peace. The only thing that will distract men from the will to live at peace is the belief that they cannot live without war. The people of Germany have been taught that they cannot secure for themselves a place in the sun. Towards the end of the Great War their ' will to war ' was broken down by assurances given to them that if they overthrew their system of government and dethroned the Kaiser they would be readmitted to the comity of nations. They did so, but they were not re-admitted. The only sure way to peace is for the people of the British races to negotiate with the German people to-day, and to show a willingness to meet them on such terms that everybody will be able to live in security and enjoy the good things of this world upon an equal footing. The alignment of democracies against the totalitarian states does not worry the hungry man. He can be just as bungey, unhappy, . and miserable in London or Paris as in Berlin or Rome, or, for that matter, in Melbourne or Sydney; the system of government he lives under is not, to him, the allimportant consideration. No great difference' exists between democracies and totalitarian states. In the democracies of Britain, France and the United States of America the people have votes; but that system of government works within the limits of constitutions. The people governed by them move and have their being iu a political atmosphere that is created or de-natured by wealth. Everything that they hear and know is only what the wealthy organizations that control public opinion are prepared to let them hear and know. There is no great difference between Mr. Chamberlain and Herr Hitler. They are more in agreement than are the people they represent, because each is determined that his state shall have its place in the sun and that his power shall be paramount. Mr. Chamberlain is resolved that the power of the class which rules Great Britain shall be the maximum and that it shall not give up one shred, and Hitler is equally determined that Germany shall tear from weaker and decadent nations the things which those nations can no longer hold. As constituent parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations, we ourselves' have, individually and collectively, some responsibility for the conditions that exist in this world. 'We shall be able to justify these debates and help to make the world a better place if we make a genuine appeal for peace to the people of other countries. I believe that such an appeal would bear fruit, but even if the worst should happen, we should know that we were not entirely to blame, because, we had tried, even at the eleventh hour, to remove the causes of war. The state of stifled war in which we live to-day, and there is no doubt that it exists, is an extraordinary danger to our representative institutions. When negotiations are in progress between two nations, one of which allows no minority to have a voice in its affairs and allows no questioning of its leaders whilst the other permits a minority to have an active voice, and its public men to be questioned by members of Parliament, it is obvious that a totalitarian nation has a tremendous advantage over a democratic country. So it seems to me that if the present state of war continues in the world, we shall find that Great Britain, the United States of America, France and Australia will preserve merely the outside semblance of representative institutions, for the real substance of it will have been taken away; minority opinion will be suppressed in France, the United States of America and Australia as really and as substantially as it has been suppressed in Berlin, Moscow, or Rome.- If we desire to make our representative institutions real things, if we have any real belief in democracy, we must be anxious for peace, and must be prepared to make sacrifices for peace. Unless the people of Australia are prepared to make sacrifices for peace and, as constituent members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, try to induce the peoples of that Commonwealth also to make sacrifices, I believe that there will be war, not necessarily to-morrow, but sooner or later. Every day, every hour .that we gain from war is a day or an hour saved, in which we may do something towards the pacification of the world.","17"
"KIX","At the outset, I congratulate the Government upon the initiation of a debate on foreign affairs in this House. In the past, the Government- of the day has adopted what I might term ' a hush-hush policy' on foreign affairs, with the result that time and again matters pertaining to foreign policy or the motions for the printing of papers dealing with 'international affairs have been relegated to a very low position in the list of orders of the day. I believe that foreign affairs should assume in this House, as they do in the House of Commons, an importance possibly not second to any other subject which engages our attention. Of late years the Australian people have been awakened to a great degree by the space which the press has devoted to foreign affairs, and also by the time allowed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to speakers dealing with that subject. But even so, it still remains for this 'House to play a most important part in the education of the Australian people in respect of foreign countries and of foreign relations generally. I consider that, at the moment, the people of this Commonwealth are somewhat insular and narrow in their views concerning foreign affairs. On no other ground can one account for a policy such as that of isolation, for which the Opposition stands, being placed prominently before the Australian people. If we are to extend the vision of our citizens, we must endeavour to provide leadership and to form public opinion from within this chamber. It is for this reason that I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) upon his intention to make debates on foreign affairs a regular feature of our proceedings. One finds it difficult to choose out of the mass of information available to us which subjects to debate. The world stage is changing so rapidly that it may be said that every- day witnesses a new scene, and the world wonders what the final act of the play is to be. I shall commence my remarks by addressing a few words to those people particularly who would adopt a pacifist 'attitude in relation to the present activity in the manufacture of armaments in Australia and overseas. I would say to them that the Australian people, and British peoples generally, cannot judge foreign peoples according to their own standard; there are such wide differences of view, of environment, and of civilization among the countries of Europe that we cannot regard as their standards those that we enjoy. This is borne out by the very fact that great and populous countries in Europe have been content to place themselves under what I might almost describe as the iron heel of one man. It has been stated this afternoon that the internal economic conditions of those countries are in the nature of a challenge to the economic conditions of Australia. I should say in reply that in some of the totalitarian countries unemployment has supposedly ceased to exist, only because of definitely low wages and conditions which would not be tolerated by the people of this country. According to the utterances of most of the leaders of the different countries of the world, rearmament is taking place in the interests of world peace. We have also the knowledge that whilst it is true that we are rearmingand I believe that we must - in the cause of peace, it is also true, paradoxical though it be, that a world in arms is definitely a factor contributing towards war. Thus the situation which faces us, from 'both points of view, is uncertain. We have to ask ourselves why such a situation has arisen. I believe it is chiefly because power politics, as we have come to know them, have 'been successful ever since the termination of the last great war. So successful have they been that when Germany and Italy came under the control of dictators, those dictators instantly adopted this policy as the one most likely to prove profitable for themselves.","17"
"KIX","Is it any wonder that the prestige of the democratic countries has declined throughout the world and that Britons everywhere are afraid that weakness and vacillation may yet create a war which could be averted by a strong policy? During recent months the Government of Great Britain has adopted a policy more acceptable to me, and -I hope that there will be no weakening of it. During this discussion, it has been suggested that the great powers should meet in conference. I agree that that would be a proper course to pursue if reliance could be placed on the word of the participants. It is well to bear in mind what Hitler thinks of round-ta'ble conferences and negotiations. Will any honorable member say that he has shown any desire to meet other nations in round-table discussions free from a background of force i:o supplement his. arguments? We can possibly find some idea of his attitude towards negotiations in Mein Kampf, wherein he said that from the Jews 'he learned that a definite factor in getting a lie believed is the size of the lie '. The result has been a succession of lies. I shall give one or two examples.","17"
"KIX","Possibly not, and that is all the greater reason why we should realize the true position. On the 30th January, 1934, speaking in the Reichstag, Herr Hitler, referring to the Saar, said -","17"
"KIX","Not long afterwards, Germany militarized the Rhineland. Again, on the 21st May, 1935, Herr Hitler, in an address to the Reichstag, said -","17"
"KIX","We all know what happened to Austria. After the Munich Agreement, he said - :","17"
"KIX","Within a few months Germany had completely absorbed Czechoslovakia. If honorable members .believe that we can negotiate satisfactorily with men who have adopted the 'big lie' as their policy, they are making a great mistake. Before we can engage in discussions around the table, there must he definite evidence of honesty and sincerity. So far, Germany has not given evidence of honesty. In regard to foreign affairs generally, we in this country cannot formulate a policy which is in opposition to that of the best interests of the British Empire. But we can say - and on this the whole basis of the unity of the Empire depends - that we have a right to be consulted and to be supplied with all available information, so that we may confer with other portions of the Empire in arriving at a common policy. It was, therefore, with great joy that I heard the Minister say to-day that all the information that is obtained hy the Foreign Office in London is telegraphed immediately to the dominions. Only by formulating .a policy in consultation with other parts of the Empire can we hope to succeed. I hope that in the formulation of Empire policy there will be a stiffening of the attitude previously adopted by the British Government, a determination not to yield another foot in Europe, for I am firmly of the opinion that any yielding in respect of Danzig or the Polish corridor will be regarded by other countries as evidence of weakness, and by the dictator countries as an incentive to make even greater demands. Any one who has travelled abroad, particularly on the Continent, knows of the belief widely current in some countries that the British people are becoming decadent. That opinion must not be allowed to gain ground. I welcome the announcement that in the future Australia will play a much greater part in eastern affairs than formerly. It may be said that Western affairs are largely outside Australia's ambit; but the East is almost at our door. It is only right that in the formulation of policy connected with the East and the Pacific Ocean, Australia should play a major part. The decision to establish legations at Tokio and Washington is a matter for congratulation. There is great need for. a broader conception of foreign affairs on the part of the Australian people. On . many occasions in the past I was told that New Guinea might just as well be in the hands of a European power, as, in that event, there would be another great power in the Pacific in the event of war, but during recent years I have not heard that opinion expressed. To-day, Australians regard New Guinea as a place of great strategic importance to the Commonwealth. Indeed, there are many who urge the fortification of that territory in order to prevent it from becoming the base for aggressive action against Australia. That altered opinion is evidence of an enlarged vision, but there is need for an even wider outlook. Australian interests are not confined to this continent and the waters surrounding it. This country's trade is with all parts of the world, much of it passing through the Mediterranean Sea or around the Cape of Good Hope. If our trade relations with other countries are to be maintained and our standard of living not . lowered, we in this country must realize our obligations in respect of certain strategic points long distances from our own shores. Earl Baldwin once said that Britain's frontier had shifted to the Rhine, and more recently some one has claimed that it has shifted further east to the Vistula. Similarly, Australia's frontier can certainly be said to extend as far as Singapore, and possibly, further. That being so, Australia must be vitally interested in anything that affects India, the Suez Canal, Palestine and the Netherlands East Indies. The control of those places is of vital interest . to - us. I emphasize the great importance of the Mediterranean Sea; through it much of our trade is carried and from that quarter . help must come in the event of attack on Australia. I stress, therefore, the need for a wider vision, not only in regard to New Guinea, but also in regard to Singapore, and other strategic points. The honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) stressed the fact that trade relations are inseparably linked with the present world situation. The Government should realize that its trade policy and its foreign policy must harmonize. To-day's newspapers contain references to a huge programme of industrial expansion in Australia. It would appear to be a policy similar to that which had led to such dire consequences in Europe- a policy of economic nationalism. That policy is as old as the hills. Napoleon adopted it, and was wrecked by it. It is a policy which will definitely endanger the peace of the world if allowed to continue. By all means let us develop our industries, but, at the same time, let us make sure that our trade activities do not run counter to our foreign policy. We should guard against placing any obstacle in the way of friendly relations with those countries whose co-operation we need so urgently at present. During the last few months the defence ' and security of Australia have been definitely enhanced by the transfer of the American Fleet from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The very fact that the Government intends to establish a legation at Washington is a sufficient indication that it fully realizes the value to Australia of the goodwill of the people of the United States of America. In all our dealings with that country, we must make it clear that not only is its trade of great advantage to us, but also that Australia's market is of considerable value to it. I say again that the Government should ensure that in its industrial and trade activities it will do nothing that will run counter to a sound foreign policy. As I said earlier, we have the paradox of mobilizing our armed forces whilst sincerely desiring the maintenance of peace. At present we can take only one line of action; until the dictators give some definite proof of their bona fides, we can follow no other course than counter force with force. Let us- hope that before long such an indication will be given. Until then, however, the only line of action open to us is to strengthen our defences to such an extent as to make aggression against us a hazardous venture. We have better prospects of preventing war by adopting a firm foreign policy than by pursuing a vacillating and weak one. That is the only effective course open to us at present. Let us hope that before long signs will appear on the international horizon that the leaders of the nations are prepared in genuine humility to sit in conference with the object of discovering a way out of the present impasse that will guarantee the peace of the world.","17"
"KZ9","I am very disappointed with the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs (Sir Henry Gullett) on international relations, because it has proved to he only a resume of what we have already read in the press. The honorable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson) declared that the influence of the democracies has declined, but he did not say why, or how, that had occurred. The honorable member would be enlightened on this point if he read some of the books and publications now being published on the subject. I wholeheartedly support the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin). In the course of his speech, the honorable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) referred to Hitler, and when I asked him who was the power behind Hitler he replied that he did not know. That is a very significant admission by an honorable gentleman who claims respect as one of the legislators of the Commonwealth. I shall answer that question for him when, in my humble way, I deal with the factors which are responsible for the present unsettled international position. Previous speakers have discussed international events and have suggested certain remedies, but we have not yet been told of the hidden forces which are responsible for the present world unrest. When future generations study the history of this era they will marvel at the gullibility and credulity of the peoples of the world in allowing certain sections to get away with what they are ' putting over ' the people at the present time. Dealing with the factors which have led up to the present position, I refer first to the great awakening which came to a very small section of the community, the international financial manipulators, as the result of the financial crisis of 1907. That minority then realized that something would have to be done to prevent the control of the present economic order from slipping out of ite hands. In these circumstances Paul Warburg, an American banker, propounded a scheme which, fortunately for the world, was not accepted by the financial dictators of the United States of America. However, in 1913 that scheme was resurrected and implemented by the financial magnates of that country, and its adoption resulted in the establishment of the Federal Reserve Board. In regard to that 'body I cannot do better than quote the opinion of Sir Josiah Stamp, a director of the Bank of England, and one of the leading economists of the world, who, in an interview published in the National Bank Monthly for February, 1926, said -","17"
"KZ9","In his book, America Conquers Britain, published in 1930, Mr. Ludwell Denny wrote -","17"
"KZ9","Many nations may laugh at our State Department, but all must tremble before our Federal Reserve Board..... High money rates in the United States of America early in 1929, for instance, forced an increase in the official discount rates at once in ' England, ten European countries, in two Latin-American -countries, and two in the Far East, and in almost every ease that action restricted business and brought suffering to millions of foreign workers. That blow hit Britain hardest of all. It checked trade revival.","17"
"KZ9","These statements clearly reveal a situation in which, by legislative enactment, this body is enabled to hold in its palm the welfare not only of the United States of America, but also of the whole world. This fact has been realized by so eminent a banking authority as .Mr; Ludwell Denny. There is ample evidence that considerable differences existed between the financial interests of Great Britain and those of the United States of America. As the result of such differences an international conference of bankers was held at Brussels in 1919 with the object of rehabilitating world conditions, and devising means whereby thousands of men demobilized from the armies of the world could be re-absorbed in industry. That conference recommended a policy of deflation. Its recommendation was adopted by some of the smaller nations, but the United States of America refused to have anything to do with it and, consequently, reaped a rich harvest. In 1928, however, came the crash in Wall-street, a catastrophe which was brought about more or less by those interests which control the present economic order. Turning to the financial control of Germany I quote the following remarks by Sir Oswald Stoll in his Freedom in Finance : -","17"
"KZ9","Dealing with the German banking system the same writer says -","17"
"KZ9","The deflationist policy which followed the Wall-street crash produced chaotic conditions in every country. It was responsible for the smashing of wage rates, the deterioration of working conditions, and the increase of unemployment to unheard-of records. It also had the effect of great numbers of people rushing to join the trade unions in different parts of Europe. The workers' organizations of France, Germany and the United States of America became powerful, and their numerical strength attained new limits. This new factor had to be faced by those who controlled the financial institutions. An attack was subsequently made upon the workers' organizations of the United States of America, but it was repelled because President Roosevelt gave to the industrial organizations of that country greater status and power than they had prior to the deflationary period. The German trade unions, also well entrenched when Hitler took control of the destinies of Germany, were, however, faced with a recrudescence of the military spirit. This spirit had been systematically- developed in the people of Germany for many years. Unfortunately, the few years when militarism seemed to be declining proved to . be only a lull. The ' brown shirts ' began to appear in the streets of German cities, and, by using the cry that the Versailles Treaty had wrecked the German nation, they secured the support of large numbers. It was not long before the Nazi party dominated the German Parliament; its leader was enabled to take control of the affairs of the nation, and alter the method of representation in that democratic institution, the German Parliament, just as a few years previously the loader of the Fascist party in Italy, supported by wealthy financial institutions, had taken control in that country, and altered the method of election to the Italian Parliament. Following the coming into power of the Nazi leaders, German wage rates were smashed, and the living conditions of the people destroyed. Many thousands of Germans were forced into concentration camps, and the leaders of the German trade union movement were either gaoled or shot. The emergence of these conditions demonstrated to the world at large that -the German Nazi party was definitely opposed to the German workers, and was supported by the vested interests which are the natural enemies of the working class of every country. So we see that in Italy and Germany vested interests assumed control of the affairs of the nations, with the result that both countries were soon armed to the teeth. The . ultimate objective, of course, is to form a Nazi or Fascist bloc, and make Europe a Fascist State. An important step to this end is the encirclement of France by the Fascist and Nazi powers of Italy, Spain and Germany. By this means it is hoped to smash the strong trade union movement of France, which has made such great progress that not long ago the Socialist party formed the Government of that country for a brief period. This Fascist bloc is undoubtedly designed to destroy trade unionism first in France and ultimately throughout the world. By such a process France would gradually become a totalitarian state. If that should happen Great Britain will find itself faced with a Fascist Europe. The purpose of all this is, undoubtedly, to enable Fascist Europe to attack Communist Russia. Whether the form of government in Russia is right or wrong, according to our views, does not matter. The fact we have to face is that the European Nazi bloc is being formed wholly and solely to oppose Russia and to throw the world into a war. When the Munich Pact was signed last year we all were very thankful that the war had been staved off: but it appears that the totalitarian states are determined that the nations of Europe shall be lined up in opposition to Russia, because vested interests are bitterly opposed to the economic system of Russia. That system, of course,, is different from the economic system of the rest of the civilized world. The Nazi and Russian systems of industry cannot operate side by side. Therefore there must ultimately be a conflict. We all know that Czechoslovakia, which was brought under the domination of Germany last year, had a military alliance with Russia. France, and also England, to some extent, had entered into obligations to support Czechoslovakia. This was the situation when the crisis in world affairs occurred last September. We were not told at that time by the press of this country, nor have we been told since the signing of the Munich Pact, that on the 10th May last year, four months before the September crisis, a dinner was given at the London residence of Viscountess Astor to representatives of the American press for the express purpose of enabling them to be introduced to the Prime Minister of Great Britain. At that dinner, the British Prime Minister told the press representatives that Czechoslovakia was to be handed over to Germany. Although these facts have never been revealed in -the press of this country they are irrefutable. On Saturday, the 14th May, the New York Times published an article by its outside contributor ' Augur ' to the effect that the dinner to which I have referred actually took place and that the Prime Minister had stated that Czechoslovakia was . to be handed to Germany. On the same day Mr. Joseph Driscoll, 'in an article in the Montreal Daily Star, informed the people of Canada that it was the intention of the Chamberlain Government to connive at the handing over of Czechoslovakia to Germany. Shortly after these press reports were published, a discussion on the subject occurred in the British House of Commons and the Prime Minister denied that any interview took place. He said that there could be no suggestion of such an interview. Viscountess Astor made a personal explanation on this subject in the House of Commons on the 27th June. She said -","17"
"KZ9","Other facts have also come to light concerning the Munich Pact which cause us to have grave doubts whether it is really the godsend that we thought it was at the time it was made. I was under the impression, from what I had read in the press, that the British Prime Minister was accompanied by only a small party of officials when he went to Munich; but it is now revealed that Lord Londonderry, the chairman of the Conservative party in Great Britain, also went to Munich. Forty-four other members of the House of Lords went to Nuremburg to meet Hitler during the congress. We also learn now that at a conference held at Kiel in Germany, in 1938, three months before the Munich conference, a number of banking officials, railway directors and other captains of industry from Great Britain met General Goering and other German army leaders. There is in England an Anglo-German Fellowship pro-Fascist in its outlook. It was made clear that this fellowship was something really worth cultivating in the interests of Germany. Sir Thomas Moore, an official of the Anglo-German Fellowship, wrote in the Sunday Despatch -","17"
"KZ9","If those statements mean anything at all they mean that the disaster that we thought to be inevitable last September has only been postponed. It appears to be quite certain that vested interests in the different countries of the world intend to force the workers of all .nations to go to war. I wish to make it quite clear that personally I am opposed to all forms of force, but I think it is high time that what took place prior to and at Munich should be revealed to the general public. The Lyons Government adopted a ' hush-hush ' policy, and did everything possible to prevent honorable members from discussing these subjects. The Menzies Government, we should remember, consists of practically the same team with a new captain. Apparently it expects U9 to accept as gospel everything that it states and everything that appears in the newspapers. Herr Hitler, in his last speech, declared that much of the enmity that existed throughout the world to-day was due to press propaganda. It is obvious to me that the news wÂ« get in the press is not all the news, but only what the editors choose to publish. The totalitarian states have been constituted with one objective, namely, to stage a war against Russia. I maintain that what takes place in Russia is the concern of the Russians, just as what takes place in Australia is the concern of the Australians, and what takes place in France and England is the concern of Frenchmen and Englishmen respectively. The immediate concern of the dictatorships when they were established was to create work for the vast army of unemployed who were walking the streets, an army which if it had continued to be unemployed, must have become a grave danger to the existing order. The first objective of the dictatorships was to stave off the threatened revolution. Then the totalitarian states were to be aimed, and the second objective was to be an attack upon the Russian Government. The third objective was the making of millions of pounds by the armament ring, which is part and parcel of the financial ring that controls the destinies of the world to-day. A great change has come over the European scene. Austria was handed over to Germany without a blow being struck. Czechoslovakia was seized by Germany,* notwithstanding the fact that Czechoslovakia had expended over Â£80,000,000 on armaments, and that its people were armed to the teeth, and prepared to die in defence of their country. In spite of the existence of alliances, no one came to the assistance of that country, and it had to bow to the will of Germany. Then it was Poland's turn, and immediately Germany formulated demands against that country. This time, however, there was a different story to tell. Great Britain and France backed the independence of Poland. It seemed that Hitler, because of the assistance he had given to Franco in Spain, was likely to receive great favours from that gentleman. It is proposed that the territory of Ceuta in North Africa might he handed over to Germany, and if that were done it is possible that Britain's vital line of communication with the East would be threatened, if not severed. Another fly in the ointment was that Hitler had broken with the old, conservative methods of finance, and had embarked upon a policy of internal credits, something which was opposed to the interests of the international financial ring. Moreover, Hitler had inherited the idea of carrying out the old Bismarck plan of expansion to the south-east through the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey, Persia, and on to India. Thus the interests, and even the very existence, of the British Empire might be threatened. There followed an understanding between Britain, France and Poland. But where was Russia in all this? I am not speaking as a Communist, or as one holding a brief for Russia, but as one who is opposed to war. Russia has made no move because Russia realizes that if Poland falls, the attack on Russia will not be far off. We, as individuals, are small pawns in the game of international politics. In this world more consideration is given to wealth than to human life. If war is staved off for ever, as I hope it will be, then the stand taken by the Chamberlain Government will go down in history as one of the greatest events that has. ever occurred in the history of the world. All Australians desire to live at peace with the rest of the world, so that this country may work out its own destiny. It is our fervent hope to continue to make Australia a country worth living in, a country worthy of its place as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.","17"
"JTY","I propose to address myself to the subject of international relations, a subject concerning which we have heard singularly little during the course of this debate. We have heard much concerning matters which have little to do with international relations, 'but very little concerning the present condition of international affairs in Europe and the Pacific, and still less concerning the Government's attitude to international problems as they affect Australia. Certain points must be borne in mind when we are endeavouring to size up the attitude of one country, or group of countries, to the problems of international relationship, or the attempts made to secure by diplomatic pressure the objectives which countries have in view. These points may be classed under five main headings. A country may desire to maintain the status quo by its own influence, or by working in conjunction with certain allies; it may desire to secure an alteration of the status quo; it may desire to prevent another country from securing such an alteration; it may desire to compel another power to observe the status quo; or it may desire to assist another power to secure alterations of the status quo It is necessary that we should take into account the means by which the present relationship between the various countries, particularly of Europe, was brought about, and in order to do that we must go back to a time before the 1914 clash. There was a period of international animosity, accompanied by the building up of armaments throughout Europe and, to a lesser extent, in Asia. There is no need to go into the causes of the Great War, which became known as a war to end war. I can only say that we succeeded in closing that war by signing a peace to end peace. It has become evident that, since the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles, we have experienced a period of disquietude, uncertainty and unrest which was only equalled by the similar period which followed the close of the Napoleonic wars, and continued to 1848 or 1849. There are two methods of arriving at a peace after the cessation of hostilities. One is by the negotiation of peace, and the other is by the dictation of peace. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I believe that the history of the world has proved that it is far better to negotiate a peace, even though one be the victor in a Avar, than for the conqueror to impose his will arbitrarily upon the vanquished. That has been amply borne out by the experience of Europe during the last twenty years. The occupation of the Rhineland by foreign troops, the taking away of certain areas from what were previously the German and Austrian empires, as well as the seizure of territory belonging to Bulgaria and Turkey without consultation with what was left of the governments of those countries, and certainly without consulting, except to a very limited degree, the wishes of the people concerned, have led to a state of affairs which can be remedied only by the negotiation of new treaties, or by a clash of arms, so that force may bring about what diplomacy has failed to achieve. Arising also out of the Treaty of Versailles is, on the one hand, the present relationship of Great Britain to the dominions and, on the other, the collective relationship of the British Commonwealth of Nations to the world generally. Prior to the world war, there was only one diplomatic channel of communication between the British Empire and other countries, namely, the Foreign Office in London. Since the war. the various British dominions have evolved their own foreign policies, and have established their own diplomatic contacts with foreign countries. Now it is proposed that Australia shall appoint diplomatic representatives at Washington and Tokyo. That can be but the beginning of such a policy; it cannot be the end of this venture into the realm of diplomacy. Other countries have claims upon our attention just as logical, even if not as urgent, as those of Japan and the United States of America, and eventually, if we are to pursue this course, we must appoint, diplomatic representatives to them also. Thus we shall become involved in a comprehensive and expensive system of oversea, representation. Much has been said during the course of this debate regarding fascism and communism. The soil on which those plants grow is only, to be found in countries which have been beaten to their knees by warfare, either successful or unsuccessful. Alike in victorious ' Italy and defeated Germany and Hungary, the conditions brought about by war produced the fallow upon which the crops of communism and fascism were able to grow. It stands to reason that if further hostilities occur in this troubled part of Europe they will be attended by devastating results to all countries. It was only by the exercise of such power as we had over Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey that these smaller countries were brought out of the gutter, so to speak, and placed upon their feet. Poverty, defeat and despair had been their lot. There is a tendency to endeavour to secure a line-up of powers throughout the world. In March last we saw reference to this in a section of the Australian press. One newspaper in Sydney, I think it was the Daily Telegraph - and I suggest that the initial letters for that publication, might well have stood for something else at the time - endeavoured to build a line-up of what are called the democratic and dictator powers. And among the- democratic powers mentioned I noticed with some surprise the .names of such countries as Russia, Roumania and Yugoslavia. On this aspect I can only say that if there is a tendency on the part of this Parliament to take part in a line-up of that description and in the 'manner indicated by that newspaper the outlook for the people of this country will he indeed hopeleas. Personally, I believe that the only countries in Europe which to-day can lay claim to be under democratic governments are Britain and France, the three Scandinavian powers, Finland and the Low Countries, with, possibly, some of those small States east of the Baltic. Among the dictator powers are such countries as Russia, Germany, Italy, Yugoslavia, Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Spain. There is no suggestion that there is to be a line up of powers, the democracies on one side and the dictatorships on the other. The line up is going to be according to their grievances and their desires for territorial and trade expansion. It is not going to be on the basis of the governments they keep in power. A good deal has been said lately about what are termed aggressor and nonaggressor powers. What really constitutes an aggressor power? The his.tory of some of the European democracies, particularly the great colonial powers of Britain, France, Holland and perhaps also Portugal and Spain, is such that it would he interesting to discover when acquisition of colonial territories ceased to be what is now regarded as aggression. It stands to reason that the people living in many of the territories now under the control of Great Britain, for example, were not asked whether they 'wished to become subjects of the British Empire, or whether they preferred to remain in undisturbed possession of the countries in which they lived. There is no doubt that, under present conditions, the manner in which Great Britain acquired some of its colonies would to-day be called by the much nastier term of aggression, though I am aware that, at the present time, it is not quite fashionable to look some facts in the face.","17"
"JTY","Force always prevails. There is no greater exponent of force than honorable members of the Labour party. The recording, of votes at the ballot-box is a display of force - the assertion of the power of the majority. Democracy rests on force of numbers and on nothing else. Another line-up during recent years has been on the basis of the ' Have ' and the 'Have-not' powers. Some countries have great colonial possessions; others have none. Personally I doubt whether the ownership of colonies is at all times an advantage to the country which has acquired them. Sometimes they may bc an embarrassing burden. But I can understand the attitude of those people who look at the map of the world, and, seeing great colonies held by European countries small in area - Britain, France, Belgium - think that this ownership confers great benefits upon the country owning them, and that the unequal distribution can be overcome only by methods that I shall not discuss to-night. Then there is the subject of grievances. We shall not get a clear understanding of what is wrong in Europe until we have investigated the grievances under which the governments of the various countries believe their people to be suffering. Let us consider first the position of Poland, one of the great European powers with which we are endeavouring to make an alliance. The people of that country, so far as I can understand the situation, ought to be more than a satisfied community- But against Poland Germany certainly has grievances. Incorporated in Poland is the free city of Danzig, with an entirely German population, and a strip of country known as the Corridor, which, while giving Poland access to the sea, severs Germany from East Prussia. .It includes former German areas containing valuable mineral deposits and the highly industrialized Upper Silesia which is German in every respect. Thus it will be seen that Germany has grievances which may well lead to an armed conflict with its neighbour, Poland. These difficulties can only be overcome by methods which I shall not discuss to-night. But I have to ask myself whether the British Commonwealth is going to consider that the retention by Poland of certain territories that are German in every respect, is a question on which British lives are to be sacrificed and British wealth dissipated in. a war against Germany for the protection of Poland's interests. We have to consider also the position of Roumania, another of our projected allies. Roumania is in possession of a considerable area of former Bulgarian territory known as the Dobruja, as well as Bessarabia, an area purely Russian in character, and Transylvania. Whether Roumania is right in trying to hold such territory is beside the point, but it is in possession as the result of the Versailles treaty. Is it proposed that there shall be an alliance between Great Britain and Roumania in order to force certain people to remain under the Roumanian- Government? These are only two examples of the dangers confronting Great Britain. When we see Germany, a large, populous, highly-civilized country, ringed about with what it considers grievances, British diplomacy, and, to the extent to which we participate, Australian diplomacy, must look the facts in the face. We must ask ourselves whether the settlement of these grievances calls for the most skilful diplomacy on the part of Britain, and, to the extent to which we participate in the direction of British foreign policy, to Australian diplomacy as well. Countries like Italy, Germany and Japan are suffering grievances and, if so, what are the best methods which we and our collaborators can employ for the dissolution of such grievances. I am not saying at this stage that these matters should be recognized by us as grievances, but in order to arrive at a proper understanding of foreign policy, this Parliament must look at these things, not only from our own point of view, and the way in which they affect our interests, but also from the viewpoint of other powers. It is only by getting an appreciation of the other man's point of view that we can expect a true understanding of the world situation and determine on the wisest course to ensure peace, which I believeis the sincere desire of the people of all countries. Since the conclusion of the Great Warwe have seen the establishment of new European powers within the altered political boundaries decided upon at the Versailles Conference. The difficulties arising from this re-alignment of the peoples of Europe, has been a bone of contention for a great many years. One of these new powers has been practically dissolved. What the final terms of dissolution are we do not, at this stage, know; but we do know that something new has appeared in world affairs. I refer to the method by which Germany is securing domination over certain other territories in Europe. Two things stand out in bold relief. One is the remarkable success with which the German Fuhrer has selected the time at which to strike, and the second is the bloodlessness of his conquests.","17"
"JTY","The remarkable success achieved by Hitler during the last eighteen months or two years, is the result of his ability to choose the right time and employ to the greatest advantage the element of surprise. The latest change has been in Albania, which is now a part of the Italian Empire. The Balkans have always been regarded as the danger spot of Europe. I understand that Czechoslovakia recognizes no fewer than five official languages in its army and three or four more in the territories incorporated within its boundaries as a result of the Peace Treaty. I do not know how many are recognized in Yugoslavia. It contains a considerable population of Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians, Montenegrins, Serbs and Bulgarians, all of whom are grouped as Yugoslavs, and we are in the unfortunate habit of looking upon them as a - complete homogeneous community, - comparable with our own, whereas they are nothing of the sort. If Great Britain, France or any other country is expected to intervene and' fight for the preservation of those territories every time that war is threatened, I am afraid they will produce material for more wars in five years than their protectors will be able to fight in a hundred years. Certain principles ought to be observed by any government when considering an alliance with another power, especially if the alliance is likely to lead us into hostilities after a short period. I think that the first of them should be, that there is a community of interest between the two powers affected; the second, that there should he identity of objective between those two powers; the third, that there should be geographical or strategical capacity to render mutual aid; and the fourth, that operations of a military character will result in a concentration of forces on the third party rather than in dispersion of the efforts of the allies. I am afraid that certain of the alliances referred to to-day do not measure up to those requirements. I should like to know where, exactly, is the community of interest between Great Britain and Russia? 'Where can be the identity of objective between a country that is anti-Communist and one that is Communist, especially when the matter is viewed in relation to the third parties affected? I also want to know where are those geographical and strategical considerations which would render it possible for us and for Roumania and Poland mutually to aid each other? I look at the long lines of communication from Great Britain, round the Kattegat, up past the German coast to Danzig - the only piece of sea coast Poland has, and one which would be shot to pieces by the first rapid German invasion. It would not need more than an army corps to go through there. We should then have no means of access to Poland. Poland is as effectively cut off from the sea as Switzerland has been throughout its history. How should we send arms into Poland? Of what use would ships be to a country which had no sea coast? Aircraft, he it ever so strong,- would not he permitted to cross Germany to go to the assistance of Poland. So in order to assist Poland we should have to fight a diversion war; in other words, in order to relieve pressure on Poland we should have to attack Germany on the western front. Again, I say that that is a prospect to which no statesman, either of' Great Britain or of this country, could look forward with equanimity. Now take the case of Roumania. If, as is visualized, our opponents were Germany and Italy, we should have to run the gauntlet of any submarine campaign in the Atlantic. We should have to get into the Mediterranean, which would be to a greater degree under the influence - I shall not say the control - of Italy than has ever been the case in past wars. We should have to traverse the whole of the Mediterranean, to pass the Dardanelles - which this time might be held by a hostile Bulgaria - and the Bosphorous - which might again be held by a hostile Bulgaria - and assist Roumania through the Black Sea. These lines of communication are so long and so attenuated that it is almost impossible for any sane man, having any regard whatever for the considerations that arise- military, naval, and in respect of communications - to pay any reasonable attention to the proposal.","17"
"KIX","What aTe we to do - give Germany the lot?","17"
"JTY","I do not know that it is our affair. This is on3 of the things that we have to square up. I have heard honora'ble gentlemen say, ' You canont allow any further German expansion to the east; Germany would possess itself of the wheat and oil of Roumania.' Let me point out to honorable members that during the last war Germany held every inch of what was lately known as Czechoslovakia, every inch of Austria, practically the whole of Poland - at one stage every inch of it - all of Yugoslavia, a considerable portion of Greece, and the whole, of Bulgaria and Roumania. Turkey was on its side - the old Turkey, not the new. Germany had access to all that oil and wheat, and obtained its requirements at very small cost. If any honorable member of this House cares to read the history of - the invasion of Roumania by Von Mackensen, he will realize that the Kingdom of Roumania, which is held up to-day as one of the bulwarks of peace and of democracy in Europe, was con:quered by a handful of a reserve division of the German army in a period of about six weeks. I say that Roumania is a reed on which neither this country nor Great Britain can afford to lean. Considerations of this sort must be weighed when we are choosing our allies. Just as we pick the enemy that we are going to fight, so also let us exercise a little common sense and circumspection in our selection of those who are likely to stand by our side. Therefore we have to consider the question to which I referred in principle number 4, namely, the dispersion of effort. One of the principles to be observed should be the concentration of your greatest possible force at the weakest point in the defences of your enemy. With allies of this description, not strength, but weakness would bo brought to any alliance. They would demand ships, aeroplanes, and above all, munitions and the transport necessary to- take those munitions to them. These would impose upon the resources of Great Britain and its dominions, a strain which it would be very difficult for those resources to meet. Consequently, I say that, in considering he foreign policy of this country, we have to take into account matters of that description. The Minister for External Affairs (Sir Henry Gullett) referred in his speech to the United States of America. I admit that the United States of America is able to exercise great force. But its reluctance to use that force in any venture outside American territories is fairly well known. Once only has it been embroiled in a European war, and if I am any judge of its policy, it is not only the intention but also the determination of the American people that that time shall be the last. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) made some reference to what he termed the common origin of the United States of America. It has a most uncommon origin. Its people have come from- every one of these quibbling, squabbling, central European States. There is no such thing as a common origin, and consequently there is no such thing as a common outlook, in the United States of America. It regards European politics, and world affairs generally, from the viewpoint of every minority within its borders. That was proved during the last war. One of the reasons why Woodrow Wilson could not send troops to Europe at an earlier stage than he did, even if he were willing to do so, was the hostility of the huge German and Austrian minorities within his country. If it were a matter to-day of lining up in European politics, the United States of America would be faced with the same minority problem a3 it faced in 1916 and 1917. The minorities apply the brake.","17"
"JTY","I do not admit that I am, although I may say that I fought alongside a few of them - as did my friend the honorable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Blain) - in the South Australian battalion. If trouble came again I would very much sooner fight side by side with some GermanAustralians in my electorate than with one or two of my friends opposite. I come now to the last consideration, namely, the Australian position in relation to the Pacific. We have to consider this, because we are in a peculiar position. We are about to enter into diplomatic relations with the governments of the United States of America and Japan. The Minister for External Affairs this afternoon laid great stress on the necessity for friendship between Japan and the Commonwealth of Australia. Again I say that the matter resolves itself into one of interest. The criticism levelled at Japan on account of the venture into which it has entered in China has found many repercussions in this country - repercussions which have found expression in this House, on the waterfront, in the street, in the press, over the air, and in other quarters. This brings us up against a great problem. Because we are a small country - small in numbers, though not in area - with great problems of development ahead of us, it is necessary for us to take an ever increasing interest in the relationship which exists between Great Britain and the different countries of Europe; because peace and British security, and the supremacy of British foreign policy in Europe, mean for us that peace and security which out of our own resources of money and man power we could not purchase for ourselves. Therefore, this matter of European peace even overshadows some considerations which under happier circumstances - happier to the extent of the difference in our conditions were our population 20,000,000 instead of 7,000,000 - would not weigh so heavily with us. My only concern is that the Government shall use every endeavour, whenever the opportunity is presented, to ensure that British policy is firm, strong, and united; above all, that it is well directed - that it is directed towards tasks which are capable of accomplishment and, principally, capable of justification.","17"
"JSC","I have heard many addresses from the honorable member who has just concluded his speech, but I had never hoped for such longevity as would enable me to hear from him a speech with which I entirely agreed. Yet the totally unexpected has occurred. If I have served no other useful purpose as -a representative of a section of the democracy in this Parliament, at least I can go down to my grave claiming that I have made one convert at least. I pass from the sublime to the less so, from the speech of the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) to that of the Minister for External Affairs (Sir Henry Gullett). I pass from that to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin), merely for the purpose of saying that I agree, as I usually do, with everything that my leader has said, with a single exception, namely, that part of his speech in which he said that by his speech the Minister for External Affairs had made a valuable contribution to the records of this Parliament. With that sentiment I take leave totally to disagree. Notwithstanding the fact that the latter portion of the speech was in agreement with my views - being totally opposed to the first portion, which was completely opposed to my views - I desire to say that I regard the speech as being prejudiced, contradictory, and in terms calculated to incite friendly peoples against this country, which is so much in need of friendly neighbours. If I had made this speech immediately following that of the Minister for External Affairs, my observations about his speech, even within the limits imposed by the Standing Orders, would have been much more bitter than anything that I have so far said. But after dinner, when one is enjoying a gentlemanly state of repletion, one is able to approach these matters with a more balanced mind than in the latter part of the afternoon when one is somewhat tired and hungry. That is the only reason why I have not been more condemnatory of the speech made by the honorable gentleman. This Government, this little, marooned, helpless minority-Government, invites, or incites - I hardly know which - a discussion on foreign affairs with the appearance of magnanimity and a desire to give to honorable members an opportunity to discuss what they insist is a most important subject. . The truth is that, having taken their places on the Government bench, Ministers did not prepare a programme because they did not expect to be there the next day. Even now, they are living from day to day in expectation of the axe. Having no programme, and very little hope for the future, they say ' Put foreign affairs before members, and then they can go all over the world, from the north pole to the south pole, as on one of Cook's specially conducted tours, and everything that they say will be in order'. And so we are spending the greater part of to-day's sitting on matters which really have very little concern at all with Australia, notwithstanding the fact that there are many pressing and urgent matters awaiting attention that do intimately affect the people of this country. Most of us have had experience of some of these things, for when we go home at week-ends we meet people on our doorsteps, or lined up in processions, asking for letters of introduction to the munition works, or for something in the nature of employment somewhere. Most of us have experience similar to that indicated to us by the honorable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr), who cited a responsible educational authority as having asked whether' this Parliament could not do something to solve the grave social problem of the increasing numbers of unemployed youths in this country. These are some of the problems that we might have been facing, and upon which a little money might have been spent. But they are not to be considered as urgent or as important as happenings in the Balkan States, Czechoslovakia, Bohemia, Poland, and other places in Europe. The cry is ' Let us get to Europe out of Australia; let us be anything on God's earth but Australians in an Australian parliament, doing the work that we were sent here to do '. I am, nevertheless, interested in foreign affairs as a study in my leisure time, of which I have very little, because I am interested in the human family, regarded as a band of brothers and sisters. In a secondary sense, I am interested in it because I realize the danger of this meddling and muddling Government lasting long enough to embroil the people of this country in one of those petty' wars in Central Europe to which the honorable member for Barker made such eloquent and well-informed reference. I should like occasionally to remind honorable members of this House that Australia is an autonomous nation which has no responsibility, either in law or in fact, to any other country, and, notwithstanding opinions held to the contrary by other persons for whose scholarship I ' have great respect, I maintain that only the Australian Government, that is to say, the representative of the Sovereign on the advice of the Australian Government, can involve Australia in war or proclaim peace for Australia should it be at war. If it be a fact, as has been publicly declared and preached the world over, originating in Great Britain itself, that Australia is a nation and is not in any particular whatsoever subordinate to any other dominion or to Great Britain itself, how can it be suggested, or argued, that we can be at war by the will of some other nation to which, as a matter of law and practice, it is publicly declared that we are not in any way whatever subject or responsible, the more so as this position is ratified by the statute law of Great Britain? It has been said that the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations have a common Sovereign That is perfectly true; but they have a Sovereign who, in each case, according to equally well-established constitutional theory, acts upon the advice of the executive government of the particular dominion or country whose interests are affected. That fact is accepted. as law by each of the dominions, and by Great Britain, and therefore it should be beyond the need for demonstration that nothing but the will of the Australian people, acting through an Australian government, can possibly, either in law or in fact, involve this country in war.","17"
"JSC","The honorable gentleman has certainly misrepresented me. If I have misrepresented him, I shall be prepared to be more generous to him than he has been to me. I have put upon his words the only reasonable construction. The honorable gentleman also said that the democracies desired peace because of their fear of war under modern conditions. He went on to say that the people of the dictatorship countries wanted peace for the same reason, but that there was a. difference between them, because the people of the democracies want peace because they are free men whereas the people of Germany and other dictatorship countries are slaves. I sometimes wonder how much a single individual can do to preserve world peace. One would suppose very little, and, yet, I think that a single individual can do a good deal to bring about world war. I know nothing more 'that an individual can do in that way than to select some great power stronger than ourselves with which we are at peace and publicly use his own parliament for the purpose of insulting both the masses and the government of that friendly power. I know nothing more in that way that an honorable member can do than that, and I think it may be potent. It is quite possible that the honorable gentleman's words may be read in a foreign country; it may be represented to the government of that country that he is a responsible Minister of the Crown, and with the aid of a provocative press it may be properly inferred by that government that he is speaking for his own country as a whole when he denounces, for example, the great German race with its history of art, culture and music, and even religious zeal extending back into the mists of antiquity, and refers to these hundred-odd millions of people as slaves of the tyrant Hitler. Such a gratuitous insult serves no useful purpose except to illustrate the ignorance of the people who utter it. It serves no other purpose whatever. Such utterances are a contribution to world war. What else can an honorable gentleman do to incitethan to insult friendly nations who are supposed to be opposed to us in their theory of government? Who are we that we should dictate to the German people what their form' of government should be? Have we made such a wonderful success of democracy in this country that we should wish to peddle our wares in Europe? We are urged to establish a union of democracies against the dictatorship states. We are to have a union of the great American democracy with the European democracies, including Great Britain; we are to have a union between Wall-street, on the one hand, and the London Daily Mail, on the other, as samples of democracy in our time; we are to have a union between Stalin and the Pilgrim Fathers in order to show that we are a number of hearts beating as one. All this we are to do in the interests of democracy. Let us put our own house in order. Let us go into the big cities of these great democracies and relieve the shameful want and suffering of the millions there. Let us attend to problems in our own country where half our people are seeking employment, where the substance of our industries is wasted in policies of fear and terror abroad, and where a few million pounds cannot be found to employ those born in this country, great, free, as we claim, and rich as it is. Therefore, I say, we should abstain from troubling - our heads to insult dictators who are not offending us. We should abstain from threatening the working-class people in Germany, or Italy, with whom we have no quarrel. The honorable gentleman said that I would give three cheers for Germany. May I ask, why should I not give three cheers for Germany? I should sooner give three cheers for Germany as a friendly nation which at any rate is not offending against me or mine, than for this remnant United Australia party Government which is doing much harm and little good. I know that there is a theory that when you are at war with a country you must not, on any account, be just to that nation; because that dees not accord with the rules of military necessity. When you are at war you must play the part which you do not ordinarily play in private life of being a humbug, a liar and a cad. You must do that because of military necessity; that is the rule, and if you do not obey it you will be haled before the appropriate tribunal and dealt with under the War Precautions Act. ' But surely the rule does not apply as between us and nations with which we are not at war. Surely we are not so dead sure of putting on a war that we need start in advance to apply the order of being a humbug, a liar and a cad before the war breaks out, even though we grant it that we must do all those things after the war starts. With my next point the honorable member for Barker has dealt so effectively that I need hardly do more than associate myself with hi3 arguments. That point is that the real danger which confronts the world arises from one* of the embarrassments which are our common heritage, namely, that the small nations are a menace to peace. The small nations of Europe create great difficulties among themselves. I may say that they have my sympathy, but the matter is not one which concerns us at all, and in that regard we can congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune. I quite recognize that the existence of small. nations crowded together, of mixed races, religions and histories, are a menace to world peace. It is because of this fact that we are informed in this country through the press that we have had a succession of at least four acute crises, and a continuing crisis which is going on at the present time. A crisis must always be on the pot ready for use by propagandists. We are told that we have had four separate and distinct crises of a serious character. In that regard, although there has been no war, there has been absolutely successful scaremongering and absolutely successful efforts to depress, intimidate and terrorize the Australian people. There has been no war, but it has to be remembered that a scare is as profitable as a war. In fact, a war scare is better than a war because it keeps the war factories going double time every day, and makes multimillionaires out of a few select thousands of people all over the world. It is better than a war, also, because you can keep it going longer. Furthermore, a war scare will sell more newspapers' than a war, because a war scare supplies so many interesting and dramatic changes and lends itself to such variety and originality in newspaper headings that actually it sells far more newspapers than a war itself as a lot of people go away and get killed and cannot buy newspapers and cannot be fooled by what appears in newspapers under editorial efforts. Do not let it be thought when. I speak of this editorial war-mongering, when I say, as I do, that our daily press in that regard is one of the grave social evils affecting this country, and, as such, is a more immediate and deadly threat to world peace than anything which the German Fuhrer, or Mussolini, or anybody else that I know of, is doing, and when I speak of the policies of newspapers, that I am speaking of those great organizations of technicians, workers and working class journalists and others whose business it is to carry out the policy of their masters, and who for the most part are quite well aware - in fact better' aware than I am - of the truth of what I am saying. Far be it from me to say anything derogatory of the bright minds who do this work. Everybody knows that for many years I have been associated with the uplift and betterment of the conditions' of men whose lives are devoted to the selling of newspapers and the supply of news, arid of that splendid band of technicians who are engaged in the production of morning and evening newspapers. But none of this prevents me from saying in this House what I have just said, because I am satisfied that if we lack the courage to deal with this menace, this public evil, this scourge of mendacity, incitement, misrepresentation .and deliberate creation of hate and fear which goes on in the local press whose editors and proprietors are themselves the instruments of a higher monied power than they, then we are encouraging the greatest evil threatening the safety of this, and every other democracy in the world. The first of these crises was when Germany moved into Austria, and that was the first outrage to which the honorable gentleman has referred. What of it if a people vote by a 99 per cent, majority, as the honorable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Green) pointed out, to unite with Germany, their close neighbours and ally in the Great Wai', and with whom they are of one race, and speak the same language?","17"
"JSC","When I hear it said that a nation like Austria was .assimilated simply because it was not capable of any resistance I think of some cases of attempted assimilation in British history, such, for example, as Palestine, where an attempt is being made, with very little success and much resistance, to assimilate Jews and Arabs. I think also of the historic case, running back into the centuries, of the attempt to assimilate Ireland with England without any success. There was no assimilation there. But when, as in the case of the final assimilation of Czechoslovakia with Germany, I hear the Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia say that the people of Czechoslovakia handed their interests over to the German Chancellor 'with every confidence in the Reich ', I feel myself compelled to believe' that it was done primarily, because of mutual interest, history and traditions. We should not expect a great nation like Austria to be readily gobbled up at a moment's notice unless there was some internal willingness; nor should we expect small nations which were thrown together as the result of the greed and dishonesty of those who manipulated the Treaty of Versailles to live in peace and harmony. Chickens come home to roost! It was hardly to be anticipated, I suppose, that the great principle of self-determination, which was mouthed so freely by the so-called democracies at the end of the war, would be applied in such an unexpected way and under such unexpected conditions twenty years later. The absorption of Sudetenland was the first move that affected Czechoslovakia, and 90 per cent, of the people concerned were Germans. What was wrong, about that? According to Lord Runciman, who made a report on the subject to Great Britain, and also according to Mr. Chamberlain, and the French Premier. M. Daladier, what was done at that time was right, proper and reasonable. In fact everything up to the last action of Germany was all right. . Memel, of course, which is 90 per cent. German, was part of the Reich. All these assimilations were made without bloodshed. I ask when, in any historic time, such advances and such alterations of boundaries have been made so bloodlessly, and with so little imperial ferocity, as in the recent settlement in Central Europe? Possibly the peace of Europe is better guaranteed by the combination of these peoples under a central government than by smaller competing nationalities. Possibly, also, the peace of the world is being better assured by these new arrangements than by the old ones. [Leave to continue given. ] The last stage of this movement on the part of the Reich was made when the final section of Czechoslovakia was assimilated. It was in that connexion that the Premier of the area concerned allowed it to be' declared that his government. had every confidence in the Reich. These were people of mixed nationalities, mixed races, mixed relationships, and mixed religions. They 'were held together by no logical system of brotherhood at all. I think that even in relation to these people the best interests of Europe were probably served by their assimilation. The pledge to Britain was that nothing would be done further affecting Britain's interests without notice to the latter. This did not affect Britain's interests. Of course, no attempt to examine these questions is ever made without the person making it having to face the charge that he is more interested in some foreign country than in his own. The people who make such charges cannot possibly believe them. They must make them for purely political purposes and with a jaundiced mind. They bring upon themselves the retort that they are bitterly prejudiced in the interests, not so much of their own country, as of the Commonwealth of Nations of which, as I said earlier in my speech, we are, in some way or other, a part. I find myself in this Parliament to-day as I found myself in the Parliament when it was sitting in Melbourne, during the war, constantly in the position of trying to apply those principles of conduct to nations which ordinary individuals, such as members of this Parliament, try to apply to one another. If a man has a quarrel with his neighbour he regrets it, and would rather smooth over than exacerbate his neighbour. Persons with even the elements of decency do not go about constantly defaming and belittling their neighbours and alleging against them charges in which there is no truth; nor do they aggrandize themselves and boast that they possess all the virtues without exception, whereas their neighbours have none. Yet that is exactly what takes place in connexion with international affairs. It is against that perverted standard of decency that I make my protest. I think I should say in the presence of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) that at least I acquit him of being by any means the worst offender. I go further and say that after his return from Europe his reported speeches evidenced a considerable amount of balance and common sense. If he oan only cultivate the strength of purpose and courage to openly condemn such outrageous perversions of fair standards of conduct as those to which I have referred, he will make a real contribution to world peace. Our neighbour, Japan, and Germany' and Italy, are known as the totalitarian states. They have their systems of government, which are different from ours. I need hardly say that I am totally opposed to the totalitarian system of government and to any idea of a dictatorship. No person in any other country, particularly in any of the totalitarian states, can possibly entertain any resentment because I declare my wholehearted detestation of the system of dictatorships. 1 am also opposed to the materialistic doctrines of the Reich, as I understand them. But I must add that I really have very little opportunity to understand what is proceeding in those countries, or what is moving in the minds of the peoples of those countries. As to the facts to which reference has been made, our sources of information are, in the first place, either tainted or absolutely foul, or, in the second place, when they become available to us on better authority are open to the criticism that we cannot be sure how far authorities are right, since they do not always agree. Usually several months elapse between the events which these observers describe and the time when the journals actually come into our hands. History moves quickly. The falsehoods of last week are forgotten this week, and so the exposure is not news. The falsehood is news, but the exposure is not news, and therefore is of no interest. And so it goes on! My final words on the subject I put in the form of 'a series of questions. 'What have these disputes really to do with us? Why should we interrupt our natural progress because of them? Why should we neglect the interests of suffering people on their account? Why should we create an atmosphere of terror and depression in a country where every one should be going about expressing the joy of life in glad eyes and faces? I do not know. I protest against it. If this Government would spend on the cultivating of the sentiment of world peace, a quarter of the amount of money which it is proposing to spend on equipment to meet an imaginary enemy, or to combat people whom we may exacerbate into enemies, it would do well. We do not know what the Prime Minister proposes to do. I ask him whether he intends to do anything in a positive way to create a better feeling among the nations of the world? Will he also do something to counteract the effect of the inflammable rubbish that is constantly published in the press? Will he deal with this situation? If he cannot suppress the press - and I do not believe in suppressing the press - will he see whether something cannot he done to control it and to put an end to the wild licence and irresponsible conduct of those who control it? I. do not ask for suppression.","17"
"N76","I omitted the other adjectives which had better remain unspoken. Having adopted that description of the Government so picturesquely put forward by the honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan), may I say that the invitation is always open to him, and to those who think like him, to take such action as will prevent us from usurping authority. Unless he does so, we can only conclude that we are exercising such authority as we do by the will of this Parliament, and, therefore, by the will of the Australian people. The honorable member for Batman also said that the subject that we have been discussing to-day was one that did not concern Australia at all. Iwrote down hiswords, and I find his statement a very curious one. If my memory does not play tricks on me, I can recall the Leader of the honorable member's party demanding through the columns; of that press to which the honorable gentleman has just alluded, that Parliament should be called together on an earlier date than was anticipated in order that it might discuss these very matters. It seems curious, indeed, that this Government, having set aside a day for the discussion of these matters within a week of its coming into office, should nowbe told by a responsible and experienced and respected member, of the Opposition that this is a subject of no importance at ail - so unimportant, in fact, that he spoke on it himself, and obtained an extension of time. I desire in the first instance to make a comment on some of the points raised in the course of the debate. The honorable member for Bourke' (Mr. Blackburn) made, as he always does, a thoughtful contribution to the discussion. Indeed, I take this opportunity to say that I always listen to the honorable member for Bourke with respect, and usually with disagreement. He made one point in particular that 1 should, like to take the liberty to underline. It is a point well worth considering, although I should not have applied it myself quite in the way that he did. He said something like this - I do not profess to give his exact words. He said that a state of stifled war is dangerous to our representative institutions. I believe that to be .profoundly true. I believe that, just so long as the world has to remain under arms, wondering when a war is going to be forced upon it, just so long will representative institutions in democratic countries be in a state of real danger, because inevitably, in those circumstances, we must intensify authority and tend to restrict liberty.","17"
"N76","No, it is an adoption of what I believe to be a thoughtful analysis of the situation by the honorable member for Bourke. But what is the cure for it? The cure is to get as quickly as we can out of a state of affairs in which the world has to stand to arms. How do we get out of that state of affairs? Not by going on indefinitely in the state of mind of the last three years, but by doing exactly what the Government of Great Britain has been doing during the last few months - by saying in perfectly clear terms, ' This sort of thing cannot go on for ever ', and saying it, may I add, to people who think it no laughing matter. Great Britain has, I believe, whatever errors may have been nia.de in foreign policy during the last twenty years - and I am prepared to admit .that there have been errors - set u magnificent example during the last two years of forbearance in dealing with the affairs of Europe. She has been patient; she has endeavoured to the best of her ability to understand, but her patience and understanding have not, as we now know, achieved the result that we hoped they would achieve. My colleague, the Minister for External Affairs (Sir Henry Gullett) has been accused of making provocative utterances in this regard. Is it not a simple fact that, to the extent to which there is crisis in Europe to-day, it has been produced by circumstances outside the control of the British Government - by circumstances which came into existence in spite of an honorable arrangement made by the Government of the United Kingdom? We remember all too vividly what occurred in relation to the Sudeten dispute. We remember the dramatic pause that occurred in our lives when Mr. Chamberlain went to Munich, and when he came back with the Agreement of Munich. We all remember that on that occasion not only was a general pact and peaceful settlement entered into, but the leader of the German people also calmly and reasonably said, ' This is the end of our territorial ambitions in Europe'. Was that the end? If, in fact, the absorption of the Sudeten territory was followed by the total absorption of Bohemia and Moravia; if in fact, that was followed by demands on Poland and possibly on Roumania, is that a matter for which British statesmanship can accept responsibility? Certainly not, but it is a matter which affects the peace of Europe. It is a matter which affects the peace of the world, and it is a contributing factor towards the grim standing to arms among the nations of the world, which is producing that very state of affairs referred to by the honorable member for Bourke. I wish to refer to the speech of the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), though I do not propose to traverse the whole of his speech, because time would not permit me. He emphasized something that I believe to have a germ of truth in it. He emphasized the view that there are real grievances to bp found in Europe. To Poland, for example, Germany may well say, ' We have real grievances against you in relation to Danzig, in relation to the Corridor, and in relation to Upper Silesia '. I agree that there is a real case in regard to those matters. I agree that there would be no more admirable thing than that all the nations concerned should come around the conference table and say, ' We will state our grievances. We will be particular about them. We will say exactly what we think we should have.' It would be an admirable thing if the other nations should come to the conference table and say, ' We will forget old grievances; we will forget old prejudices and old hatreds '. That would be an idyllic state of affairs; but if grievances are to be examined, I suggest to the honorable member for Barker they should be examined, not at the point of the sword, but at the conference table. How are. they being examined in Europe to-day? What technique has been developed, particularly during the last twelve months, . for dealing with these matters? The fact is that the demand for the redress of a grievance has almost invariably been followed by a threat of military action. Is that the right way to settle disputes? Is that the way to bring about the state of idealism suggested by the honorable member for Batman when he said that conduct among nations should be patterned upon conduct among individuals?","17"
"N76","Whatever may be the internal problems of the United States of America, whatever controversy may have arisen regarding the internal economic policy of President Roosevelt, no one will deny that he has made contributions to the peace of the world by the statements he has made and by the message he has addressed to ,the European, countries mentioned. I venture to say that one of 'his greatest claims to reputation in the history of his country will be that, in spite of the known feeling, the intelligible feeling of the American people, that they should keep out of the world's troubles, he has addressed observations to the world at crucial moments,, which I believe have breathed a lofty spirit of idealism at the right time. In his last message he put a question with great simplicity and great force to the dictators. I shall give merely the substance of it. He said : ' After all, there can be no war without aggression. Do you really believe that your neighbours are going to commit an aggression against you? If you do not, then you may produce peace by simply saying in a binding fashion that you will not commit an aggression against them '. Like all the great questions in the world's history, that question, in the statement of it, is a simple one. It is a question that we may all put to those great powers^ 'We may all say to them, as I hope we shall - ' You have no grievance that we are not prepared to discuss with you. You have no case to put before the world's forum that we are not prepared to examine without prejudice; in the good old words of the courts 'Without fear, favour, or affection'; but if you are going to keep the world on tenterhooks, if you are going to keep the world in arms by refusing to confer, by refusing to have your grievances examined, then we shall have to say that there can be no war except by aggression, and tha't if war comes we shall know, and the whole world shall know by whose aggression it came '. My last observation is provoked by what I have just said concerning the messages sent by the President of the United States of America. Something has been said - and I desire to make a few more observations concerning it - in regard to our relations with the United States of America, or, if I may broaden the subject a little, in regard to the particular problem that we have* in the Pacific. Now, sir, a cynical onlooker might be disposed to say that when a small country of 7,000,000 people starts to talk about friendship with a country of 130,000,000 people just across the Pacific, it is merely,- so to speak, ' getting in out of the wet '; that it is doing something which, as a matter of cold policy, is or may be essential to its security, and that therefore you may dismiss what it is doing as something that is quite unreal. I am happy to think that that cynical view is not entertained by the American people. The fact is that we are a community of 7,000,000 people living on this continent of ours; but the fact also is that we are, in a sense, the representatives in this country of a very great race 'of people, and that that great race of people is as vital to the essential interests - in the best sense of that word - of America as America is vital to ours. Were I charged with the responsibility of government in the United States of Am erica, I should not care to contemplate a world in which the strength, the liberal thought,- and the genius for self-government, of the British people had been, extinguished. I should regard myself as having been left quite lonely in a strange world. That is the interest which America has in the British world; and the British world, in its turn, has in America the interest which it must have in a great community of people, also of liberal thoughts, nurtured in similar traditions, speaking the same language, and practising the same political ideals. You can, if you like, wave aside with a cynical hand the relations that exist between America and Australia, but the fact will remain that we have a great interest in each other, and that we shall have a growing interest in each other. I appeal to honorable members and to the whole of the Australian people to do everything in their power to improve their understanding with the American people, because I believe that on an association with them, on an understanding with them, a great deal of future happiness for this country oan be built.'","17"
"N76","I am obliged to the honorable member for that remark, because he has recalled to me something which. I might not otherwise have mentioned before I sat down. I have recently, on more than one occasion, spoken of our special and peculiar foreign problem as the Pacific problem; because I believe that the Pacific is of all zones in the world the zone in which our risks are primary risks and our responsibilities are primary responsibilities. Consequently, as I have already indicated, this Government proposes to take the necessary steps as soon as may be, not only to establish a closer diplomatic contact with the United States of America and with Japan - those two great and friendly powers in the Pacific - but also to do everything that it can to increase our cultural relationship, our personal contact with them, to improve all of those things which go to make up a real and permanent understanding. What the world wants, I agree, is peace; but what the world also wants, if I may suggest it, is less talk of an axis which may carry the engines of war and destruction, and more talk of a peace axis. If I may allow my fancy to wander a little, I like to think of that peace axis as having studded on to it, if you like, London, Washington, and Canberra.","17"
"KX7","I do not agree with some honorable members who have made contributions to this debate, that we can be entirely unmindful of major happenings on the other side of the world. Nor do I agree with the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) that he has respect for the forms of government which operate in certain countries of Europe to-day, and against which the Labour party has levelled a great deal of criticism; because I think that no member of the Labour party at least should say that he can view with respect a government which had been responsible for the suppression of trade union organizations and the imprisonment and internment of, many fighters on the side of the workers of those countries. My suspicions are aroused when I see so many persons connected with the antiLabour forces in this country suddenly become champions of democracy. I agree with the Prime Minister that whenever nations take part in an intense armaments race there is danger to established democratic institutions. But since when has the Commonwealth Government been the champion of democracy? On many occasions, not only in this Parliament, but also in the Parliament of Victoria, the Prime Minister himself has shown clearly that he is not a believer in democratic forms of government, for he has supported legislation aimed at destroying the effective organization of workers on the waterfront, and suppressing meetings of workers to discuss their problems. Probably the Prime Minister spoke a little more plainly to-night than he intended. Unless the Labour party be fully alive to the situation, the democratic institutions of this country will be in danger, for I have no doubt that should the Government consider it necessary to assist Great Britain in the event of that country becoming involved in war, many of our alleged liberties would be lightly set aside, because the Government would hold the - opinion that the existence of democratic institutions might retard the Government's programme and prevent it from giving Unlimited assistance to Great Britain. When I was informed that a discussion on foreign affairs would take place to-day, I thought not only that the Prime Minister would indicate to the Parliament that Australia would declare itself free to determine its own course in international affairs, but also that the Government would announce its own foreign policy. The statements that have come from the Government bench, however, indicate that there is to be no radical change in the existing practice. In matters affecting foreign policy, it appears that the Government of Great Britain is still to speak for the whole Empire. Because of that, we must review the situation, and ask ourselves whether it is wise that 'Australia should continue to follow Great Britain on every occasion. I am not prepared to agree that the British Government has been generous in its attitude to the solution of European problems of recent times. Much has been said of the fact that Mr. Chamberlain flew to Germany in September last in order to interview Herr Hitler. As the result of that interview, the Munich Agreement was signed; but what sacrifice did it entail on the part of the British Government or the British nation? At Munich the dismemberment of another nation was agreed to. If Great Britain was not prepared to take a more definite stand in the interests of Czechoslovakia, its representatives should have kept out of the negotiations entirely. What happened was that the representatives of Czechoslovakia were closed out of the conference at which the dismemberment of their country was agreed to by the representatives of four great powers, after they had discussed their own material interests. Yet we are told that Great Britain made a generous sacrifice on that occasion. It is true that that country is now taking a more definite stand against the totalitarian states, but the reason is that those states, not satisfied with their conquests to date, are making demands in other quarters in which British imperialists have interests. Only when their interests arc endangered will the imperialists of the nation resort to war. They are not actuated by any desire to preserve existing democratic institutions; if they were, they would find ample scope for their activities inside their own country. The La'bour party 'believes in a policy of co-operation with all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations; it does not believe in the domination of the- other members by the Mother Country, as does the Government. The Labour party believes in the holding of conferences to discuss various problems which are common to all parts of the Empire; it is not prepared to be told by British imperial interests that. irrespective of the interests of Australia, this country is to he dragged at the heels of Great Britain into any war in which that country cares to engage. Many members of this Parliament say that we in Australia cannot do anything to prevent wars, but I do not accept that view. Honorable members may recollect that in 1922, only four years after the termination of the Great War, Great Britain was considering the possibility of another conflict with Turkey. Mr. Lloyd George, who was Prime Minister of Great Britain at the time, communicated with the Prime Minister of each of the dominions, asking what measure of assistance the dominions would render to Great Britain in the event of war with Turkey. Mr. Hughes was Prime Minister of Australia at the time, and he informed Mr. Lloyd George that the Australian Government was prepared to send forces abroad only if it were absolutely necessary. The then Prime Minister of Canada was even more definite in his utterance, for he said that in no circumstances would Canada engage in another conflict. Those replies caused the British Government to change its policy and eventually a compromise was effected with Turkey. Further conferences with the Turkish representatives were held, with the result that a peaceful settlement was arrived at without resort to arms. On that occasion the governments of the dominions made a definite contribution to the preservation of world peace. I am confident that if Australia indicated to Great Britain that it would make its own decision in respect of any conflict with other nations, the other dominions would follow Australia's lead, and a different attitude would be adopted by the British imperialist authorities. Some years ago this Parliament was asked to support a policy of applying economic sanctions to Italy because of that country's treatment of Abyssinia. On that occasion, members of the Labour party opposed the application of economic sanctions against Italy because we were satisfied that Australia could do nothing that would be likely to save the Abyssinians from domination by one form of imperialism or another. We recognized that it was only a war between conflicting classes of imperialisms for the control of that country. The only time when imperialistic nations evince interest in any country is not when, as the honorable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) indicated this evening, they want to educate, or give the alleged benefits of civilization to its people, but when they find that a particular territory possesses valuable raw materials which they require. Consequently, Britain's interest in Abyssinia was not so much that it wanted to save poor Abyssinia from Italian domination, but simply because it knew that the nation which controlled Abyssinia controlled Lake Tsana, the source of the River Nile, which was of vital importance to Egypt. . For these reasons we found that Britain was prepared to do everything possible to prevent Italy from subjugating Abyssinia.","17"
"KX7","Evidently both the British and Italian authorities hold a different view, because Ave find that Italy gave the United Kingdom certain specific undertakings regarding Lake Tsana. If there Was no way in which Italian control of Abyssinia could have affected the water supply from Lake Tsana. I ask the honorable gentleman to indicate the necessity for such a guarantee on the part of Italy. The facts are that the League of Nations declared Italy to be the aggressor in that dispute; both Great Britain and Australia were parties to that declaration, and, under article 16 of the covenant, decided to apply economic sanctions against Italy. Later, however, Great Britain changed its attitude entirely and urged the League to pass a resolution recognizing the King of Italy as Emperor of Ethiopia. That resolution was proposed by Lord Halifax, who told the League Council that he did not want it to retract one word it had said previously against Italy, but argued that it must recognize the fact that Italy had control of almost the whole of Abyssinia and it would be foolish to go on living in an unreal world unless the members of the League were prepared to resort to arms to remedy the position. Thus, within a few months. Great Britain took steps to reverse its entire policy in connexion with the Italo-Abyssinia dispute after steps had been taken to preserve the interests of the British capitalists. It Was only with these interests- that the Imperial Government was at any time concerned, and they are the only interests Avith which any form of imperialism is concerned in the various storm centres of the world to-day. Australia has every reason to remain on pacific terms with Japan and the other nations in the Far East. Some years ago we sent a goodwill mission to Japan, headed by the then Attorney-General, Sir John Latham, now Chief Justice of the High Court; but, following the return of that mission, our attitude towards Japan changed. It is rather remarkable that in opening this debate the Minister for External Affairs (Sir Henry Gullett) said that he could not imagine why Japan was deserting its old friends and turning towards the totalitarian states. The obvious reason is that Japan's old friends have turned on it. This country, for instance, had no need to do so, and probably would not have done so, but for the fact that the Commonwealth Government during recent years has been dominated by Imperial interests. I recall that our trade diversion policy, which severely hit Japan, was only devised after we had had a visit from a very influential deputation representing British manufacturing interests who were being challenged in the markets of the world, including Australia, by the improved technique of the Japanese manufacturers. It never promised to confer any material benefit upon this country. Its adoption, however, waa provocative to Japan, and, naturally, the Japanese were forced to retaliate. Every one must regret and view Avith abhorrence the present SinoJapanese* conflict. Japan has resorted to bombing out of existence towns peopled largely by defenceless women and children. The British authorities have protested on many occasions against such action, evidently because they think that it is a good thing to try to delude the people of British countries into believing that all the 'Government is concerned about is the protection of human life and the maintenance of the liberties of the people. What are the facts? Let us examine the attitude of this Government, and of the Imperial Government, towards this conflict. As far back as 1937 the League of Nations, of which Australia is still a member, decided that Japan had broken the Nine-Power Agreement and the Pact of Paris by violating Chinese territory, and by that decision virtually declared Japan to be the aggressor in the conflict. In such circumstances one would haw expected the members of the league immediately to apply economic sanctions against Japan, because this was the logical step to take in view of the league's policy of collective security. . I do not believe that association with the League of Nations has ever given security to small nations; in the light of recent events it can be better described as collective insecurity. But if the League of Nations were worth anything at all one would have expected the members of the league, if they failed to apply sanctions, at least to refrain from doing anything which would help Japan as the aggressor. Under article 17 of the covenant, China appealed to the league to call a conference to consider its position. As it had already withdrawn from the league, Japan refused to recognize the league's authority and declined to attend the conference. The league then decided to apply article 16 of the covenant which, in effect, meant the application of economic sanctions against Japan. It was not prepared to make that decision binding upon members, but left individual nations to decide in their discretion, what action they might take to aid China in this way. Australia was a party to that agreement, but has this Government done anything to honour it? Instead of honouring that undertaking by doing something which might have helped to weaken Japan's attack on defenceless China, it actually took steps against workers in this country when they attempted to apply sanctions against Japan. That is an indication of the interests which supporters of this Government, and also of the Imperial Government, believe should be defended. They are prepared to go so far as to make verbal protests against, and to express horror at, the bombing of defenceless Chinese cities, but they are not prepared to endanger the profits of their supporters. The waterside workers at Port Kembla objected to loading war equipment and material for Japan in contravention of decisions of the League of Nations which were supported by a representative of this Government; but the Government was not prepared to support the workers. 'We hear a great deal from time to time about the danger of engaging in an armaments race, but not one honorable member on the Government side of the House has made any protest in the course of this discussion against the exorbitant profits which certain wealthy financial interests in this country are making, , and will make, through the manufacture of munitions. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which is really one of the masters of this Government, dictated the policy that the Government should adopt in respect of the waterside workers at Port Kembla. Let us try to ascertain how sincere Imperialists are in their, expressed desire that the democracies should defend their liberties. It is true that much has been said on this subject, but I remind the British Imperialists, and particularly the Imperialists in this country, and also its workers, that although a great deal is said about defending democratic institutions against the encroachment of fascism in Europe, these same institutions are in grave danger from the operations of Fascists in this country. I view with abhorrence the activities of Fascists against working-class organizations in other parts of the world, and I am not blind to the fact that the Fascists are marching forward in Australia. We should be careful to ensure that their activities do not become more dangerous than they now are to our institutions. We have sufficient repressive legislation upon our statute-book to enable the Government to suppress every form of working-class Activity in this country if it cared to do so; but the Government allows these statutes to remain inoperative until some occasion arises to apply them against the workers in circumstances which in its opinion require action. If the Government were true to the democratic principles which certain of its members and supporters enunciate, it would take immediate steps to repeal those sections of the Crimes Act which deal with political offences. It would also repeal the Transport Workers Act, which, in its present form, applies to the workers of Australia the objectionable licensing system which is to-day in common use in Fascist countries. So while we talk about the need to combat fascism abroad we should keep in mind the need to combat it in this country. Reverting for a moment to the Chinese situation, I remind honorable members that although Dr. Wellington Koo, the Chinese representative at the League of Nations, pleaded with member nations of the League to place an embargo on the supply of arms, oil and finance to Japan, the League, although it had already de.clared Japan to be an aggressor nation, declined to take any definite action. This was after it had been decided that economic sanctions should be enforced against Japan. China has not had a fair deal from the member nations of the League of Nations which, apparently, are prepared to act only in such a way as will preserve their own interests. I do not say that this attitude is restricted to Great Britain. It is common of all imperialistic nations. On this subject I direct attention to the following official statement of the case which sets out the matters in respect of which Great Britain was concerned: -","17"
"KX7","It was arranged that a frank discussion should take place between the Foreign Minister and the Ambassador on the causes of friction between the two countries. The chief of these were the following: - The ban on navigation up the River Yangtse; interference with the Whangpoo Conservancy Boaro an organization vital to the port of Shanghai; interference with the British shipping at Tsingtao; restriction of access to portions of the International Settlement in Shanghai; restriction on the return of British residents to Nanking; -restrictions on the re-opening of foreign-owned factories in occupied areas; and the seizure by the Japanese army of certain British-financed railways.","17"
"KX7","It appears, therefore, that so long as the Japanese Government was prepared to respect British interests in relation to the matters mentioned, the friction between Great Britain and Japan would not be serious. Britain, apparently, was quite prepared to overlook the serious plight of the unfortunate Chinese people. The agreement finally reached on the subjects to which I have referred is set out in the same official publication in the following words : -","17"

I am now in a position to inform the honorable member that this company, Phoenix Oil Extractors (Proprietary) Limited, of 117 Pittstreet, Sydney, asked for a free grant of up to Â£15,000 for the purpose of erecting a standard commercial unit of medium capacity. The company was informed that the whole question of the extent to which the Government should assist private enterprise in matters of this kind was recently reported upon by the Commonwealth Standing Committee on Liquid Fuels. The committee expressed the view that the Government should not advance money for the proving of any particular type of retort or process. This was regarded essentially as the responsibility of the designers or patentees, who would normally be rewarded according to the merits of their propositions through the usual commercial channels. In view of these circumstances the application was refused.","17"
