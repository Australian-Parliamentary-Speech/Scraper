"ZD4","The speech made last week by the Prime Minister covered the whole range of the Government's economic policies in regard to the money supply. I cannot recall the precise words but they are similar to a number of speeches made on the subject recently which draw attention to the fact that one of the very successful areas of the economic policy of the present Government since it came to power three years ago has been that it has been able to get the rate of growth in the money supply in Australia under control. The honourable member's question gives me the opportunity to put into perspective statements and predictions about the rate of growth of the money supply which have been made by the Government. As the honourable member knows it has been the practice of this Government at the time of the last two or three Budgets to give an indication of the growth in the money supply which it thinks might be appropriate to activity in the economy over the period covered by the Budget. It is true, according to figures on the money supply which have been released by the Reserve Bank, that to the end of January the increase is running at an annual rate of 11 per cent. There is no argument about that. That is a simple statistical fact. The honourable member also knows that there are seasonal fluctuations in the rate of growth of the money supply. Last year people were saying that it would go well under the projection. This year people are saying that it will go well over the projection. The point that has to Be made is that the figure given at Budget time is not a firm, absolute commitment. It is likely that the money supply outcome for the current financial year will be above the upper end of the range in the Budget. But the important aspect is whether that of itself is an unfortunate occurrence and whether that of itself is inappropriate to economic conditions as they exist now. The projection is made on the basis of perceptions at Budget time. The important point is what the thrust of money supply policy is. The Government has consistently followed a money supply policy since coming to government to keep it at such a level that helps to bring down inflation whilst at the same time underwriting economic recovery. Given the developments in the economy since the time of the Budget, I would regard a money supply outcome which might happen to be above the upper end of the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range as entirely appropriate in achieving those two objectives. It is, of course, a question of magnitude. I think that it is understood that one makes a prediction at Budget time and, given developments since, that prediction ought not be seen as an absolute commitment."
"KDV","Mr Fraser replied that it was insulting to other countries' OECD representatives to suggest that they could be influenced in that way. And a senior Treasury official added that 'certain people ought to grow up'. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, was asked last night to comment on the differences in the OECD draft and final reports. He said he did not accept that the OECD 'doctored' its reports. I think the report was an honest assessment by the OECD of things as they saw them at the time', he said. The consultative procedures with Australia about the draft were exactly the same as the procedures in previous years'. Other variations included-"
"10000","Order! It is now 15 minutes to one o'clock. In accordance with Standing Order 106, the debate is interrupted. I put the question:"
"10000","Mr Speaker has received letters from both the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) and the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by Standing Order 107, he has selected one matter, that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Port Adelaide, namely:"
"EE6","From the speech of the honourable gentleman one could say, not unreasonably, that he forgot the matter which he proposed to this House as a matter of public importance. He sought to attack me as Minister and the Government because of what I said yesterday at Question Time concerning my request to the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs to report to me on the application of the work test in respect of work for casual fruit pickers which is available in the Shepparton and Mildura districts. I said then, and I say again, that I expect that many people in the community—taxpayers—ask themselves, properly, whether when work of this kind is available they should be paying, by way of tax, unemployment benefit to people who are fit and able to take that work but who decline to go to the place where the work is available. That report is coming to me from my department. The honourable gentleman alleged that when I answered the question on this matter yesterday I had no information from my department on it. I assure the House that I had information—written material—from my department which I had requested some days before. I have been looking at this matter for some days, since the first Press reports about the situation at Mildura appeared. The honourable gentleman also accused the Government of taking the action that I spoke about yesterday because the Government expected that the Budget appropriation for unemployment benefits would be overspent by $100m. I assure the House that that is a completely false accusation. I remind the House that during the years of the Whitlam regime the Labor Government considerably overspent against the Budget appropriation for unemployment benefit payments. I shall quickly run through the figures. In 1972-73 there was an over expenditure of $12.6m. In 1973-74 the figure was $16.9m. In 1974-75—a Labor year—the figure was $116.7m. In 1975-76—predominantly a Labor year—the over expenditure was $184.8m. In 1976-77 the over expenditure was $161.1m and in 1977-78 it was $154.1m. In other words, there is a pattern of over expenditure against Budget appropriation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which has been prepared by the Department of Social Security. Leave granted. The table read as follows- I thank the House. I also point out to the House some relevant statistics concerning the character of beneficiaries of unemployment benefit payments. The honourable member for Port Adelaide sought to wring out the last drop of what he thought was blood from his argument. He alleged that it was most unreasonable for the community to expect people to travel to Mildura or Shepparton seeking casual work. A survey conducted by the Department of Social Security in December 1978 revealed that 74.7 per cent of all beneficiaries had no dependants. I think that speaks for itself. I am surprised that this matter of public importance has been proposed for discussion today. Only last week the Opposition proposed a similar matter of public importance for discussion. I made clear then the origins of the current levels of employment. I cite again a few of the pertinent figures. In June of 1974 the registered unemployed figure stood at less than 80,000. Twelve months later registered unemployed had reached a quarter of a million. In 12 months the figure had risen to a quarter of a million under the then Labor Government. I shall narrow the figures down so that people may appreciate what happened during that time under that Government. In August 1974 there were 107,000 registered unemployed; in September, 121,000; in October, 150,000; in November, 190,000; in December, 267,000; and in January 1975 the figure was 312,000. Last week I also made it clear that the Government believes that the only way to correct the severe disruption of the Australian economy which occurred as a result of the events of 1973-74 is by way of a prudent non-inflationary managed recovery. The most important contribution government can make to assist the community, to assist those seeking work and to take up the challenge ahead, is to maintain stability in economic management and economic policies. That is not to say that governments should be inflexible or unresponsive to changing circumstances. But for the benefit of investors, business and the work force it must be consistent and re- , liable in the pursuit of effective management of the economy. Undoubtedly the Fraser Government has reassured the business community on that and the condition of industry and the economy have improved markedly as a result. Since the last months of last year we have received the results of surveys and economic statistics which continuously show an improving economy and also an improving employment situation. Today the Commonwealth Statistician released figures which show a substantial increase, in seasonally adjusted terms, in total employment during December. I think it is about time that this House started to pay attention to what is happening in the overall employment field rather than concentrating on unemployment to the exclusion of all other things. I say that not to detract from the significance of unemployment and what needs to be done by the Government and by the community as a whole for those people who at present cannot find the work they want. The significance of the Statistician 's figures is that the increase was no less than 20,000 for the month and follows upon an increase of 17,000 in November. It was the sixth successive month in which employment, in seasonally adjusted terms, had increased. The figure now stands at 57,000 more than the June 1978 figure. Manufacturing employment in seasonally adjusted terms increased for three successive months. Although this brought only a modest increase in employment of 11,000 it is an encouraging sign for manufacturing industry given all that has happened to it in recent years. I turn to some of the other statistics. Civilian employment rose strongly in December 1978—by 20,400 persons. This was the sixth consecutive monthly increase and followed a similar strong rise of 16,900 persons in November. The number of civilian employees at December 1978 was 4,757,400. This is the highest seasonally adjusted figure since October 1974 when it was 4,766,000. The increase for the six months, June to December 1978, was 56,000. This was the largest increase since the six months, June to December 1973, when the figure was 135,000. The increase for the month of December 1978 is the largest increase since the month of December 1973. There is clear evidence that our policies, pursued since we won office in 1975, are bearing fruit not only in the economy generally but in the important area in which I must work—that is, in employment. Let me remind the honourable member for Port Adelaide what his present leader, when Treasurer, said in his Budget speech on 19 August 1975, which is recorded at page 53 in the relevant Hansard. He said:"
"ZJ4","The Bill currently before the House represents a further attempt by the Government to block off an incredibly extensive network of tax avoidance which poses a grave threat to the equity of the entire taxation system and to Government revenue. Accordingly, the Opposition does not oppose this legislation. This Bill gives effect to previous statements by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), the first dating from 19 April last year, a full 10 months ago, announcing measures to block off tax avoidance schemes involving the pre-payment of interest and rent, trust stripping and trust income derived from overseas. The first of these schemes, that involving pre-payment of interest and rent, aims at securing a tax deduction for a supposedly deductible business expense which, in fact, has been created in a highly artificial manner. For instance, a taxpayer enters a scheme whereby he obtains a loan of $1,000 from an accomplice in the scheme and immediately repays $700 as a pre-payment of interest on the loan. He then buys back the loan for $370 and has obtained a $700 tax deduction for a net outlay of $70, which was the fee to the accomplice in the scheme. Schemes involving the pre-payment of rent operate in a similar way. To overcome these schemes, the Bill will either disallow tax deductions for this type of outgoing or limit the deduction for any year to so much of the total amount as could reasonably be expected to be paid in that year. Opposition is concerned that, although the Treasurer acknowledged in his second reading speech that variations of these schemes had been uncovered since his original Press statement, he has not acted to include those variations in this legislation. Instead, he proposes to introduce even more legislation during this session to deal with the new schemes. This seems to be a further example of the Government's largely ineffective and ad hoc approach to this serious problem. By acting in this way the Treasurer is unnecessarily using up more of Parliament's valuable time and giving the tax avoidance industry even more time to find new ways around the amendment. The second scheme dealt with in this Bill involves trust stripping transactions. Division 6 of the Income Tax Assessment Act taxes trusts according to the principle that the beneficiaries of a trust are liable for tax on any of the trust income to which they are entitled, and if there is any part of the trust income to which no beneficiary is entitled, or if a beneficiary is under a legal disability, then the trustee is liable for tax on that income.Trust stripping schemes aim to remove tax liability from both the trustee and the beneficiary. The schemes rely on imposing a nominal non-taxable beneficiary, such as a charity or a loss company, between the trustee and the true beneficiary. This nominal beneficiary receives the income from the trust and, in exchange for a participation fee, passes it on to the intended beneficiary in a tax free form such as a collapsable loan' which is a loan that is not intended to be repaid. To overcome these schemes the legislation looks for the existence of some sort of reimbursement agreement whereby the nominal beneficiary receives a share of trust income in exchange for the provision of money, loans or any other benefit in return. In these circumstances the amount of trust income involved will be treated as if there is no beneficiary entitled to receive it and will be taxed to the trustee at the maximum rate of 6VA per cent. This type of scheme highlights a fact which the Opposition views with considerable alarm, and that is the increasing use of charitable organisations in tax avoidance schemes. It is appalling that these institutions should allow their tax exempt status to be used as vehicles for such schemes. The Treasurer has several times acknowledged that charities are allowing themselves to be used in this way and warned them against it. If these warnings are to be effective they must be backed up by strict action against any such group that abuses its tax exempt status by participating in these artificial and immoral schemes. The third part of this Bill deals with the foreign source income of trusts. At present a trustee is not taxable on any accrued trust income which originates overseas. This is due to a High Court decision in the Union Fidelity case of 1969. Once again, the learned judges in the High Court acted to frustrate Parliament's intentions in tax legislation and put their stamp of approval on the loss of a considerable amount of revenue. The non-taxability of foreign source income is due primarily to confusion over the residence of a trust. To overcome this problem, the legislation defines a 'resident trust' so that a trust can be treated in the same way as a 'resident taxpayer' and can be assessed on both foreign and Australian source income. Measures are included to ensure that beneficiaries are also taxed on both overseas and local income, that non-residents are only taxed on Australian income and that double taxation is avoided. However, these particular measures are stillborn. This is due totally to the Government's unwillingness to introduce a foreign tax credit scheme for the taxing of foreign source income, despite the fact that it originally announced that it intended to introduce such a scheme. Under sub-section 23(9) of the Income Tax Assessment Act any foreign source income received by an Australian resident is exempt from Australian tax if it has been taxed at all, even at one per cent, overseas. So to overcome the proposed amendment a trustee merely has to arrange to have foreign income channelled through a company set up in a tax haven country where it will be taxed at low rates and then remitted to Australia exempt from further tax. Therefore, this amendment will be no more than a minor irritant to determined tax avoiders. The need for a foreign tax credit system was referred to by the Treasurer in his original statement on 8 June last year when he proposed this amendment. Now he conveniently ignores the consequences of not having that system. By capitulating to powerful business interests which lobbied against the tax credit proposal, which is certainly what happened, the Treasurer ensured that this proposed amendment would be ineffective and that a substantial area of tax avoidance could not be closed off. The Opposition recognises the inequities and revenue losses which result from these types of tax avoidance schemes and it acknowledges the necessity for appropriate amendments to overcome them. However, whilst supporting the Government's amendments, the Opposition doubts that they will have more than a superficial impact on the tax avoidance industry. Indeed, the industry is openly claiming that it has already defeated the amendments on foreign trust income and will probably soon be able to by-pass the other amendments. That is how effective these amendments are. Indeed, that is the story of most of the Government's efforts to date to stop tax avoidance. No sooner is one scheme stopped when another takes its place. In our view, it is time that the Government made a concerted and effective attack on tax avoidance. As we have stressed in earlier debates on this subject, such a concerted attack must involve action in various areas which are currently not being utilised. Section 260 of the Act, the annihilation provision, on the face of it, declares tax avoidance schemes to be illegal but it has been interpreted in such a way by the High Court as to be meaningless. Surely it must be rewritten in an attempt to draw it in such a way that the High Court will have to uphold it and find tax avoidance schemes to be illegal. Retrospectivity is another measure which we have advocated as a means which could be used to devastate the tax avoidance industry. Certainly, from our understanding of people in that industry, there is no doubt that this is something which they greatly fear. At the moment all we have is that the Treasurer announced a scheme on a certain day, apparently as soon as he found out that this scheme was causing loss of revenue, then at some later date he introduced legislation to block off the scheme which was causing the loss of revenue and he backdated the legislation to the date of his announcement. We have said that there is absolutely no reason why that retrospectivity of legislation should go back not just to the date of announcement but, indeed, to the beginning of the financial year involved. That seems to us to be an utterly defensible action for the Government to take. It does not involve drastic retrospectivity; it involves simply going back to the beginning of the financial year in which the income is being earned, on which tax is to be paid or avoided. The third measure which we have mentioned previously as being important for the Government to undertake in this area is for it to ban the advertising of tax avoidance schemes. I repeat, this is something which ought to be done. Lately the papers are full of whole page advertisements by various people claiming to have tax avoidance schemes. These advertisements encourage people to get into the tax avoidance business. All these schemes are highly artificial. On the face of it, they should be banned under section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. But, as I mentioned, that section is inoperative. So people are encouraged to get involved in these artificial schemes and the whole industry gathers impetus because of the advertisements which the Government continues to allow. It seems to us that it would be possible to ban the advertising of such tax avoidance schemes. That ought to be done. However, . even if these measures were adopted, one major method of tax avoidance would still be available unless further action was taken to eliminate it. I refer to the use of trusts as a tax avoidance device. The fact is that, despite the provisions in this Bill in regard to trusts and despite earlier legislation aimed at reducing the effectiveness of trusts in tax avoidance, trusts remain a major means of avoiding personal and company tax. Trusts have long been a means of avoiding estate duty, but that will soon be unimportant following the cessation of estate duty as from the middle of this year. Substantial evidence of the increasing use of trusts for tax avoidance is available. I refer firstly to some statistics which show a rapid increase in the use of trusts. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows statistics for partnerships, trusts and taxable companies over recent years, which was taken from the taxation statistics of the Commissioner of Taxation. Leave granted. The document read as follows- I thank the House. This table shows that between 1973-74 and 1975-76—unfortunately, that is the latest financial year for which statistics are available—the number of partnerships increased by 5.5 per cent, the number of taxable companies declined by 8.3 per cent, but the number of trusts increased by 16.9 per cent. So certainly the number of trusts increased at a much faster rate than did partnerships or companies. In regard to the net income of partnerships, trusts and companies, we find that for companies taxable income increased by 18.8 per cent in that 2-year period; for partnerships the taxable income increased by 15.4 per cent; but for trusts the increase in income in that 2-year period was 83.1 per cent. So not only was there a substantial increase in the number of trusts, particularly compared with partnerships and companies being formed at that time, but also when one looks at the income being channelled through trusts one sees that there was an absolute explosion of such income in that 2-year period. There is very good reason to presume that that trend has continued and that, in fact, the pace might even have quickened since 1975-76. As evidence I refer honourable members to a memo which has come into my hands. It is a Treasury memo, headed 'Income Tax: Tax Avoidance by the use of Inter-Vivos Trusts'. It is numbered J/78/239 Pt. 1 and is dated 3 November 1977. This memo, as its heading indicates, addresses itself to the whole issue of tax avoidance through the use of trusts. The first paragraph states:"
"ZJ4","The Deputy Commissioner's observation of the proliferation of trading trusts is, of course, consistent with the information being obtained from other States and warrants immediate legislative action being taken. If the use of trading trusts continues to proliferate, it is inevitable that salary and wage earners will have to bear the burden of meeting the loss of revenue from partnership and private company sources. The effects of such a redistribution of the taxation burden would be extremely far-reaching in terms of overall consumption demand, would provide a disincentive to the salary and wage earner to earn higher wages, and, most importantly, would give the entrepreneur and businessman an unfair and inequitable tax advantage over the salary and wage earner."
"ZJ4","Those are two tremendously important paragraphs. Both the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Melbourne, in his memo of January 1977, and the Treasury memo in November 1977 say explicitly and clearly that while we continue to allow trusts, particularly trading trusts, to be used as a major tax avoidance device, an enormous inequity will be created in the tax system and wage and salary earners will be carrying a much larger share of the burden than would otherwise be the case. That is, of course, something about which we on this side of the House feel very strongly and about which we suggest the Government also should feel strongly. The fact that it has taken very little action in this area, acting only on the periphery rather than at the heart of the problem, means that it is not acting in a way which is being indicated to it by the Deputy Commissioners of Taxation and by the Treasury itself that it should act. I will give some further evidence of the importance of what is being said there. If we look at what has happened to the amount of income tax revenue from pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, who are wage and salary earners, and from non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers over the last two years we can see how the burden is shifting continuously onto wage and salary earners. In 1976-77 PAYE tax revenue was $8,529m. It increased by 21 per cent over the next two years to $10,341m, which is the estimated figure for 1978-79. But for non-PAYE taxation the increase that is expected over that two-year period is 2.9 per cent. So the point that is being made in that Treasury memo is borne out by the statistics which are in front of us, that is, that the whole tax burden is being shifted inexorably over to wage and salary earners because of the failure of the Government to lop off the means of tax avoidance for non-PAYE taxpayers. This is something that is scandalous and about which there needs to be much greater community awareness and concern. Wage and salary earners generally should demand of this Government that it take the action necessary to stop this continuation of their bearing a higher portion of the tax burden and to restore equity in the tax system by making nonPAYE taxpayers pay their fair share of the tax. The way in which trusts can be used to avoid tax is something to which I would like to refer very briefly. One way is simply by income splitting, by diverting one's income through trusts towards children. There are great tax advantages to be had by distributing trust income in that way. As the law currently stands, any income of a child beneficiary up to a total of $16,608 is taxed at 33 1/2 per cent and at only 47 1/2 per cent up to $33,216. If the father is taxed at the maximum marginal rate of 61 1/2 per cent, he can still save a lot of tax by putting his income through a trust for distribution to his children who then pay tax at a much lower rate. In this way he avoids substantial amounts of tax. Of course, the interesting point is that the parents can still utilise that income, perhaps to some degree by normal parental control over the financial affairs of their children but, if that is too blatant, the Australian Taxation Office can then demand that higher tax be paid. But there is a more sophisticated way around that. The children may lend the money back to the trusts- that is, another collapsible loan; one not intended for repayment- which increases the capital of the trusts. The parents can then demand repayment of their loan from the trust capital and such supposed repayments are then tax free. So the parents have channelled income to the children who have paid tax at a much lower rate and then the money comes back to the parents through the supposed repayments of the loan. In this way previously taxable income from an asset can be converted into nontaxable capital receipts, and nothing has been done to stop that. Trading trusts, as I have mentioned, are responsible for the greatest loss of tax revenue through the avoidance of company tax. The manner in which this occurs is that a profitable business or family income is sold to a unit trust which has been set up to operate the business and receive all income. The beneficiaries are usually the shareholders of the former company or the owner and his wife and children. Generally a $2 company will be set up as a trustee with the previous owners as directors so that they will maintain control of the business. The beneficiaries receive the distributed profits of the business and are taxed at personal income tax rates. In this way normal company tax on company profits, that is, 46 per cent, is totally avoided. Of course, that makes trading trusts enormously attractive to businessmen who wish to avoid the payment of company tax, which presumably is most of them. Service trusts have become a popular means of reducing tax liabilities by the alienation of professional income. In some cases a unit trust can be set up to take over a professional business which has previously been conducted as a partnership. The previous partners are then employed by the trust which runs the business and pays the profits to the discretionary family trusts of the partners. However, many professional practices cannot be run in this way because the ethics of the particular profession do not allow businesses to be conducted by a trust. In such cases the Commissioner of Taxation would disallow the use of trusts to reduce tax. However, to get around that problem many professional persons set up a service trust to carry on the non-professional activities of their practice. In one particular case the scheme involved a large firm of chartered accountants transferring the firms clerical and secretarial activities and staff to a unit trust which then provided the services back to the firm at commercial rates. The firm's office furniture and equipment was also transferred to the trust and leased back to the firm. The firm obtained tax deductions under section 5 1 through payment to the trust for these services. The trust then declared dividends out of the profits from providing the services and paid them to its unit holders who were the partners' families or family companies. This scheme was upheld by the Federal Court last year. Quite clearly that is a very convenient way in which professions can bring about a great avoidance of income tax. To be fair, the Government has taken some action in regard to trusts, but it has fiddled around only at the edges of the problem despite the clear advice from the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury that they are major and proliferating means of tax avoidance. For instance, section 99A of the Income Tax Assessment Act applies a penalty rate of tax to income accumulated in a trust where no beneficiary is presently entitled to a share of that trust income. This system was designed to prevent tax avoidance through trusts but left loopholes in that the penalty rate was only 50 per cent rather than the maximum rate of personal income tax of 61 1/2 per cent, as it is now, and deceased estates were excluded from its coverage. Both these loopholes have been covered by amendments in recent years. Similarly, under section 98 and section 99 taxation of trustees in respect of income for a beneficiary under 16 years of age has been increased somewhat, so reducing the scope for income splitting to some degree but by no means eliminating the advantages of income splitting. For high income people there is still a very great advantage to be obtained in channelling income to their children rather than earning it directly themselves and having to pay the maximum marginal rate of tax on it. The present legislation to overcome trust splitting schemes and non-taxability of foreign source income of trusts are further examples of the Government's dealing with the problem at the periphery, and fairly innocuously at that, rather than tackling the whole problem head on. The basic reason for the ineffectiveness of the present Act to prevent tax avoidance through trusts is the acceptance by the law that income splitting of profits and investment income is a permissible activity. So long as the law does not challenge that, trusts will be a major means of tax avoidance. I will come back to that later if there is time. Even within that basic assumption of the law there are grave deficiencies in the existing Act regarding provisions which are meant to limit or restrict the degree of income splitting that is feasible. In section 102 of Division 6 there was thought to be a major deterrent to tax avoidance through income splitting by providing for penalty tax to be paid where income is payable for the benefit of unmarried children under 21 from a trust created by the children's parents. The penalty was an additional tax to raise the tax on that income to what it would have had it been added to the parents' taxable income. This section has been largely ineffective for two reasons. Firstly, the High Court ruled in 1957 that section 102 did not apply if a child was only contingently entitled to income from the trust, that is, if property was settled on the trust for an infant subject to his attaining, say, the age of 25 or marrying before that age. Any income accumulated in the trust in this case would not be taxable under section 102. Of course, trusts are now structured to get around that problem and to get around this section which was supposed to overcome tax avoidance in this way. Also in 1970 the High Court in what is known as Truesdale's Case also ruled that the section had no application if the trust is created by someone other than the parent or the child beneficiary. This would rule out the application of section 102 in the usual case- very much the usual case now- where a settler creates the trust with a nominal amount and the parent then transfers assets to the trust for the benefit of his own children. Of course, that is the way all trusts are created now. The section is utterly ineffective and a similar situation applies to section 99A. What could the Government be doing about trusts? What it could be doing is paying more attention to what its advisers are saying. The following statement is made on page 7 of the Treasury memo, under the heading Recommendations ':"
"N/A","Mr Justice Murphy goes on to say:"
"N/A","Mr Justice Murphy concludes:"
"BV4","Indeed. I thank my friend, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), for his interjection. The point that I make is that there are more intelligent people than myself in the chamber who are more qualified than myself and who can perhaps answer these queries. I say this not by way of getting out from under before the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) speaks, but perhaps he has looked at these provisions and considered the matters raised by Mr Webb and Dr Spry. He has not yet spoken in the debate. The comments I made about the previous speakers do not apply to him. Having made that position quite clear, I say clearly and unequivocally that tax evasion must be stamped out because every dollar of tax evaded is an extra dollar which has to be raised from the non-evaders, if I might use that expression. I must say that I have sympathy for the argument, which I hear repeatedly in the community, that whilst some people are able to evade their tax obligations involving large amounts—which is of course illegal—the ordinary working man in the majority of cases is not in a position to avoid or evade. So we are on common ground in relation to that matter. The prepayment of rent and interest is a contrived means of evasion. It hides the real nature of the transaction, it has the nature of fraud behind it and in my view it must be stamped out. The matters raised by both Mr Webb and Dr Spry in relation to the very substantial penalty which follows an assessment that there has been an evasion of tax, which is illegal under this Bill, should bring home the enormity of the problems facing large corporations. Some corporations might very well find that an enormous project involving millions of dollars and the welfare and livelihood of thousands of Australians could be placed in jeopardy because if a breach of section 82KH or section 82KJ of the Act were discovered the entire tax deductibility would disappear. The amount of tax evaded may be comparatively small and the total tax deduction available to the corporation could be 10, 20 or 50 times greater than the amount involved. The capacity is therefore of considerable importance because if that situation developed the company might very well become bankrupt overnight. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the tax laws which I submit are quasi-criminal to the extent that penalties of a very substantial nature are likely to be imposed in respect of breaches—must be clear and specific. I can say only that I find it very difficult to understand with clarity and precision some of the drafting provisions of this Bill. What in fact is a 'benefit'? I invite the honourable member for Hawker or any other member who can clearly explain this definition to me to do so. I do not believe that in certain areas of the Act the precision that ought to be is there. I repeat that I am not an expert; this is not a field in which I have practised at any stage of my life. I did not reach such heights. But those who do practise in the area say that there is a very great need for clarity and precision because if a person offends that person must pay the penalty. The penalty could be very substantial indeed. It has been drawn to my attention that a mining company for example, might spend $1m developing an ore body and producing copper concentrate. It would be entitled to expect some deduction for the expenditure. It might come to an agreement with a subsidiary to market the concentrate for a fee. Unless the fee is in line with market practices it becomes part of the property passing back as it is paid to an associate. But here is the slug: The company will or could lose its entire Sim development deduction even if the fee charged was only $100. 1 understand that the Mount Newman Mining Company Pty Ltd makes payments to Amax Exploration (Australia) Inc., for marketing, to the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd for operating and to the CSR Co. Ltd for Canberra liaison. If the Australian Taxation Office ruled that the transaction came within section 82KJ of the Act, the Mount Newman Co. could lose every tax deduction to which it would otherwise be entitled particularly as the legislation is retrospective to 19 April 1978. What would the effect of that be? The effect of that might well be to bankrupt the company and put hundreds of Australians out of jobs. I simply use that as an example. My colleague from Western Australia who interjected earlier will know what I am talking about. The implications for major companies in Australia, should they make a mistake under this law, could be very substantial indeed. I repeat that I am not opposing the legislation. I am simply expressing the need for absolute clarity and precision. Many agreements made between companies and their employees could endanger the whole enterprise. It is critical that the precise details, the precise implications of the legislation should be clearly stated and clearly debated, if not in this House, in the Senate, if not in the Senate, before a legislation committee. It is a matter about which I believe there is some genuine concern by many people. I am not referring to tax evaders, or crooks, but to many decent members of the community who would like to have the exact details spelled out chapter and verse so that there is no risk of injustice occurring and in particular no risk of any damage being done to the economic situation of this country. I refer particularly to the area of employment where we are dealing with major employers and large corporations. The ordinary man in the street will probably wonder what the devil we have been talking about this afternoon. The fact is that this legislation is not going to apply to the ordinary man in the street. This Bill has little if any practical application to probably 96 per cent of the Australian population. That figure could even be 99 per cent."
"CV4","I support this Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. However, I do so with a deep sense of cynicism. Last March, in speaking in the Address-in-Reply debate I made the following remarks:"
"CV4","The other thing to which I draw the attention of the House is that there was a very important report tabled in the British Parliament in the latter part of 1977. It is a disturbing report, because it clearly indicates that in Britain there is a greater and greater aggregation of wealth in fewer and fewer hands. Many of the decisions of this Government in relation to death duties, succession duties and so forth do nothing more than create that position in Australia. As long as the Government's policies in this area continue, that aggregation will happen in this country. As a layman it seems to me to be a case of bad drafting or lack of foresight on the part of the Government or its advisers. One gains the impression that piecemeal legislation to protect the revenue from dividend strippers and other forms of tax dodging is never ending. Regrettably, the organisers of tax dodging schemes always seem to be one step ahead of the Commissioner of Taxation. In these days of staff ceilings this situation is inevitable; the Commissioner of Taxation simply does not have the investigators and other necessary staff available to fight tax avoidance schemes. This Government stands condemned on that ground alone; I do not condemn the Commissioner of Taxation or his staff. As a result of this Government's frugality, hundreds of millions of dollars are being lost and the Taxation Office is fighting a losing battle with one hand tied behind its back. Even if staff were readily available to combat these attacks on the revenue the Commissioner would still frequently lag behind in the discovery of such schemes. It would not be unusual for a scheme to remain undiscovered until, as I understand it, an assessor in the ordinary course of his duties noticed an unusual claim for a deduction in a return of income. This discovery could take place as long as 18 months or even longer after the scheme was first implemented. In these circumstances, by the time the loophole is closed by legislative action, as much as three years could have elapsed since the tax dodging arrangement was first utilised. On the other hand, if staff were readily available outside inquiries could be made constantly in professional quarters and professional journals could be examined to find out what new schemes were being sold by vendors of tax dodging arrangements. I feel that one answer to this problem is the strengthening of a blanket provision such as section 260. If such action were practicable, and I do not see why it would not be, the tax dodger would always have something to fear if he engaged in outlandish tax dodging arrangements. Honourable members will possibly recall the time when section 260 had some teeth, and, even if it was not always 100 per cent effective, it still represented a substantial threat. Honourable members will recall that in a recent speech I pointed out that over recent years section 260 had been completely denigrated by the High Court under Sir Garfield Barwick, and I make no apology for that statement. This has been apparent for some years but the situation has worsened in recent times. It ought to be remembered that the Chief Justice practised as a leader of the Sydney Bar and, beyond question, built up a reputation for giving final approval to tax dodging schemes submitted by solicitors—"
"ZD4","by leave—I wish to inform the House of a further step in the Government's ongoing program of curbing tax avoidance practices. In doing so, I emphasise to the Parliament the determination of this Government to maintain maximum pressure against such practices. In my statement of 24 September 1978, I foreshadowed amendments to the income tax law to deny deductions for specified types of expenditure incurred as part of tax avoidance schemes or arrangements that involve the effective recoupment of the expenditure so that no real deductible loss or outgoing is suffered by the taxpayer. In addition to saying that the amendments specifically foreshadowed in my statement of 24 September were to apply from that date where the relevant expenditure is incurred in discharging a mortgage, in the acquisition of trading stock or by way of interest or rent, I gave a clear warning to tax avoidance promoters that the proposed amendments would be made to apply, also with effect from 24 September, to any further schemes exhibiting similar recoupment features. It has now come to the attention of the Government that, despite this warning, expenditure recoupment schemes claimed to produce deductions for expenditure in borrowing money to be used to produce assessable income are being marketed. These schemes exploit the provisions of section 67 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which authorises deductions for procuration fees or other expenditures incurred by a taxpayer in borrowing money used for the purpose of producing assessable income. Stated broadly, deductions are spread over the period of the loan, or over 5 years, whichever is the lesser. By way of example of the complicated schemes developed to exploit this special provision, I mention a scheme under which a tax avoidance promoter undertakes, for a fee of 15 per cent of the tax deduction sought, to arrange a loan of $185,000 for a taxpayer for a period of 6 months for a purported 'procuration fee' of $100,000. The loan of $185,000 is made from a trust controlled by the promoter. It is this fee of $100,000, $85,000 of which is effectively recouped to the taxpayer that is claimed to be a deductible expense in terms of section 67 of the Act. The $185,000 borrowed is in turn invested by the taxpayer in a second trust which on-lends the money to a company controlled by the first trust. The first trust then lends the taxpayer a further $185,000 for a 30-year term and the initial loan is repaid out of this. The effect of the circular loans and repayments effected by round-robins' of cheques is that the $185,000 liability of the taxpayer to the first trust is matched by the liability of the company controlled by that trust to the second trust which is in turn liable to the taxpayer for that amount. The result of these complex arrangements is that it is possible for the liabilities in respect of each loan to be forgiven at a future date without adverse consequences for any of the parties. Because the procuration fee of $100,000 is claimed to be payable in respect of the original 6-month loan, the taxpayer claims that the fee is fully deductible in one year. The arrangements are made in such a way that the bulk of the procuration fee is recouped by the taxpayer by the provision of a loan that is never intended to be repaid. This is achieved by the first trust lending to the taxpayer, in addition to the other loans, $85,000 interest free and nominally repayable at call. However, because the tax avoidance promoter invests the $100,000 procuration fee with that trust in the form of redeemable units that the trust subsequently redeems for $15,000, the $85,000 loan is effectively recouped by the trust with the result that it is then able to forgive the taxpayer's liability in respect of the loan without any effective loss to itself. The taxpayer thus claims to be entitled to a deduction for income tax purposes in respect of a $100,000 procuration fee. Of that amount he effectively outlays only $15,000, and that represents the fee payable to the tax avoidance promoter. The amendments dealing with recoupment schemes foreshadowed in my statement of 24 September are to be made applicable to deductions claimed in respect of borrowing expenses under these tax avoiding arrangements. The Government is thereby giving substance to the clear warning that had been extended to tax avoidance promoters against implementing substitute recoupment schemes. The amendments will mean that a deduction will not be available for expenditure incurred after 24 September 1978 in respect of the borrowing of money where that expenditure is incurred as part of a tax avoidance scheme or arrangement that involves the receipt by a taxpayer, or an associate, of a compensating benefit the value of which, when added to the tax benefit or advantage, effectively recoups the taxpayer for the expenditure so that no real deductible loss or outgoing is suffered. Legislation to give effect to the Government's latest proposals will be introduced this session. The action taken by the Government in the present case should spell out in the clearest possible terms the Government's resolve to prevent the marketing of any further 'expenditure recoupment' schemes. Should this not be the result of this further announcement, the Government will not hesitate to act again to amend the income tax law to counter any other schemes exhibiting similar features. Any further necessary amendments would, as with the amendments in the present case, and in accordance with my earlier warning, apply to losses or outgoings incurred after 24 September 1978. I commend the statement to the House."
"ID4","The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's proposals for the reform of the repatriation appeal system. Honourable members will remember that, early in 1977, the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator the Honourable Peter Durack, announced that the Government had decided to transfer the functions of the existing repatriation appeal tribunals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Subsequent detailed examination revealed substantial practical problems in giving effect to this decision. The Government has therefore decided to establish, with effect from 1 July 1979, a separate and independent Repatriation Review Tribunal which will combine the functions of the present war pensions entitlement appeal tribunals and the assessment appeal tribunals. The concept of an independent tribunal, combining the functions of both of the current repatriation tribunals was proposed by Mr Justice Toose in his Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System. The present repatriation appeals system has now been in operation for just under 50 years. It was established by the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 1929, which came into operation on 1 June 1929. The first sitting of an appeal tribunal under that Act was held on 5 June 1929. It is interesting to note that the basic provisions inserted into the Repatriation Act by this 1929 amendment remain intact today, subject only to a few amendments. For example, the rights of unsuccessful appellants to seek reopening of their cases by presentation of further evidence and the right of appellants to have access to information in the records relating to their case were inserted in the 1929 Act. Like other basic provisions in the legislation, these remain in force today. I am sure that the clause dealing with the applicant's right to have access to information from his records must have seemed revolutionary in 1929. The last decade has seen major developments in the field of administrative law, leading to the passage through this Parliament of significant legislative enactments such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to reform the repatriation appeal tribunal system so that it accords with modern principles of administrative law. The proposed Repatriation Review Tribunal is modelled in many respects on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and will function in a somewhat similar manner. Its role will be to review decisions which are the subject of applications before it, rather than to rehear claims or applications as is done in the existing repatriation appeal system. Under the existing repatriation appeal system there are four Entitlement Appeal Tribunals and four Assessment Appeal Tribunals. Each of these Tribunals is a separate, independent, final authority, with nothing to ensure consistency as between tribunals in their decisions or in their interpretations of the law. The establishment of the proposed single Repatriation Review Tribunal will strengthen the administration of the appeal system and facillitate the development of just and consistent decision-making. One of the deficiencies of the present system is the absence of a specific right for parties to obtain access to a court of law to seek clarification of issues of law. The Bill provides for a right of access to the Federal Court of Australia on questions of law. The Tribunal may, of its own motion, or at the request of an applicant or the Repatriation Commission, refer a question of law arising in proceedings before it to the Federal Court. Additionally, there will be a right of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on a question of law after a case has been decided by the Tribunal. This right may be exercised by either the applicant or the Repatriation Commission. Provision is also made to assist financially applicants who may be involved in a proceeding before the Federal Court. Where the President of the Tribunal, of his own volition or on the application of one of the parties, refers a question of law to the Federal Court of Australia, the costs of the applicant will be met by the Commonwealth. If the Repatriation Commission appeals to the Federal Court on a question of law, the applicant's costs will also be met by the Commonwealth. While the Bill provides a discretion in the Federal Court of Australia as to costs where an unsuccessful applicant before the Tribunal pursues an appeal to the Federal Court on a question of law, provision is made for an applicant to apply to the Attorney-General for assistance. In addition to providing a right of access to the Federal Court of' Australia on questions of law, the Bill also contains a special provision which will enable certain matters before the Repatriation Review Tribunal involving issues of important principle of general application under the Repatriation Act to be referred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This recognises the central nature of that Tribunal within the Commonwealth's sphere of administrative law. While incorporating these present day principles for the review of administrative decisions, the Bill seeks to retain the best elements of the existing system- in particular those elements which confer upon applicants special rights and privileges. For example, the Bill retains the concept embodied in the existing appeal system that an unsuccessful applicant who subsequently collects further evidence which was not placed before the Tribunal at an earlier hearing may have his case reopened by submitting such further evidence. Similarly, the right of the Repatriation Commission to reopen a case decided unfavourably to an applicant is retained. On the other hand, the Bill limits the powers of the Repatriation Commission in reviewing cases under section 31 of the principal Act. It spells out legislatively the limitations on the Commission's powers which have developed as a result of interpretations given, over the years, on the existing provisions of the Act. For example, as a result of these amendments, the Commission will be unable to review under section 31 an entitlement which has arisen as a result of a successful application by a person to the Tribunal. The fact that these limitations will now be spelled out in the legislation rather than depend upon interpretation is a major improvement in the legislation. For the benefit of honourable members, I have distributed an explanatory memorandum on the provisions of the Bill. Honourable members will note in the schedule to that memorandum a comparative list of the existing provisions and the equivalent provisions which are incorporated in the Bill. I turn now, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the more important provisions of this Bill. The Bill provides for the repeal, with effect from 1 July 1979, of Divisions 2 to 4 inclusive of Part III of the principal Act which make provision for the present tribunals and deal with appeals to those tribunals. Clause 26 inserts in the Act a new Part IIIA dealing with the Repatriation Review Tribunal and proceedings before it, a new Part IIIB dealing with references to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and a new Part IIIC dealing with references and appeals to the Federal Court of Australia. The right to apply to the new Tribunal for review of a decision is set out in the proposed section 107VC in respect of entitlement matters, the proposed section 107VD in respect of assessment matters and the proposed section 107VE in respect of a refusal to grant a service pension on the grounds of permanent unemployability. These provisions mirror the present sub-sections 64 (1), 67 (1) and 70 (1) of the Act. There will be no formalities in the method of applying for a review. The proposed section 107VF simply requires that an application shall be in writing; set out a statement of the reasons for the application; and be lodged with the Secretary, Department of Veterans' Affairs. The procedure will be the same as has been successfully operated for the last 50 years, in that the applicant will forward his application for review to the Department in the same way as he has lodged his original claim and his appeal to the Commission. He does not have to search out the Tribunal or a proper authority, such as a registrar, to lodge his application. The Secretary will be required, under the proposed section 107VF, to notify the President of the Tribunal of the lodgement of the application, and subsequently forward to the President all the appropriate documents and records. The provisions in the Bill relating to applications for review on entitlement matters are identical, in effect, to those contained in the present Act. Under the Bill, the procedure in an assessment hearing will now be the same as that which has been successful in the entitlement area. In the past, the appellant would appear before an Assessment Appeal Tribunal where his case would be reheard in terms of evidence produced, supplemented usually with an 'on the spot' medical examination by the medical members of the Tribunal. Under the legislation proposed in this Bill, the Repatriation Review Tribunal will be required to review the decision of the Board and either affirm that decision or set it aside. If it sets the decision aside, the Tribunal will substitute a decision it considers to be in accordance with the Act. The Bill provides for the Tribunal to consist of a president, a number of deputy presidents and a number of members. The President will be responsible for the efficient operation of the Tribunal. He will be empowered to give directions for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the operations of the Tribunal and as to the arrangement of its business. He will be required to give directions from time to time as to the persons who are to constitute the Tribunal for the purpose of conducting reviews in pursuance of applications for reviews. In hearing an application for review of a decision, the Tribunal shall consist of the President or a deputy president, a Services member and one other man. When a matter before the Tribunal relates to an application for review of an assessment decision the third member will be a medical practitioner. Services members will be members who are appointed by the Governor-General from lists of names submitted by organisations representing returned soldiers. The procedures of the Tribunal will be informal, as they now are, and the President will be empowered to give directions as to procedures. In the absence of a particular direction, the presiding member in a particular proceeding may give direction as to the procedures to be followed. I draw the attention of honourable members, however, to the provisions of the proposed sub-section 107W (3) which requires the President or the presiding member in a particular case, when giving direction as to procedures, to have regard to the need for the proceedings before the Tribunal to be conducted with as little formality and technicality and with as much expedition as the requirements of the Repatriation Act and a proper consideration of the matters before the Tribunal permit. This is an important principle, as it spells out in the legislation the requirement that formal proceedings and technical concepts are to be avoided. The hearing of a proceeding will be in private, as are the hearings of the present Repatriation Appeal Tribunals. However, the Bill provides that a presiding member at a hearing may permit the hearing or a part of the hearing to take place in public if so requested by the applicant. This is an important departure from the current tribunal arrangements. The amendment of the principal Act to insert these new provisions in respect of the new Tribunal has necessitated a number of consequential amendments of the Repatriation Act and associated Acts. I have already referred to the amendment of section 31 of the principal Act to specify legislatively the limitations on the Repatriation Commission's power to review decisions. There are some other consequential amendments including amendments to section 47 of the principal Act which is, of course, an important provision specifying the principles upon which determining authorities under the Repatriation Act are to reach their decisions. The amendments which have been made to this section are only necessary in order to encompass the new Tribunal within their framework and require the new Tribunal to apply the same principles as are applied by the other determining authorities under the Act. The amendments do not in any way change the original concepts underlying section 47. Similarly, section 47A of the principal Act has been amended. This section has provided authority for the making of regulations requiring prescribed determining authorities to give reasons for their decisions. With the enactment of this legislation, all determining authorities under the Repatriation Act, repatriation boards, the Repatriation Commission and the Repatriation Review Tribunal will, from 1 July 1979, be required to give reasons for their decisions in all entitlement and assessment cases. The Act provides for the proposed new Part IIIA constituting the Tribunal to come into operation on the date of assent, while other amendments contained in this Bill will come into operation on 1 July 1979. This will enable appointments to be made to the new Tribunal and members to take up duty so that the Tribunal will be ready to commence operation on 1 July 1979. This will be the date from which applications for review of decisions by the Tribunal may be made. In the meantime, the present provisions in the principal Act relating to Entitlement Appeal Tribunals and Assessment Appeal Tribunals remain in operation. The existing Tribunals will continue hearing and disposing of appeals under the Act until 30 June 1979. The transitional provisions of the Bill provide that any appeal to the existing Tribunals lodged before 1 July 1979 which has not been disposed of by that date shall be treated as an application to the new Repatriation Review Tribunal for a review of a decision. The Tribunal will be empowered to hear and dispose of those applications without the need for the applicant himself to take any action to preserve his rights. The provisions of this Bill contain major reforms within an area of Commonwealth responsibility which directly affects many thousands of Australians. In the year 1977-78, 9,772 appeals were lodged with the present Repatriation Appeal Tribunals. I emphasise once again that the system is being reformed to take account of current-day practices and principles in the field of administrative law. But I also emphasise that the essential principles of the repatriation appeals system- those that have protected appellants and conferred upon them rights to ensure that every opportunity is given to them to achieve justice- are being retained. As I mentioned earlier, most of these were contained in the original Act of 1929 which introduced the present tribunal system, over four decades before those same principles became accepted generally by this Parliament. I pay tribute to the farsighted men of 1929 who developed such an appellate scheme. I wish also to pay tribute to the many men of calibre who over the years have held appointments to the existing Tribunals. Their contribution over 50 years speaks for itself. I am sure that those who are appointed to the new Repatriation Review Tribunal will similarly fill their roles with distinction and honour. I commend the Bill to the House."
"N/A","Debate resumed from 21 February, on motion by Mr Howard:"
"QH4","At the outset I would like to rebut the accusations by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) that none of us on the Labor Party side have had anything to do with the egg industry because we are from city electorates. From city electorates we may be, but the city electorate of Werriwa has probably had more laying hens in it than any other electorate in New South Wales has had for a very long time. Further to that, I grew up on a poultry farm where I lived for the first 33 years of my life. We had some 20,000 or 25,000 chooks for quite a while. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) also had 20,000 hens. So it is a bit of a nonsense to say that we have had no experience with the egg industry. Apart from that, I would like to say that I agreed very much with some of the matters the honourable member for Fadden raised inasmuch as he said there was opposition in some areas of the egg industry to this move to increase the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia levy from $1 to $2. I was on the executive of the Associated Poultry Farmers of Australia for a period and members of that association from New South Wales have contacted me as they represent now the smaller farmers. They have some misgivings and would put forward some qualifications to this Bill which I would hope to touch upon. I think honourable members were appreciative and understanding of the points raised by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). There is a minority of producers in north Queensland. I would think that the Government, its advisers and the Minister could look at the question of exemptions in that area in the future. Hopefully this will be the last increase. But, from what the honourable member for Dawson says, we have here a very special case; and I think something needs to be done about it. The Minister's second reading speech set out the reasons for the legislation. The Opposition, as has been already indicated, does not oppose it. We have already said that at the organisational level the poultry industry by and large goes along with it. The honourable member for Fraser has pointed out the situation in the Australian Capital Territory. Perhaps I could give some background to the poultry industry legislation. At present the Poultry Industry Levy Act, the Poultry Industry Levy Collection Act and the Poultry Industry Assistance Act which came into operation on 1 July 1965 embody a scheme which is designed to give the Australian egg industry an opportunity to achieve a reasonable degree of stability. The scheme is in effect an extension of the States egg marketing arrangements which have been established for many years to a single Australian marketing plan. Within the framework of this scheme, the State egg marketing boards remain autonomous and perform their normal functions of marketing the eggs placed under their control. These boards also act in concert to ensure that the scheme operates with equity for the benefit of the whole of the poultry industry throughout Australia, and this co-ordination and liaison is achieved through the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia whose membership comprises all the members of all State egg marketing boards. As the honourable member for Dawson has pointed out, the farmers in his area have no representation. The Poultry Industry Levy Act is the one that imposes a levy in respect of hens in excess of 20 kept for commercial purposes and which are over six months of age. The levy is imposed on a prescribed day each fortnight and payment is due within 14 days of the day on which it is imposed. The maximum levy was $1 a hen. It has now gone up to $2 a hen. The Poultry Industry Levy Collection Act provides for the collection of this levy. It includes provisions whereby the Commonwealth Government may enter into an arrangement with a State with respect to the collection of the levy in that State on behalf of the Commonwealth by the egg board for that State. The Poultry Industry Assistance Act establishes the Poultry Industry Trust Fund in which are appropriated amounts equal to the amounts collected by way of levy under the Poultry Industry Levy Collection Act. The other main provisions in the Act cover the distribution of the money in the Fund by grants to the States for the financial assistance of the poultry industry and by expenditure on research. We debated amendments to that Act at the end of last year. There is no need to go too much into the mechanisms to any great extent but perhaps we can spend some time on what the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia does. The three Acts that I have already spoken about are in effect the Australian egg marketing scheme which is now embodied in this legislation which was drawn up by the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia. This is the organisation mentioned in the legislation and this scheme is commonly known as the CEMAA scheme. The Council was formed in 1962 by all of the statutory State egg marketing boards to enable the egg industry to act as one body rather than as many separate identities and to speak with one voice on behalf of the egg industry. The Council is comprised of all members of all the State egg marketing boards and 26 of the 40 members of the Council are producers. The Council is recognised by the Commonwealth and State governments as the principal producer organisation representing the Australian egg industry. Under the CEMAA scheme, the State egg marketing boards co-operate in respect of marketing the whole of Australia's commercial egg production. Revenue collected from the federal hen levy is designed to enable producers in all States to share equitably in the cost of the disposal of egg surpluses. As an aside, one may say that there are some distortions in terms of the equity. The scheme has provided a framework within which the Council has guided the industry through periods of record production and by means of budgeting by its constituent boards it has been able to a large extent to dampen down excessively high or low producer and consumer prices. Price levels in 1977-78 were generally higher than in 1976-77. According to figures supplied by the State egg marketing boards the average net price which Australian producers obtained for their eggs in 1977-78 was 70.73c a dozen, an increase of 4.4c a dozen when compared with the previous year's return. Returns were higher in all States except Tasmania where an increase in production resulted in an export surplus. Tasmania normally has little or no export surplus and the influence of the low export price forced down returns to Tasmanian producers. The egg industry has always been self-financing regarding the question of subsidies. However, this legislation refers to the equalisation arrangement whereby export losses are shared supposedly equitably and so that producers receive an average rate of return per dozen or dozen equivalent. The effective equalisation of gross returns has meant that domestic prices have been able to be maintained at a level above export prices. Hence, there has been a consumer transfer which can be regarded as a form of subsidisation. In the past this calculated measure of production has been quite high and higher than at present, as the levels of exports have now declined to some degree. However, while exports and equalisation exist consumers will pay more for eggs in this country than they need to without the farmers themselves necessarily getting any benefit for it. As other honourable members have said in this debate, producers pay for the marketing of their eggs in three ways. They pay the CEMAA levy that we are discussing. They pay State egg board charges and pools, and I believe that some of the pools recently have gone from 4c to 12c a dozen as a result of the fact that the CEMAA levy is not coping with the export losses. The Australian egg board levies a charge for exports which is deducted via the State boards under the Egg Export Charges Act 1947. As I have said, CEMAA was set up to stop interstate trading and this legislation again refers to that factor. The legislation sets out to circumvent section 92 of the Constitution. Interstate trading had to be stopped so that producers could share equally in the export losses and not simply sell their eggs interstate. The device of putting a charge on hens was the way to get around the business whereby previously egg boards put a levy or struck a pool on eggs. Once CEMAA was set up, the States were able to introduce various forms of licensing. This has been a reasonably slow process, but now I think all States have various forms of licensing and quotas. The rationale for lifting the CEMAA levy from $1 to $2 a bird as a maximum—I have been told that it looks like being something like $1.80 a bird immediately—is that this is really an inflationary adjustment. A moment ago I said that the net return on marketing charges for eggs was something like 70.73c a dozen in 1977-78. When this charge was introduced in 1965 at $1 a bird the comparative return was something like 25c to 30c a dozen. So, it can be fairly said that it is an inflationary adjustment. Also, it will prevent pool charges by the State boards going up or it will at least allow the boards, we hope, to take some of the charges off. This inflationary adjustment would be very simple except that exports as a proportion of total production have dropped quite a bit. So we are dealing with an equation in how to find a sum which will equalise export losses and at the same time to establish to what extent that is simply an adjustment for inflation given the production levels and the amount that is exported. Exports at present are about 14 per cent of total production. They have been up to 30 per cent since the establishment of CEMAA. However, at present there are shortages of some grades of eggs and this is causing concern. It is calculated that if there were to be no shortage of eggs we would need approximately a 20 per cent production excess based on domestic consumption, not the 15 per cent that we are presently aiming at. The situation must be stated quite clearly. It will always be difficult to have 60 gram-a-dozen eggs available at all times throughout the year. If we are to avoid shortages in those grades of eggs, we will need a production margin of about 20 per cent. An anomaly that has occurred with CEMAA is that New South Wales and Victoria between them produce about 78 per cent of the eggs for export. Queensland produces another 10 per cent of the eggs for export. So producers in other States have been paying this $1 a bird hen levy to equalise export losses and have not been contributing to the exports themselves. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) referred to that matter in his second reading speech. A concern I also have about the egg industry, apart from these inequities—the judgment lies in the balance between the amount to take account of the inflationary change in money values and the quantities of eggs that we export—is that we seem to have now somewhat of a permanent bureaucracy imposed on the egg industry while the producers as a group are experiencing a rapid decline and a rapid turnover in their numbers. For example, the number of egg producers in New South Wales has dropped to 924 out of 3,370 producers in Australia. That is a rather dramatic decline on what the figure was a few years ago. However, there has been an enormous move towards larger flocks. In New South Wales, 39 of the remaining farms now have over 36 per cent of all the laying hens. On an Australia-wide basis, some 96 farms have over one-third of the total laying flock. The movement is towards larger and larger units. This is just a factor of technology being applied to the industry. There is not a great deal that can be done about it. However, it is a matter that causes the remaining smaller egg producers in the industry a great deal of concern. It is a concern that the Opposition shares. Although production controls have been introduced, the 1977-78 production has increased on the 1976-77 production by approximately 6.11 per cent. As I have already said, even with the controls, exports have shown some tapering off. Way back in 1967-68 the shell egg equivalent was about 30 million dozen eggs exported. The peak was in 1972-73 with 58,550,000 dozen eggs exported. The figure declined in the intervening two years. In 1975-76 it went up again to some 40,000,000 dozen eggs exported. In 1976-77 some 29,000,000 dozen eggs were exported and in 1977-78 again nearly 29,000,000 dozen eggs were exported. It concerns me that with the introduction of licensing arrangements and quotas we are building in and capitalising the protection given to the egg industry. I was told recently that 15,000 birds swapped hands in New South Wales for $13 a bird egg quota. A quota is transferable and this explains to some extent the way in which the industry is centring in fewer and fewer hands. In Queensland, the egg quota is tied to the farm. This is possibly a better system. In Western Australia, the maximum number of hens that can be held under a licence is 30,000. Although it was thought that that quota would be circumvented and that many small farms with 30,000 birds would be set up under different names, apparently that has not occurred. But even in Western Australia I understand that licences for hens have changed hands for $15 a bird. In Victoria I have heard mention of a figure of about $10 to $11 a bird. This is a matter of great concern to the industry. It might be a nice way to get out of the industry but it is centring the industry in fewer and fewer hands. It is capitalising a monopoly into the hands of a few people. Entry to the industry is effectively barred now unless the people concerned have quite a deal of funds in hand. There needs to be some sort of investigation as to what extent and how much we need this son of permanent bureaucracy imposed on the egg industry. It appears that the industry cannot operate on a margin of much less than 12 per cent to 1 5 per cent of exports to guarantee that there will always be eggs supplied on the domestic market, apart from that qualification I added that sometimes inevitably it will not be possible to buy 60 gram-a-dozen eggs. We have the CEMAA scheme which is administered by the State egg boards. We also have the Australian Egg Board and some administrative mechanisms for collecting this money. I suppose that the State boards provide that administration. We are building on top of this administrative system which is imposed on the industry in which there are fewer and fewer producers. In addition, we are building in this system of quotas and licences as a result of CEMAA and capitalising and in many ways imposing distortions on the industry. The New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, Mr Day, has said that he will do something to stop this. Indeed, his Government acted with respect to the dairying industry in which milk quotas were being sold for higher and higher amounts. In my area, many producers objected rather strongly about that because there was no compensation for the capitalisation that had taken place. People felt that they had been robbed, particularly people who had bought a dairy quota and suddenly found that it was valueless. If Mr Day can do something about the problem in the egg industry, he will have our respect because it is a very difficult problem. As the egg industry does not receive any direct subsidisation or direct assistance from the Commonwealth Government, except for the money put into the research grants, it would seem that it is not an industry whose problems can be readily referred to the Industries Assistance Commission. But it is an industry that requires more investigation particularly of what I have described as bureaucratic encumbrance and the amount of money that is being built up in the licences imposed on the industry."
"N/A","Consideration resumed from 21 February, on motion by Mr Sinclair:"
"JVS","A few days ago an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, Mr Jim Kaldis, claimed that the Government's immigration policy was discriminatory and in particular that it discriminated against people coming to Australia from Greece. Mr Kaldis took the figures for the last financial year, as published in the report of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and claimed that these figures showed that the new points system that has operated from 1 January was discriminatory. The first point I want to make is that obviously Mr Kaldis was either incompetent or dishonest in taking the figures for the last financial year and claiming that they proved that a system introduced on 1 January of this year was discriminatory. Regrettably the newspapers in Sydney gave this some prominence without realising that obviously his figures could not support his argument. Mr Kaldis is a new member of the New South Wales Legislative Council and I would hope that he does not degenerate to the same level as some of his Labor colleagues who exercise deceit, deception and distortion in their public statements and who attempt to mislead the Australian public. I hope he improves his performance. The facts are these: The Numerical Multifactor Assessment System which started on 1 January has hardly had a real chance to be assessed. The first migrant to come to Australia under this system has been chosen and he will arrive in the near future. He is a gentleman from Italy. The claims of , based on figures available for the last financial year, must be put in proper perspective. He talks about the difficulties experienced by persons from Greece. It is perfectly plain when one looks at the figures that there has been a particular family reunion rate applicable to Greece which is higher than that for many other areas. I point out that was complaining about family reunions. The fact is that 77 per cent of Greek migrants in the last year were approved on a family reunion basis compared to 31.6 per cent for Italian migrants, 15 per cent for South African migrants, 24 per cent for Rhodesian migrants and a higher level of 64 per cent for migrants from Turkey. He said that our policy discriminated particularly against people from Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries. But I point out that the two highest figures were 77 per cent for Greek migrants and 64 per cent for Turkish migrants. Over the past seven months, to the end of January 1979, the proportion of all applications from South Africa which have been approved was 54 per cent; 51 per cent of applications from Greece were approved. So there is not much difference there. The rate for Italy was 46 per cent, for Rhodesia 28 per cent, for Turkey 28 per cent, for the United Kingdom 40 per cent, for the United States 35 per cent and for France 13 per cent. It is very difficult to imagine how Mr Kaldis could claim that the figures that are available show a discrimination against Mediterranean and Middle Eastern people in favour of people from the United Kingdom or other places such as South Africa. The other point that he has left out is that the number of people applying to come to Australia from Greece has gone down significantly. There is not all that much that the Australian Government can do about that. One must bear in mind the fact that Greece has a population of about nine million and that the Greek Government itself has recently expressed concern about Greece's failure to increase its own population. There are only about 100 people per month applying to come here from Greece. They may have heard about some of our difficulties with the employment situation here. Nonetheless only about 100 per month apply to come here. I would be delighted if more Greek people liked to come. There are many Greek persons in the St George electorate and the more Greek migrants who come here under the points system the better- and that includes family reunions. I point out that members of Parliament on both sides of the House and in other States should not mislead the public, should use the figures properly and should give NUMAS a chance to run until we can assess properly how it is working."
"CH4","asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 22 August 1978: (1) How many contracts entered into by Departments and Statutory Corporations under his control for the purchase of equipment, contained clauses specifying an offset arrangement with the vendor for the purchase of Australian manufactured goods, components and/or technology during the last 10 years. (2) What were those contracts. (3) What was the sum involved in each offset clause and what were the terms of its discharge. (4) What is the extent to which the terms of these clauses have been implemented specifying in each case the monetary value of the implementation. (5) What sum is currently available under these clauses for the purchase of relevant Australian manufactured goods, components and/or technology."
"HI4","asked the Minister for Finance, on notice, on 21 November 1978: (1) Under what circumstances are his (a) departmental staff and (b) ministerial staff authorised to travel on Concorde aircraft between the United States and the United Kingdom. (2) What is the additional cost per journey. (3) How many officers of his Department (a) sought approval, (b) were granted approval and (c) were refused approval to travel on Concorde aircraft during (i) 1976-77, (ii) 1977-78, (iii) 1978-79 to date. (4) How many officers from his Department or personal staff have travelled on Concorde aircraft without seeking approval."
"ZJ4","asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 21 November 1978: (1) Is the National Income Forecast report which was quoted by him during Question Time on 28 September 1978 (Hansard, page 1491) a report based on forecasts made by a Treasury or a Reserve Bank macroeconomic model. (2) If so, what assumptions were used in making the estimates quoted by him. (3) What rates of—(a) economic growth; (b) consumption, and; (c) investment growth were predicted by the model. (4) What were the reasons for the inaccuracy of the unemployment forecasts."
"QS4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The forecasting models developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Treasury, and by the Reserve Bank of Australia, are used as one input in the preparation of forecasts such as those contained in National Income Forecasting Committee reports. Such forecasts also rely on assumptions and analyses provided by various area specialists. (2) and (3) In keeping with previous practice neither the detailed forecasts nor the detailed assumptions underlying them will be provided. However with regard to forecasts of economic growth, consumption and investment, the Government provides information on the economic outlook in the Budget Speech and Statement No. 2 attached thereto. Material from the forecasting models is one part of the input to such forecasts. (4) Small variations in either the participation rate or growth of total employment can lead to significant changes in the level of unemployment. Thus forecasts of unemployment are inevitably subject to a considerable margin of error- particularly under conditions such as those operating in the economy over the past few years."
"2e+04","asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 27 February 1979: (1) What sum was paid by the private health funds under items 6469 and 274-275 since the introduction of these items or for any period for which the information is available. (2) With the cost sharing of hospitals arrangement what is the sum paid by the Commonwealth and the States under items 6469 and 274-275 since the introduction of these items or for any period for which the information is available."
"GH4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) For the year ended 30 June 1978, it is estimated that private health funds other than Medibank Private paid approximately $1.4m in medical benefits under these items. During the same period, Medibank paid approximately $2m but the split of this figure between Medibank Standard and Medibank Private is not available. (2) This information is not available. Under the terms of the hospital cost sharing agreements, the net operating costs of recognised (public) hospitals are shared by the Commonwealth and each State Government. The cost of treatment for specific medical treatments is not available."
"2e+04","asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 27 February 1979: (1) Will he explain why items 274-275 introduced in 1976 and item 6469 introduced in 1974 were put on the Medical Benefits Schedule when existing items appeared to cover these. (2) Were they introduced as a result of the Menhennitt and Levine rulings in 1969 and 1971 respectively."
"GH4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Items 274-275 covering induction and management of second trimester labour were introduced into the Medical Benefits Schedule from 1 October 1976 on the recommendation of the Medical Benefits Schedule Revision Committee. The Schedule Revision Committee had accepted the need for the specific item as suggested by the Federal AMA Co-ordinating Committee of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Item 6469 covering evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage was introduced into the Schedule from 22 April 1974 as part of the recommendations of the Medical Fees Tribunal 1973 which was under the chairmanship of Mr Justice J. T. Ludeke. This item formed part of the Australian Medical Association's submission to the Tribunal and was included in the Association's List of Medical Services and Fees 1973. (2) Neither the Schedule Revision Committee nor the Medical Fees Tribunal had any regard to these rulings."
