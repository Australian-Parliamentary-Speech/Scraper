"249710","On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, Report 225: Australia-UAE CEPA; Australia-UAE investment agreement. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e). by leave—I'm pleased to make a statement on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report, Report 225: Australia-UAE CEPA; Australia-UAE investment agreement. The major treaty actions considered in this report are the comprehensive economic partnership agreement between Australia and the United Arab Emirates and the agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Australia on the promotion and protection of investments. The promotion and protection of investments agreement is an integral part of the economic partnership. Whilst the agreements were discussed separately in this report, they were considered together throughout this inquiry. This report also contains three minor treaty actions for which an inquiry was not conducted. The major treaties seek to diversify Australian trade with the UAE on over 99 per cent of exported goods—I'll repeat that, 99 per cent of exported goods. It provides for an expanding Australia-UAE investment in sectors such as renewable energy, agribusiness, tourism, health and aged care, and resources. It also provides investors with greatened certainty of access. The CEPA is Australia's first free trade agreement with the Middle East, and it sets to increase Australian exports by around $678 million per year. In addition to tariff removal, the two treaties provide scope for expanding Australia's UAE investment in sectors such as renewable energy, agribusiness, tourism, health and aged care, and resources. Once fully implemented, it is estimated that the agreements will increase Australian export by approximately $678 million per year. These agreements include standalone chapters that encourage environmental sustainability, women's economic empowerment, labour rights and improved animal welfare standards. These agreements are trying something new. In a first for Australia, these agreements also include standalone tractors that encourage sustainable agriculture and food systems, and trade and investment, and economic cooperation with First Nations people. In considering these agreements, the committee held two public hearings and received a combination of 24 submissions. A range of witnesses were consulted throughout the hearings including agriculture, farming and livestock industry representatives, representatives from unions, fair trade investment industry representatives and government agencies. The committee heard that these agreements will boost trade and investment between Australia and the UAE, which is great news for Australian farmers, primary producers and associated businesses. It will make goods and services from Australia cheaper for the UAE, making us more competitive on the global market and making Australia more attractive to UAE traders and investors. Throughout the hearing, some issues were raised and discussed. The importance of ongoing and transparent communication throughout the consultation process has been acknowledged by the committee, as have the concerns around labour rights and human rights in the UAE. The committee noted that the UAE is undertaking a process of reform in their practices around labour rights and human rights, and believes these agreements will encourage ongoing productive dialogue on these matters. Some unions and NGOs have expressed concern about the UAE's labour laws; however, it is evident that the promotion of labour protections was a priority in the trade negotiations between the Australian government and the UAE. The UAE has agreed for the first time for a dedicated chapter covering trade and labour. This chapter establishes a dialogue to advance labour rights; promotes compliance with international labour organisation standards and enforcement of labour laws; affirms a commitment to address forced labour, including in the supply chain; supports workforce development and respect for labour rights in the digital economy; promotes public awareness of labour laws; provides procedural guarantees; and enhances cooperation on labour matters of mutual respect. The agreements also include standalone chapters on women's economic empowerment. The UAE CEPA does not include an investor state dispute mechanism, labour market testing waiver or changes to the Foreign Investment Review Board. The committee supports both major treaties and recommends that a binding treaty be taken. The committee also supports the three minor treaty actions that have been included in this report. I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in this inquiry for their time, honesty and participation. Thank you for your valuable evidence. I would also like to thank the secretariat for working to get this done over the summer break. On behalf of the committee, I recommend the report to the House.","17"
"261393","I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following from occurring immediately: (1) the Member for Calare introducing the Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill; and (2) debate on the second reading of the bill proceeding for a period of no longer than one hour, after which any questions required to complete passage of the bill then being put without delay. Since I introduced the Keeping Cash Transactions Bill to this House, I have been overwhelmed with the response not only from around the electorate of Calare but also from around our nation. The response has been so positive and so forceful because people are worried that cash is going to be phased out. This groundbreaking legislation preserves the use of cash in our national economy. It does this by legislating that businesses operating in face-to-face settings must offer to accept and, crucially, must accept cash payments for transactions that do not exceed $10,000. The bill provides for maximum civil penalties of $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for companies—and it should be noted that they are civil penalties as opposed to criminal penalties. The bill also provides some important and practical exemptions to these requirements. They include that offering to accept cash would pose a reasonable security risk; that it would be contrary to another law of the Commonwealth or a law of a state or territory; that it would be contrary to the Commonwealth, state or territory health advice such as advice provided during a pandemic; and that cash in the form of change is needed but not readily available. It defies belief that cash can be legal tender in this country but businesses are not obliged to accept cash for transactions. All they have to do is make it known to a customer that cash is not accepted and they don't have to accept it. This is causing a huge amount of anxiety and grief in our communities, particularly our country communities. Many senior Australians do not want to use cards for their transactions. The Reserve Bank of Australia has found that Australians over the age of 65 are the heaviest users of cash. To many older Australians, cash is not just a convenience; it's a lifeline. In these times of economic uncertainty and rising costs, cash is actually an essential tool for managing finances and sticking to a budget. Many Australians find managing accounts and cards online to be a very stressful experience, and they find it confusing. Many Australians, particularly older Australians, don't want to use online banking or online accounts. I should point out, coming from a rural and regional area, that cash is often used in rural areas by individuals who don't have ready access to banking services. Many constituents in the Calare electorate are also worried that, if they are forced to switch to cards, they will face additional fees in the form of bank surcharges—and that is a very good point. Many Australians are now waking up to the fact that banks and financial institutions charge merchant fees for card transactions which can then be passed on to consumers. It's an insidious tax that is added to transactions just by tapping a card. It's been estimated that Australians are losing more than a billion dollars a year in surcharges when they pay by card and not by cash. I've had feedback from local businesses about my Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill. Many businesses actually want to keep cash as well; they don't want to switch to being solely digital. But, like many in our community, they are worried there may be an agenda either by governments or by large corporations to phase cash out. In country areas, we also need to consider the practicalities of internet connectivity. In many regional and rural areas reliable internet access does not exist, and cash remains a dependable means of exchange that does not rely on electricity or internet access. The bottom line is that cash transactions are unaffected by digital failures. During natural disasters like fires or floods, connectivity can be disrupted for many days—sometimes longer—rendering electronic payments unusable. As I've said, many Australians prefer cash as a means of managing their budget so they can physically see the money and it can be allocated to different expenses. I ask you: how can we teach our children about the value of money and budgeting if they don't actually know what it is? Other Australians worry about privacy and the risk of fraud associated with using cards. Many Australians have been victims of fraud and unauthorised transactions relating to cards and accounts linked to them. Privacy is another reason some Australians prefer to use cash over cards. And some people simply don't like or want corporations knowing every single thing they buy. It should be their choice, and they should have the right to use cash if they want to. This bill is not about imposing burdens and regulations on businesses; it's about striking a balance between innovation and inclusivity and preserving the essence of choice in our financial transactions and in our economy. It's about the freedom of Australians to choose how they will pay for their transactions. I note that the government has responded to my Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill by stating that there is a plan to make cash transactions compulsory for essential services. I accept the Treasurer and the member for Fenner have worked on this with the best will in the world, but unfortunately I don't think it is the approach that most in our communities would support. I think, speaking frankly, it's a second-best approach that acknowledges that the community wants action to keep cash, but I don't think it will be effective. I don't think it will stop businesses phasing out the use of cash. I don't think it will keep cash king in Australia. I think it will only end up applying to big businesses and, while it may force the supermarket giants and big fuel companies to keep cash, it won't go much further. I think Australians around our nation who still want to use cash for everyday transactions will be disappointed by the government's response to this issue. In country areas there are many people who don't buy their food and groceries from major supermarket chains, and they use cash to buy a whole range of goods and services which won't be caught by the government's so-called mandate. What the government is proposing simply is not strong enough. If the government is serious about keeping cash in Australia, it should be backing my bill. That's why this bill needs to be discussed and debated in this House and passed as a matter of urgency. Australians should have the confidence to carry cash in their wallets knowing that they can use their legal tender to make a purchase anywhere at any time As I've said, there are many people in our community who are crying out for action on this, and they haven't received it from this parliament. That's what my bill remedies. I would urge all members to support this bill. I think that this bill is vital to protect the right of Australians to choose how they will pay for their transactions. That's not a choice that should be made for them by financial institutions or businesses. So I commend this motion to the House and I urge Australians all over our great nation to get behind this bill and lobby their members of parliament to support this bill to preserve the use of cash in our society and in our economy. Many Australians are feeling marginalised by the move to a digital economy, they feel that they are being left behind and they feel that their voices are not being heard. They want to keep cash king in Australia. So I would urge all members to back this motion and keep cash king in Australia.","17"
"N/A","Electricity Infrastructure Legislation Amendment Bill 2025","12"
"M3C","I move the amendment circulated in my name: (1) Page 3 (after line 24), at the end of the Bill, add: Schedule 2 — Capacity Investment Scheme Program Climate Change Act 2022 1 After Part 4 Add: Part 4A — Capacity Investment Scheme 15B Simplified outline of this Part The Capacity Investment Scheme Program must be implemented to achieve at least 23 gigawatts of renewable generation capacity and at least 9 gigawatts of clean dispatchable capacity. 15C Administration of the Capacity Investment Scheme Program If, at the commencement of this subsection, the Capacity Investment Scheme Program is prescribed by legislative instrument under subsection 33(1) of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986, then: the Commonwealth must make, vary or administer arrangements in relation to the carrying out of activities by one or more persons under the Capacity Investment Scheme Program; and those arrangements must result in, by the end of 2030: at least 23 gigawatts of renewable generation capacity; and at least 9 gigawatts of clean dispatchable capacity. Note: The arrangements referred to in this subsection may include arrangements made, varied or administered before the commencement of this subsection. If advice of the Climate Change Authority under subsection 14 (1) indicates a material risk to the achievement of subsection (1), the Minister's Annual Climate Change Statement under section 12 must provide a response to that advice. 15D Amendment of the Capacity Investment Scheme Program (1) An instrument made under subsection 33(1) of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 (the amending instrument), that varies or revokes another instrument made under that subsection that prescribes the Capacity Investment Scheme Program, does not come into effect until the amending instrument has been approved by a resolution of each House of the Parliament. (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not apply to an instrument made under subsection 33(1) of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 that varies or revokes another instrument made under that subsection if that other instrument does not prescribe the Capacity Investment Scheme Program. One thing we know for sure is that the Liberals will stop at nothing to attack renewables. We have seen this in the past, where they used every opportunity to try and get rid of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency as well as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Those two agencies have driven huge investment in renewables in this country and given great confidence to the renewables industry, which we know we need to grow if we're to get out of coal and gas—which the scientists are telling us we must do if we are to have any chance of tackling the climate crisis. We also know that the Leader of the Opposition's dangerous nuclear fantasy is a ploy to extend the life of coal and gas in the system and threaten investment in renewables. We've even heard the Leader of the Opposition say so himself—that, under his dangerous fantasy of a plan, coal and gas will have to stay in the system for longer. In many respects, that is what his agenda is all about. We know that the opposition's energy policies have been written by the coal and gas industries because they know now that renewables are not only the best way of cutting emissions but are the cheapest form of electricity.","17"
"N/A","Early Childhood Education and Care (Three Day Guarantee) Bill 2025","12"
"HWP","It was interesting to listen to the government now saying that the Early Childhood Education and Care (Three Day Guarantee) Bill 2025 will actually support every child in Australia. They're going to get the best start possible—it's supposed to be a Labor guarantee—but that's, of course, except for rural and regional families, where there actually is no child care available today and won't be in the future. This will guarantee 72 hours a fortnight of taxpayer subsidised child care but certainly not if you're in a childcare desert, where there is no child care available at all. It's supposed to be three days for all families. Well, it won't guarantee that for those families in rural, regional and more remote areas, where there's actually no child care at all. What this bill does not guarantee is that it will actually prioritise places and access for working families or single parents over non-working families. What will a single mum who has to work to keep her children do, especially during a cost-of-living crisis? What does she do if she cannot access child care at all? How does the government think she will feel when she looks in the door at the childcare centre and sees children from families where the parent or parents are not working or not having to work because they are earning up to $533,000, which this bill actually allows subsidised child care for? What are her options? Not only is this unfair; it is divisive in communities. Removing priority access for working families is a terrible decision by Labor. I can only imagine how this will pit family against family where there are and where there will be no childcare places available for the families who need it most. This is divisive, not only for family against family but for metro verses rural, regional and remote. Where is the child care for those in our regional and rural areas that don't have access to any child care at all? How can this be for each and every child in Australia when there's no child care available in our communities? That's how out of touch that side is. I look at the divisive nature of this. For the ones for whom there is no childcare centre or places available because there's no child care or no workers and no accommodation, especially in our smaller regional towns and communities, this bill does absolutely nothing. Why not? I don't know why not. Why does this Labor government continue to ignore regional communities that don't have any child care available at all? And what do these families do right now in the midst of Labor's cost-of-living crisis, where both parents have to work probably more than one job because the interest on their mortgage has gone up by thousands of dollars? The cost of their energy, their fuel, their food and their insurance has gone through the roof under this government. Many of these people don't have family living close by who can babysit for them. When you live in a regional and remote community—or you're a farmer, and you've got to get on a tractor because it's hay season—what do you do if there's no child care? That's what's happening in our communities. There are so many childcare deserts in Australia where there is no child care available at all. This bill does nothing for them, and it's a false claim to say that every child in Australia will benefit from it. What do you do where there is no child care available? What are they supposed to do when they haven't got family living close by? And why do they have to continue begging for the government to act on their behalf—to actually look at the childcare needs in their small communities? Keep in mind that these people, who don't have access to child care, work in the regions where Australia's wealth comes from—in the mining and ag sector, often in remote locations. What good is a three-day guarantee for families living in a regional and remote area where there are no childcare centres or services available? What do you do? It's obvious that Labor is only interested in supporting inner-city and metro areas, because they've completely ignored this fact. Come and live in regional, rural and remote Australia, and see how you go with a three-day guarantee when there is no childcare centre or facility available, and you've got no family, and you have to work because you can't make ends meet. It also does nothing for parents who need flexibility, for the families on shiftwork or for those needing out-of-hours child care. Only Labor would think that taxpayers on a modest income of just over $45,000, who are paying 30c on the dollar in tax, should be subsidising child care for families earning up to $533,000. How on earth is that fair? I've got a prime example of a childcare desert that's been in my electorate. For several years, I've been working with a wonderful but desperate group of women in the small town of Augusta in my electorate. They've been working their hearts out constantly to provide Augusta parents, families and small businesses with access to child care. They know how important this is. Prior to their efforts, there was no child care available at all in Augusta. How good is this 'every child in Australia' promise when it ignores this fact? There was no child care without these women getting busy, and this group of amazing. persistent women have never given up. Recently, they finally secured some funding to renovate a building and, with the previous federal approvals, have successfully run a vacation program for three years now. Unfortunately, they were not successful in their application to the current government for a Community Child Care Fund grant in 2024. They were classified as inner regional, when they're well over 300 kilometres from Perth, 3½ hours away. They've told me there are many regional areas in the same predicament regarding lack of child care and resourcing, because others are getting in touch, saying, 'We've got no child care—we can't work, we can't support our local businesses and we can't support our families.' But, in spite of their setbacks, they're hoping to open their early childhood project in mid- to late 2025. Good on them. After all these years and all this work, they cannot wait to see the impact that a childcare centre has on their small town of Augusta and its littlest residents. They've said they're hoping to inspire other country towns to keep speaking up. I'm speaking up in here for those country towns that don't have child care. So don't come in here and say that every child in Australia is going to benefit from this, okay? They are really focused and hoping to inspire other country towns to keep speaking up regarding the importance of child care for their towns to thrive. They have also said, 'We hope that, in the years to come, childcare deserts are a thing of the past.' They won't be, with this bill. There's nothing in it for these small communities. They said, 'Rural children and families deserve equal access to early learning, regardless of their postcode.' What help is this bill to them? These are the words of Kylie Lucas, the Augusta & Districts Community Childcare Inc. Treasurer. She's the local pharmacist, and she's been desperate for child care in Augusta. That's what she's been saying. It should not be this hard or take this long and take so much effort for rural and regional families to have access to what people in metro areas often take for granted. Why are the people, the families, the small businesses that desperately need these workers in these areas and the families that are doing it tough less important and less valued and not covered under this legislation? It's an absolute disgrace. It should have been a priority for the Labor government. Why doesn't the Labor government fix the childcare deserts before offering subsidised child care to families earning $533,000? What a disgraceful slap in the face for those of us who live in the regions. Equally, how fair is it that Labor are subsidising child care for families earning up to $533,000 while at the same time capping access to independent youth allowance at a parental income of $160,000? How fair is that? Once again, this affects students and families in regional and remote parts of Australia—the areas Labor clearly does not care about. These are the young people in our electorates who often have no choice but to leave their homes to go to university, because the courses they need to study—in our case, in Western Australia—are available only in the city. These are courses such as medicine, law, pharmacy and engineering. But Labor applies the $160,000 threshold for access to independent youth allowance while at the same time providing taxpayer subsidised child care for families earning $533,000. In every instance it is regional and rural and remote families and children and the small businesses that are desperate for these workers and these professionals who are missing out under this government. It should not be forgotten that since Labor came to government the cost of child care—for those who can get it—has increased by 22.3 per cent. Since Labor's cheaper child care policy came into effect, actual out-of-pocket costs have increased by 12.7 per cent, and one in three services are charging above this fee cap. Childcare providers have also been hit by increased operational costs and increased regulations. Labor has estimated that more than 100,000 families will have access to more subsidised care and more than 66,000 families will better off. Well, that is not every child in Australia, as we keep hearing about here. It represents only about six per cent of all families currently engaged with the childcare subsidy system. What happens to the rest? And where will the extra staff need to come from? Even with this commitment, we are so short of childcare staff. Once again, I want to reiterate that if the government thinks that every family in Australia that needs child care currently has access to child care then the government is certainly out of touch with rural and regional Australia. The number of childcare deserts that exist, where there is absolutely no child care—I wonder whether the government has that list and whether they've actually looked at it, and looked at the numbers of small communities in rural and regional areas that have no access to child care. Why wasn't that part of the consideration in this bill, if we're talking about every child in Australia? That's what we just heard: every child in Australia—except if you live in a childcare desert, where there is absolutely no child care. What do they do, and what does this bill do for them?","17"

"300121","Now we see some animation in the parliament. Good! Why is it that, time and again in this parliament, the lowest income people in this society, the people who are often the most downtrodden, are told to wait time and again. The government has proposed a 20 per cent reduction in student debt but said we have to wait until after the next election. We know the impact of this activity test disproportionately affects not only low-income people but also First Nations people. One of the other really good things about this bill is that it ensures that First Nations children will be eligible for 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight. Great! We've just had a Closing the gap report that demonstrates the huge gaps in educational outcomes between First Nations children and other children in this country. So why not accelerate this bill? To be clear, this is not directed at some of the Labor members in this House, because I know that it was not your decision. But it is deeply frustrating when we have gone privately and publicly to the government and said: 'We will pass this bill unamended as quickly as possible. We will secure its passage through the House and Senate using any means necessary to make this bill law before the election.' That's what we've said. And yet we have seen this government turn around and do a dirty deal with the Liberals on electoral reform instead. The effect of one of the other bills that's being gagged and shoved through right now in the Senate will be cutting the access to and amount of DSP, or disability support pension, of young people aged 18 to 21. That's apparently a priority, but actually helping people in this country to get access to child care is not. To give the human impact of the decision to delay this bill, I'll quote from the ABC: Megan Hunt loves being a mum to her two and four-year-old boys but there's been a sting as she's tried to navigate what she feels is best for her children. Ms Hunt, a nurse, didn't want to return to work immediately after maternity leave and decided to stay home with her sons until they were three. 'Parenting young kids is really full on, it's really intense, it requires pretty much everything you've got—emotionally, physically, financially—which I know I would not trade for the world but any parent will tell you they need a bit of flexibility and you do need support,' … Before her children were born she worked casually as a nurse and picking up work in the in-demand profession wouldn't be a problem. That's what she thought. When her eldest son turned three, she hoped to return to casual part-time work while her son attended pre-school. But the uncertainty around her hours as a casual employee made it impossible to secure the childcare subsidy (CCS) and the doors to childcare were closed This had devastating impacts on her career. There are a lot of women in particular around the country whose lives could be improved right now if we accelerated the passage of the bill. It genuinely beggars belief. In what is potentially the last week of this parliament before an election where we do not know the outcome, we could accelerate this. Instead, the government has prioritised a stitch-up on electoral laws that will see their party get more public money from taxpayers and a bill that cuts the DSP for young people aged 18 to 21. It would be great if we heard someone from the government explain why electoral law reform that won't even be enacted this year—that is a stitch-up for the major parties—is a higher priority than helping people like Megan get access to early childhood education. And you wonder why people are fed up with politics. Their lives are tough right now. They are doing it tough right now, and our childcare system is in crisis. There is a bill before this parliament right now that could help them. Are we seriously going to suggest that we're going to get through this entire week and not do our jobs to get this bill through as quickly as possible? It's genuinely shocking. Of course, the Greens have a much more expansive childcare policy. We think it should be completely universal and free for everyone because we think that access to early childhood education is just as important as access to primary and secondary school. You wouldn't countenance charging, sometimes, thousands of dollars of fees to prohibit people from accessing primary or secondary school, so why would you do it for early childhood education? Notwithstanding the fact that often when you're trying to get the subsidies under these schemes it's deeply complex, and it almost feels like you need a master's degree to get through it—notwithstanding all of that and our much more expansive policy—we have put that aside and said that we will not demand one single amendment in return for the passage of this bill. We will pass it unamended. I hope that there are ministers and people in charge of the Labor Party watching this right now and understanding that this is our message to the Labor Party here. We will pass it. The choice that the Labor Party has is to take that olive branch and use it to get it through the House and Senate as quickly as possible. Drop the overprioritisation of stitch-ups on electoral reforms. Drop the overprioritisation of cutting the disability support pension for 18- to 21-year-olds to effectively close the loophole. Instead, let's prioritise getting women, children and parents access to good-quality early childhood education, and get rid of a draconian Morrison-era law that effectively cruelled people's access to early childhood education. Indeed, one of the things that Megan said in this article is: The activity test is really tied up in what the parents are doing, when the question should really be, 'would this benefit kids?' Because then it really doesn't matter what the parents are doing. I would argue that the question, 'Does this benefit kids?' applies to everyone in this place, in the Senate and in the Labor Party as well. If they genuinely believe that this bill is important—and certainly the Greens do—then they will roll up and they will accelerate the passage of the bill through the House and through the Senate. It's an easy test that the government can pass because what I'm about to propose is that we vote on this right now. I move: That the question be now put.","17"
"300126","I rise to acknowledge eight outstanding Australians from my electorate of Robertson who have this year received 2025 Australia Day honours. The Australian honours and awards system recognises the outstanding service and contributions of Australians. Recipients come from right across the country and from all walks of life. While some are well known, the majority are unsung heroes. While typically they haven't sought thanks or recognition, they deserve both. The honours and awards system gives Australians a chance to celebrate and acknowledge those who work tirelessly to improve local communities and to make Australia a better place, and I would like to take this opportunity to recognise each of these eight recipients who have dedicated themselves consistently and tirelessly in their respective fields. The Robertson 2025 Australia Day honours recipients include Mr Matthew Formston AM of Wamberal, who has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to people with a disability and to para sports. Matt Formston is no ordinary athlete. With less than three per cent vision, he is a world champion surfer, an Australian Paralympian, cyclist, author, executive coach and international keynote speaker. Matt's extraordinary journey includes surfing giant waves as a blind athlete, documented in the feature documentary The Blind Sea, and running clinics for visually impaired children to embrace the ocean's freedom. His impact extends to launching the award-winning children's book Surfing in the Dark and winning prestigious surfing awards, including a Guinness World Record for the largest wave. Matt is a relentless force, breaking barriers and inspiring people worldwide. The next recipient is Professor Julie Redfern AM of Terrigal, who has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to cardiology, allied health, research and education, and the community. Julie Redfern AM is a professor of public health and the 2022 New South Wales Woman of Excellence. Julie is also a physiotherapist, director of the Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare at Bond University, a member of the board of the World Heart Federation and a member of the Cardiac Society of Australia the New Zealand Scientific Committee. The next recipient is Emeritus Professor Joe Wolfe AM of Point Frederick, who was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to tertiary education and to music. Professor Joe Wolfe is a physicist, composer and professor at the University of New South Wales. He has worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University, at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO, and the Australian National University. As well as his research, Joe composes music for symphony orchestras and chamber ensembles. Mr Michael Buettner OAM of Terrigal has received the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the community and to sport. Michael is an Australian Rugby League official and was a professional footballer in the 1990s and 2000s. An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative back, he has played club football for the North Sydney Bears, the Northern Eagles, the Parramatta Eels and Wests Tigers. The late Mr Frank Davis OAM of Kincumber South has posthumously received a Medal of the Order of Australia for service to veterans and their families. There is also Dr Karen Douglas OAM of Avoca Beach, who has received a Medal of the Order of Australia for service to medicine as a general practitioner and to the community. Karen has worked as a GP and a practice owner of the Terrigal and Avoca Beach medical centres since 1990 and is a strong advocate for patients and their families, GPs, and other health professionals. There is also Mrs Amanda Noffs OAM of MacMasters Beach, who has received a Medal of the Order of Australia for service to youth through health services. Amanda Noffs is involved with Life Education Australia and the Ted Noffs Foundation. She helped to establish Australia's first drug treatment program for adolescents, in partnership with the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre. Finally, there is Ms Ellen Davies ASM of Green Point, who has received an Ambulance Service Medal, which recognises distinguished service as a member of an Australian ambulance service. I say again: huge congratulations to each of our Robertson 2025 Australia Day honours recipients. Thank you for all of the work that you do in our communities and for making the Central Coast and, indeed, the nation a better place for all.","17"
