"KFS","Germany is now frankly mobilized on the grand scale for the overrunning and acquisition of any near country which excites its cupidity. Mr.Curtin. - I imagine that Mr. Chamberlain will not thank the Minister for this speech. The Leader of the Opposition will have an opportunity to make his comments in due course. I invite the honorable gentleman to study the speech made by Mr. Chamberlain at Birmingham quite recently. The objective of Germany is no longer a professed and almost religious impulse to attach to the Reich Germans, who, as Hitler has so often declared, were dwelling in an agony of mind, and suffering discriminating treatment under an alien government. The objective has become purely material, and conquest is openly planned for the glorification of Germany and the gain of currency reserves, productive soil, oil wells, or anything else which in Hitler's mind is necessary or desirable to the Fatherland. So Austria was overrun without the firing of a shot."

"JWE","On the 4th May, the honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Curtin) asked the following questions, upon notice: - What contracts have been let to private firms for the manufacture of arms and munitions, during the present programme? To whom have they been let? What is the value of each contract? I am now in a position to inform the honorable member that, since the 1st March, 1938, the following contracts have been placed with private firms for the manufacture of munition components: -"
"JWT","s asked the Minister for Supply and Development, upon notice - Has any staff been engaged for the projected manufacture of British bombers in Australia? Have any contracts for the manufacture of small components been let? Have any plans been drawn up for the erection of assembly plants? Have jigs, tools and fixtures been shipped from England? Were they procured by the British Air Ministry and prepared for shipment so as to avoid delay? Would a delay of even a month be important if war broke out?"
"JWE","The scheme for the manufacture of air frames will centre on two central shops, one to be erected at Melbourne and one at Sydney, where the main parts of the air frames will be brought together for final assembly and fitting of engines and instruments. The central erection shops will be fed by four main assembly units, comprising the railways workshops in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. The railways workshops units will sub-contract out to existing factories in civil industry the production of parts and components for the air frames. A technical representative of the Bristol Aircraft Company is, at present, in Australia. Another has left the United Kingdom, and a third expert is to leave England at an early date. The necessity for the engagement of local staff directly by the Commonwealth will not arise until the erection stage is being approached. As the railways workshops mentioned and their sub-contractors will be the suppliers of the main assembly units, the question of engagement of staff will be one for the railways and the respective subcontractors should additional staff be necessary. The scheme, however, envisages the utilising of existing capacity to the fullest extent. Contracts have not yet been placed for components and although detailed plans of the central erection shops have not been completed general requirements have been determined. Arrangements have been completed with the British Air Ministry for the jigs, tools and fixtures and also such materials as it is necessary to import to be made available as required, but shipment has not yet been made. It is important that the scheme should be pushed ahead as rapidly as possible, but the honorable member will appreciate that in a long-range plan providing for deliveries to be made over three years commencing in 1940 and involving several millions of pounds, it is necessary for detailed arrangements to be carefully prepared in the first instance so that the launching of the scheme will be on a sound basis. It is far better to take a little time in the initial stages to ensure this, than to proceed hastily with an illprepared scheme which would probably mean that the ultimate result would be much less satisfactory than would be the case if the scheme were initially prepared on a sound and satisfactory basis. The honorable member may be assured that this matter is receiving the urgent attention of the Government and will be prosecuted to the greatest extent possible consistent with sound basic arrangements and the formulation of satisfactory plans.

If so, where will the evidence be taken? When does the committee leave Australia tor New Guinea? What will be its itinerary and in what order will centres be visited to secure evidence? Is the long deferred question of the selection of the capital site in New Guinea to await the completion of the committee's present labours? If the amalgamation is decided upon, will the selection of a capital site be a matter for further inquiry by this committee, in view of the then altered circumstances? What approximate length of time will be taken by the committee in its present inquiry?"
"KXY","The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follows : - The committee which is to inquire into the question of the possibilities of the amalgamation of the Administrations of the Territories of Papua and New Guinea has already taken evidence in Canberra and will take further evidence in Sydney on the 11th and 12th May, 1939. The committee will proceed to the territories by the m.v. Macdhui, leaving Sydney on the 13th May, 1939. The committee proposes to proceed via Port Moresby and Samarai to Rubaul, and to visit centres in New. Guinea in the following order: - Kavieng, Salamaua, Lae, Madang, Finschhafen, Pondo, Rabaul, and Wau, and thence to Port Moresby, Samarai and Misima and Yule Island in Papua. Other places will be visited if considered necessary by the committee after its arrival in the territory. Until the completion of the committee's investigations, it is not proposed that a separate site should be selected for the administrative head-quarters of the Territory of New Guinea. The committee has been asked to investigate the possibility of a combined administration for the territories with one chief administrative centre. In the event of a recommendation being made by the committee thatno change be made in existing arrangements under which each territory has its separate administration, the committee has been asked to furnish its views upon the question of a site for the administrative head-quarters of New Guinea under a separate administration as now existing. It is estimated that the committee will complete its inquiries and report within three months."

"KEM","The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follows .' - 1 and 2. The decision to investigate what is involved in the provision of a' suitable and permanent flying boat base in Botany Bay has not been abandoned, but extreme pressure of other urgent work has prevented commencement of such investigation. It is known that this work would involve a very large expenditure which cannot be contemplated at the present time. The permanency of the flying boat base at Rose Bay will have to be considered in the light of any decision that may be reached concerning Botany Bay. It can bc anticipated that there will be developments in the empire air service in the next ten years. I have no reason to believe that Rose Bay cannot be developed to cope with any increase that may occur in the flying boat traffic."
