"F4U","I know what I am talking about. The members of that mysterious body are chosen by means known only to honorable members opposite, and it is significant that Sir Sydney Snow was seen within the precincts of this Parliament whenever any important legislation was being passed through this Parliament during the term of office of the previous Government. Honorable members should contrast the mysteriously appointed consultative council of the United Australia party with the democratically controlled Labour conferences, which give a fair cross-section of the views of the working people of Australia. The consultative council in its composition is the very antithesis of the Labour conferences. This bill authorizes the utilization of the services of members of the Citizen Military Forces in the South-western Pacific Zone, as outlined by the Prime Minister in the light of the following considerations : - The strategical set-up in the South-west Pacific Area; the objectives of global strategy in their particular relation to the South-west Pacific Area; the nature of the forces required for operations in the Pacific areas; the strength of the Australian naval, land and air forces available for commitments and for co-operation, not only in the South-west Pacific Area, but in other theatres as well; and Australia's manpower resources and the maximum forces they are capable of maintaining in the field, in tropical warfare. Another significant statement in the Prime Minister's speech must be borne in mind when determining whether the Government's proposals go far enough. The right honorable gentleman said -"
"KNX","The Navy was at the highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable exploits of some of its ships overseas. The home defence army was well trained, and its equipment had been greatly improved. The strength of the Air Force had been largely increased, both in respect of home defence squadrons and the training resources of the Empire Air Scheme. The equipment of the Air Force had also been much improved."
"KNX","On the Wednesd a y fixed upon, you will be expected to show that, under a strong provocation, willing a general holiday, you shall have it in the teeth of a lying press and a recreant Parliament. Not a cab, bus, tram or train should run, not a ship should sail, not a shop or factory or hotel or theatre should be open; not a newspaper should come out: not a butcher's, baker's or grocer's cart should be seen in the streets; not a man of the all- powerful working class should be at work. Will you, as a unionist, help in the success of this policy? It is a policy for the protection and preservation of trades unionism, with all that it implies in better wages and conditions through the glorious gospel and might of organization."
"KHL","Hear, hear!"
"DTN","I do not say that it is. The suggestion by the honorable member for New England that there had been some failure by us to meet the implied obligations of Australia as one of the leading nations engaged in the South-west Pacific Area cannot be supported. Every requisition for the movement of forces or material made upon this Government has been complied with. In the face of this no one should decry what Australia has done, is doing, and will do to achieve final victory. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there should be no question of party in this matter, but the Leader of the Opposition fails to answer the Prime Minister's case which is - That for a substantial period of time ahead the man-power resources of the country do not permit of the employment of the Militia to an extent greater than is suggested in the proposed boundary. That this boundary will not limit in any way the utilization of other Australian service units wherever they can best serve the Allied cause. The present strategic plan for the theatre of war in which Australia has a very special responsibility and interest suggests further concentration of our human and material resources within that area, with two objectives - preserving Australia against invasion, and carrying out Australia's part in any offensives that may from time to time be determined. The Government, especially the Minister for Defence, is the best judge of what the security of the country requires and permits. In. his considered opinion the present plan offers a practicable solution of a difficult and delicate problem. Its adoption does not prejudice future revision by Parliament of the plan. At the present I submit that the plan should be followed. There are two fundamental principles which are carried into effect by the bill - first, the present plan fulfils all the needs of General MacArthur's strategy not only for the present but also for a substantial period ahead of us. These needs are not measured in any niggardly way. The extended area is a vast one and those who measure it on Mercator's- projection will be grievously misled. Equally, it is wrong to hold out the chimera of an immediate conquest of the vast area which is embraced by the present proposal. Grandiose schemes not based on any realistic and practical or common sense assessment of the agreed strategy and our present resources, and the available allied resorces, will turn out to be a delusion and a snare, and may lead to utter disaster to a young nation, the war effort of which has been magnificent. In these matters what is practical and possible is also what is best. The present task set us is a great and noble one; let us unite to perform it."
"JY7","This much-heralded bill, which, I take it, has been the subject of countless conferences between the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) and others, with both the Central Branch of the Australian Labour party and, through it, with the State branches, is at last before the Parliament. One had been led to expect something which would be epoch-making; but this measure is what has been produced. The best way to prove the success or otherwise of the Government in producing this bill is to review the debate which has taken place here during the last two days. There has been a general chorus of criticism from this side of the chamber, whilst from the other side, apart from Ministers, only two private members have spoken. Both of them - I refer to the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) and the honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) - criticized the measure caustically, the former going so far as to say that he hoped to see it defeated. Apart from support from the ministerial bench, the bill has not received any approval whatsoever in this House. That is evidence of its poor quality, notwithstanding all the cogitation about it before its introduction. There is, in consequence, a feeling of unreality about the whole of the proceedings. If ever there was a time when proceedings in the world outside ought to be brought keenly to our notice, it is now, and therefore a bill which itself is unreal and which elicits very little interest either in this House or elsewhere is not adequate to meet the needs of the time. I desire to say a few words about zones, although I shall not go into details. The difficulty which members of this chamber have experienced has been to know what the South-western Pacific Zone really is. The honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) made a speech in this chamber early in December last, and I listened to it with keen interest because the honorable member indicated at least what the supposed zone was. Up till the n, one could only assume that the area, wherever it was situated, was south of the equator. The honorable member quoted from an American publication which has been described as the best-informed review of foreign affairs. After the last war, when I was in the United States of America, I was told that if I wished to read anything on foreign affairs, I should he welladvised to get the Christian Science Monitor. According to that publication, it appears that a zone is known in the United States of America as being the presumed zone of operations. I presume, the refore, that that zone is also known to the people of Great Britain. The remarks of the honorable member for Bourke on that occasion were censored, and do not appear in the records of the proceedings of this chamber. Yet the information which he gave to this House was available in the United States of America, and, as I have said, presumably in Great Britain also. I think that the honorable member's remarks were of such interest and importance that the y should be incorporated, as an addendum, in a later number of Hansard. Why should the people of Australia be deprived of information which is passed on to the m from this Parliament, when similar facts are known in. o the r countries? I admit the difficulty of applying a general censorship to different countries, but the honorable gentleman's remarks were censored on the ground of national safety, and that ground for the ir exclusion no longer can be advanced, seeing that similar information was published in the United States of America and Great Britain, the censored remarks should be reincorporated in Hansard. I shall not say much about the zone except to endorse what the right honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) said about General MacArthur's command. Why should our troops be confined to a specific command? Let me put a case to the House. I have listened with interest to the speeches which have been delivered here this week, but I have not heard much about our sister dominion of New Zealand. It is imaginable that New Zealand may be attacked, and not Australia. Should faha* happen, our Militia Forces could not, under this ball, be sent to New Zealand's aid, although members of the Australian Imperial Force could be sent the re. That would be deplorable. I always thought that the Labour party, as well .as of every o the r section of the , COntmunity, regarded New Zealand as a younger bro the r or sister, and that if a-ny one had a call upon us in an emergency it was the people of New Zealand. Shall we promote a better feeling between ourselves and o the r members of the British Commonwealth of Nations if we -make it impossible for our Militia Forces to assist a -sister dominion in an emergency? When the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) moved his amendment, I seconded it with great heartiness, and I am prepared to accept the responsibility for my action. The bill does not go far enough. If I may say so. St, is not so much a bill of expansion as of limitation. It will be so regarded by ' all foreign nations, -whether allies or foes. The measure before us is an intimation to our enemies that we shall not send troops any further than, has been prescribed, without first giving due notice to them. I am aware that there may be differences of opinion in these matters, but I do suggest to any open-minded man that it is better to have a general power which is likely to be wisely exercised, than a limited power which has constantly to be increased. I say, without the slightest fear of successful contradiction, that what Professor Dicey used to call ' the internal sanction ' applies here, and that no government will denude its own country of adequate defence. Risks may have to be taken; but we can presuppose that there will be no attempt to send such a large number of men overseas as would render this country liable to successful attack. There are two angles from which we can look at this matter. There is, first, the old Australian angle with which I hope to deal later; and, .secondly, the more important .angle at the present time, namely, the international aspect. Has any one who has sponsored this bill considered adequately the international reactions to it? What will be the opinion of the people of Great Britain, to whom we owe more than to any one else? What are likely to be that country's reactions to a bill like this, in view , 01 what its people have suffered in this war? In Great Britain, women as well as men have been conscripted, and the people have had to stand up to a war on their very doorsteps for a longer period than is customary in the case of men. in the firing line. Is the .exclusion of New Zealand likely to make us more 'beloved in the other dominions of the British 'Commonwealth? What about the United States of America, to whom we owe so much, whose people have come here so willingly, in such large numbers, -and which has acted with such an open hand? Is it not inevitable, if we want to do our fa ir share in this war, that we must give fully when it is our -own safety rather than the .safety of the United States of America which is primarily at stake? I have considered for years that -Canada is perhaps in the most privileged position in the world, with the Pacific and the AtlanticOceans on either side and .a very friendly United States of America to the south. We are not in a similar position. We have been surrounded for years by islands which may have concealed enemies. For a number of years I have addressed myself to this subject so' forcefully in speeches as to contract a sore throat. I have stressed the necessity for our realizing that Japan has a population of 70,000,000 cornpared with our 7,600,000; that it has had universal training of its manhood, and we have not. I asked what was likely to happen if a war occurred. That event has occurred. No one can deny that the two outstanding factors in those that have hitherto saved us have been the prodigious effort of the Motherland and the great assistance given to us most willingly ir the United States of America. Are not we to make an adequate return, .small in number though -we may be? The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) said this morning what I do not think one would have dreamt of his saying when he was a Justice of the High Court of Australia. Referring to conscription, he said that countries which have unlimited! manpower can impose unlimited conscription, hut Australia, with its limited manpower, cannot do anything of the sort."
"DTN","I agree with what the honorable gentleman says. I take it that he, too, agrees that Australia, with its limited man-power, cannot stretch it resources as far as can a country with unlimited man-power."
"JY7","That is no matter for the Government to consider. I definitely accept - one can do nothing else - the general principle that whatever government may be in power it will ensure that, as far as- possible our hold on this country shall, not be reduced to such n point that- it will be in danger. Obviously, opinions may differ as to what that point is. Whether the Government bo composed of honorable members who sit on this side of the House, a national government, or a Labour government, it will look first to its own defence; but if it to make its own defence an excuse for not sending troops out of Australia, no taking an adequate part in war operations, then the whole thing must break down in the eyes of the world."
"JY7","A few of them. I am not suggesting that we should send troops to Russia. These matters are not managed in that way. In the last war, our troops on Gallipoli neutralized a tremendous number of enemy troops. It is claimed by men who know what they are talking about that they thereby played a very important part in the- winning of the war. Their particular show - if I may use the expression - was not in itself successful, but it was most successful in its effects on the other operations of war. I have no objection to Australian troops being sent to any part to which the Government considers that they should be sent. I repeat, that when operations of this sort are being undertaken, secrecy is essential. There should be the power to send troops anywhere, without notification of the fact by the issue of a proclamation, without placarding it through the press or in any other way. Attack should be possible without reference of the matter to Parliament in order to ascertain its views. How can Parliament have a knowledge of the whole of the details? Therefore, I say, let any Commonwealth Government have full power to send troops wherever it may consider they should be sent in the general interests of the war. When I say, ' the war ', I do not mean the general interests of Australia so mud as the general interests of the Allies ir the winning of the war. What will the Dutch think of us - those people who have been most grossly betrayed? I do not know whether honorable member, have read a work entitled, The Rape of the Netherlands, by E. N. van Kleffens who was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands Government, in which he describes how the Dutch after the last war took a lot of German children who were suffering from rickets and other complaints, fed them for years, and saw that they were preserved in a normal state of health. When this war broke out, it was learned that a lot of those children not only had been engaged in espionage, but became active spies against the nation which had befriended them during a1' those years. What are the Dutch likely to think of people who are not prepared to stand up to their great indebtedness? What about the countries that have been overrun and are awaiting release - Norway, Poland, which has been ravaged in a way that is almost unknown in modern times; Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, in which the people of a whole village are taken as hostages and later are shot, the village being razed to the ground, because of the shooting of one German officer? That is total war. That is what one has to think of when dealing with a bill of this character; not of pushing a zone a few miles farther out, saying to the Australian Imperial Force troops, 'Fall in', and to the Citizen Military Forces troops, ' Fall out '. I do not know the meaning of the word ' global ' if that be global war. I have one claim to a right to speak about the people of the nations to which I have just referred. Through no merit of my own I happened to have been brought up, to some degree, on the other side of the world, and I have returned to Europe on numerous occasions. For many years I have been greatly interested in foreign affairs, and I have visited Great Britain, not merely to see and enjoy the beauties of the homeland, and the qualities of its people, great as they are, but also to follow up my study of foreign affairs. With the possible exception of one honorable member, I suppose that I have visited more European countries .than anybody else in this chamber. I was in Spain a few months before King Alfonso left the throne, and I visited Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria where I had been earlier in 1937. I have visited all parts of Europe from Holland to Italy and Sicily. I do not pretend to know so much about the United States of America, although I have visited that country a couple of times. I have a fair idea of what the people of those overseas countries are thinking now about some of the things that have been done in Australia. I know the people of Great Britain so well that it is not necessary for me to write and ask them what they think about Australia. They do not approve what has been done here, but they do not say so. There are other people, however, who do not like our attitude, and will say so. Australia, with its huge territory and small population, should take thought to make some friends for itself in the world. Some years ago, Mr. Crofts, a respected member of the Australian Labour party, was one of our delegates to the International Labour Conference at Geneva, and on his return to Australia he confessed his surprise to have found that Australians seemed to be unpopular overseas. The reason why the people of other countries do not like us is that we are selfish. That is the position in a nutshell. The bill before the House is no merger whatever. Ever since the last war I have been in favour of conscription. I had over three years' experience in that war, and I observed that the supply of reinforcements was constantly falling off. The best of our men had already gone to the front and many of them had paid the supreme sacrifice. Many others gradually joined up. They were not intimadated so much as shamed into enlisting, but they did well. I do not believe that there is any specific bravery in one man as compared with another, except in a few isolated cases. Some men seem to have a valour that is undaunted in any circumstances, but others simply ' cannot take it '. They are essentially timid - perhaps for some psychological reason. The average man, after having gone through the initial stage of war service, is just as good as the next. I think that it is all wrong that the flower of the manhood of the country should be killed off while others who are not so public-spirited should be left. Under th voluntary system of enlistment, many men conscientiously make up their mindthat their first duty is to their wives and families, and I believe that they would be devoutly thankful if their right to choose between service at the front and remaining at home were taken from them. Conscription provides the only means by which reinforcements can regularly be provided. The Prime Minister referred to Field Marshal Smuts. Think of the tremendous task that that notable statesman has had to deal with because of the disloyalty in South Africa. If any statesman in colonial history has deserved well of his nation, or of the British Commonwealth of '.Nations, it is he, as reference to the quarterly articles on South Africa in The Round Table during this war will show. . The area of Africa is four time3 that of Australia, although the white population of the Union of South Africa is only about 2,000,000 as against our 7,000,000. Australia could be taken up and dumped down in the Sahara and Libyan deserts. I consider that Field Marshal Smuts has put up a superb performance. Has any honorable member been able to foretell how this war would develop, or to what parts of the world it would extend? There have been great surprises. The battle on the European front may not be decided first, but all the indications are that it will be. Great Britain and the United States of America have said that they will then throw their full weight into the struggle in the Pacific area. Are Australian troops to remain in this area, or are they to fight alongside the troops of Great Britain? Are we to expect the United States of America to wage the warfare that may be necessary beyond the zone fixed by this bill? If the Government desires power to fight this war to the finish, it should take full power now. That is why I support the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Barker, than whom no man in this House has more frequently pointed out the dangers in which this country stands, and in which it may find itself in future. In the last war Great Britain adopted conscription, and by that means its troops were reinforced. Australia did not apply conscription, with the result that its soldiers had to fight on without receiving the leave that they needed. Does any one stand for that? Well, I do not. In the last war it was found that the effective fighting life of a man in the line was not much more than two and a half years. There were some very phlegmatic men who might be able to last as long as three years, or more, but there were others who fell sick and had to be sent out after a much shorter time than two and a half years. My recollection is that, in the Royal Air Force, men were ' grounded ' after eighteen months. That was in the last war, and we know that the strain is much greater on men in this war. We have not been there to see, but we have read of what the men have to go through. The Papuan campaign, in which our men have been engaged, was probably as difficult as any campaign could be. Are we to ask the men who have fought through such conditions to go on fighting until they are either killed or so maimed that they cannot fight any more? That would be an unworthy request to make. Here are a few instances of how the war is hitting some people. I know of a widow who had six sons, of whom one is a youth below military age. The other five enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and three of them have been killed. The mother received notice of the death of two of them in the same week. Within the last few weeks I have had the unhappy duty of writing to three of my friends who have each lost two sons. In two of those instances those were the only sons the parents had. Another friend of mine, whose son was lost flying in Africa, told me that out of 70 young men who had gone away as pilots at the same time as his son, 63 were either dead or missing - and that was some months ago. Are we to do nothing to ensure that men are available to take their places? Are the same men to be put into the line time after time, and no attempt made to spare them? 1 know of one young officer who was badly wounded in North Africa. He was brought back to Australia, and, when he recovered, was sent to Papua. He was wounded there, and brought back to Australia for a few weeks leave, after which he was sent to New Guinea again, where he has been wounded a third time, ls he to be sent back again and again until he is killed? I know that it is impossible to fight a war without losses. Every soldier knows that, but I believe it to be a monstrous system under which the public-spirited men who enlist in the defence of their country must face all the danger, while others are left behind. The only reasonable thing to do is to spread the risk - which probably means the casualties - over the whole of the population insofar as we can. The Government will probably ask - where we are to get the men? No doubt we shall be reminded of the dearth of man-power, something of which most of us were aware a good while ago. I began discussing it with the then Minister for Labour and National .Service in February of last year, when I pointed, out that, unless great care was taken, the country areas would be denuded of labour. The question then arises, where are we to get men for the relief of those already in the fighting forces? 'Well, there are too many men working in industrial concerns at the present time. In South Australia, I should think, there are between 20,000 and 30,000 young men, single and physically fit, working in industrial concerns."
"L0G","There have been some bad reports about Australia. Unfortunately there is no means of verifying these reports, but they get about. I am afraid ultimately somebody will have to have some courage and put these things in such a tactful but firm way that the relationships between the two countries are, in the public mind, improved. We are so blooming polite in this country, so I am told, that we do not say just what we should, and I have been advised by some Australians over here that it would do good if we were to speak out at times. However, the job that individuals can do is to deal with these dissensions when they arise in the spirit that while they quite likely may have foundation it is a waste of time to go into them, and that our job is to win the war and afterwards to work together. You would be astonished to know that there are some quite intelligent people in the City of London who think that Australians are going to work in with Americ a, and only be attached to this country in a sentimental way. Personally, I believe there is no reason why the relationship should be other than good after the war, provided there is a, frank exchange of views, and where there is a tendency to boast and throw undue weight about, to rub in some of the failures of the past."
"L0G","I also receive similar letters from friends in the United States of America, from which country has emanated rather severe criticism of our attitude in this 'war. Honorable members will recall that the first criticism of that kind was voiced over the air by the well-known American commentator, Mr. William Winter. He asked why it was that American troops can be employed in any part of the world wherever the enemy is found, whilst, at the same time, only a portion of Australian troops can be so employed. That is not a nice report. However, it is being repeated, in substance, throughout the American press generally. This measure is not calculated to still such criticism. Many people abroad believe that we are still thinking mainly of ourselves, and our personal safety, and are not concerned with the fortunes of the Allied cause as a whole. The Government may not be wholly responsible for that position1; but it is inclined to view the war through the rose-coloured spectacles of its own complacency. We should endeavour to obtain an accurate idea of the effect of our actions in relation to this world struggle. We are not prone to criticize ourselves, but rather regard everything that we do as right and proper. The Minister for the Army said to-day that we must stand up and say that we are doing the right thing. We should slap ourselves on the back. That is entirely wrong. It behoves us to do the right thing, and talk less about it. What will be the effect of th is measure on Australian pr is oners of war in the Far East? The Attorney-General said that he did not believe that many of our men were left in Malaya. That is probably correct. They may have been transferred to Indo-China, Thailand or Formosa, but the fact remains that they are still in captivity, and live under coolie conditions in hostile lands in a trying climate, with an inadequate food supply. To those people, th is measure will bring very little hope. Wc in Australia can send to those unfortunate pr is oners a message of greater hope than that which is embodied in th is bill, and I believe that every man and woman in Australia would, if asked, reply to their call with these words, ' Have patience, we are coming. If necessary, we will all come.' In saying these things and particularly in criticizing the action of the Prime Min is ter for introducing the bill in the manner in which he did, I recognize that the Government is bound hand and foot by party rules and regulations.But in war, what is required is flexibility of thought and of action. It is impossible for any country to wage a war successfully if the Government is firmly tied by the rules and regulations of an antiquated platform. It is surely little short of madness for any country to entrust the conduct of a war to a government whose actions and policies are dictated by men - in most cases union bosses - who have little knowledge of the real is sues, and no knowledge of the requirements of the military situation either here or in other parts of the world. Their opposition toconscription dates back many years in Australia, but the roots are really to be found in the h is tory of our race. In Britain, there has been a great d is like of anything military since the rule of Cromwell. That spirit has always shown itself, despite the fact that during the 18th century Britain ra is ed armies and used them abroad with varying success. To realize the deep feeling of the Brit is h people against conscription, we have only to recall that in peace-time, the government must renew the Army Act annually. If that feeling ex is ted in Britain, there is every reason why it should be found in Australia, because we have inherited Brit is h traditions and have adopted the Brit is h form of government. But the feelings of Australians in th is matter have been accentuated far beyond what one finds in Great Britain. The explanation is that from the time of our infancy till we attained nationhood, we lived in one of those rare periods of the world'sh is tory when nations were at peace, andwe accepted those conditions as being typical of our way of life. Of course, our freedom from attack was due entirely to the pax Britannica, but our ideas of military matters, as well as many other matters, are far behind the modern times in which we live. Times change and ideas always die slowly; but nowhere do they die more slowly than in th is country, and nowhere in Australia more slowly than in the ranks of the Labour party. The reason why that should be is not difficult to understand. The Labour party lives in bygone days, particularly in military matters. The Labour party is the most conservative party in th is country, because it adheres rigidly to outmoded ideas. Its policy is based on wornout shibboleths which prevailed 50 years ago. In no respect have Labour supporters been more conservative than in their attitude towards the Australian Army. In Great Britain the same ideas obtained until the beginning of the last war. In 1914 Britain had two armies, namely, the regular army, which could be despatched for service in any part of the world, and the territorial army, which was ra is ed for home defence. After the outbreak of war. the Brit is h Government quickly realized that the best form of defence was offence and leg is lation was introduced to permit the territorial army to serve on the same bas is as the regular army. Before the outbreak of the present war Great Britain introduced conscription, and. the conscripts were available for action anywhere. But Australia, in spite of th is lessons learnt from the last war and of the omens that the Ax is was po is ed in readiness to strike at the Brit is h Empire, remained , bound by ideas which were suited to conditions 50 years ago. Recently the Min is ter for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward) suggested that volunteer troopswere far superior to conscripts, and expressed the view that a man. would fight, with better heart on h is native soil than in some foreign land. I pay no particular heed to the views of the Min is ter, particularly on military matters, becausehe has never been within miles of an operational front. I refer to h is statement merely to point out that h is beliefs are shared by many members of the Labour party. In the last war I foughtwith the French and the Brit is h, who had been compulsorily called to the colours, and officers and men whowere on that section of the frontwith me will affirm my contention that the conscripts foughtwith the same bravery and efficiency as any volunteer. No one who has fought against the Germans will deny that they are brave, efficient and enthusiastic soldiers, in spite of the fact that they are compulsorily enl is ted. More often than not, the German fights not on h is native soil but in foreign countries."
"KX7","The transfer of workers from one industry to another should be on the approved basis of a greater need for skilled tradesmen in another factory or a greater concentration of men in order to stimulate production of a certain kind. Unfortunately, at the present time, transfers are effected to allow employees to get higher wages."
"BV8","1.Which members of this Parliament are entitled to the sole use of a sleeping compartment when travelling by rail? 2.When was each such member granted this privilege, and why? 3.In view of the great difficulties being experienced by the general public in securing travel facilities, will he consider withdrawing such privilege from all members?"
"009FQ","1. Subject to 3 below — Ministers, past Prime Ministers, members of the Advisory War Council. 2.The privilege in respect of Ministers dates back to May, 1928, and was granted to enable them to carry out official duties in private whilst travelling between capital cities. The extension of the privilege to former Prime Ministers was n;pprovcd in October, 1941, and to non-Government members of the Advisory War Council in February, 1942. 3. In order to meet the heavy demand which frequently occurs in respect of defence personnel and persons travelling on urgent business directly associated with the war effort, the Government decided as from 14th December, 1942, to modify the travel privileges which had been extended to Ministers and others. So far as members of Parliament are concerned the unconditional reservation of sleeping berth cabins for sole use will be confined to the Prime Minister. All other reservations will be conditional and subject to accommodation being available and not required by other priority passengers travelling on essential business. On the Overland Express between Melbourne and Adelaide on which only one sleeping car is provided reservations for solo use will not be made in any circumstances."
