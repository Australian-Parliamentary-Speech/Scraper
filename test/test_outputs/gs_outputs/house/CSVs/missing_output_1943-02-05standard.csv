"KNX","The Navy was at the highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable exploits of some of its ships overseas. The home defence army was well trained, and its equipment had been greatly improved. The strength of the Air Force had been largely increased, both in respect of home defence squadrons and the training resources of the Empire Air Scheme. The equipment of the Air Force had also been much improved."
"KNX","On the Wednesd a y fixed upon, you will be expected to show that, under a strong provocation, willing a general holiday, you shall have it in the teeth of a lying press and a recreant Parliament. Not a cab, bus, tram or train should run, not a ship should sail, not a shop or factory or hotel or theatre should be open; not a newspaper should come out: not a butcher's, baker's or grocer's cart should be seen in the streets; not a man of the all- powerful working class should be at work. Will you, as a unionist, help in the success of this policy? It is a policy for the protection and preservation of trades unionism, with all that it implies in better wages and conditions through the glorious gospel and might of organization."
"KHL","Hear, hear!"
"DTN","I do not say that it is. The suggestion by the honorable member for New England that there had been some failure by us to meet the implied obligations of Australia as one of the leading nations engaged in the South-west Pacific Area cannot be supported. Every requisition for the movement of forces or material made upon this Government has been complied with. In the face of this no one should decry what Australia has done, is doing, and will do to achieve final victory. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there should be no question of party in this matter, but the Leader of the Opposition fails to answer the Prime Minister's case which is - That for a substantial period of time ahead the man-power resources of the country do not permit of the employment of the Militia to an extent greater than is suggested in the proposed boundary. That this boundary will not limit in any way the utilization of other Australian service units wherever they can best serve the Allied cause. The present strategic plan for the theatre of war in which Australia has a very special responsibility and interest suggests further concentration of our human and material resources within that area, with two objectives - preserving Australia against invasion, and carrying out Australia's part in any offensives that may from time to time be determined. The Government, especially the Minister for Defence, is the best judge of what the security of the country requires and permits. In. his considered opinion the present plan offers a practicable solution of a difficult and delicate problem. Its adoption does not prejudice future revision by Parliament of the plan. At the present I submit that the plan should be followed. There are two fundamental principles which are carried into effect by the bill - first, the present plan fulfils all the needs of General MacArthur's strategy not only for the present but also for a substantial period ahead of us. These needs are not measured in any niggardly way. The extended area is a vast one and those who measure it on Mercator's- projection will be grievously misled. Equally, it is wrong to hold out the chimera of an immediate conquest of the vast area which is embraced by the present proposal. Grandiose schemes not based on any realistic and practical or common sense assessment of the agreed strategy and our present resources, and the available allied resorces, will turn out to be a delusion and a snare, and may lead to utter disaster to a young nation, the war effort of which has been magnificent. In these matters what is practical and possible is also what is best. The present task set us is a great and noble one; let us unite to perform it."
"JY7","This much-heralded bill, which, I take it, has been the subject of countless conferences between the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) and others, with both the Central Branch of the Australian Labour party and, through it, with the State branches, is at last before the Parliament. One had been led to expect something which would be epoch-making; but this measure is what has been produced. The best way to prove the success or otherwise of the Government in producing this bill is to review the debate which has taken place here during the last two days. There has been a general chorus of criticism from this side of the chamber, whilst from the other side, apart from Ministers, only two private members have spoken. Both of them - I refer to the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) and the honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) - criticized the measure caustically, the former going so far as to say that he hoped to see it defeated. Apart from support from the ministerial bench, the bill has not received any approval whatsoever in this House. That is evidence of its poor quality, notwithstanding all the cogitation about it before its introduction. There is, in consequence, a feeling of unreality about the whole of the proceedings. If ever there was a time when proceedings in the world outside ought to be brought keenly to our notice, it is now, and therefore a bill which itself is unreal and which elicits very little interest either in this House or elsewhere is not adequate to meet the needs of the time. I desire to say a few words about zones, although I shall not go into details. The difficulty which members of this chamber have experienced has been to know what the South-western Pacific Zone really is. The honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) made a speech in this chamber early in December last, and I listened to it with keen interest because the honorable member indicated at least what the supposed zone was. Up till the n, one could only assume that the area, wherever it was situated, was south of the equator. The honorable member quoted from an American publication which has been described as the best-informed review of foreign affairs. After the last war, when I was in the United States of America, I was told that if I wished to read anything on foreign affairs, I should he welladvised to get the Christian Science Monitor. According to that publication, it appears that a zone is known in the United States of America as being the presumed zone of operations. I presume, the refore, that that zone is also known to the people of Great Britain. The remarks of the honorable member for Bourke on that occasion were censored, and do not appear in the records of the proceedings of this chamber. Yet the information which he gave to this House was available in the United States of America, and, as I have said, presumably in Great Britain also. I think that the honorable member's remarks were of such interest and importance that the y should be incorporated, as an addendum, in a later number of Hansard. Why should the people of Australia be deprived of information which is passed on to the m from this Parliament, when similar facts are known in. o the r countries? I admit the difficulty of applying a general censorship to different countries, but the honorable gentleman's remarks were censored on the ground of national safety, and that ground for the ir exclusion no longer can be advanced, seeing that similar information was published in the United States of America and Great Britain, the censored remarks should be reincorporated in Hansard. I shall not say much about the zone except to endorse what the right honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) said about General MacArthur's command. Why should our troops be confined to a specific command? Let me put a case to the House. I have listened with interest to the speeches which have been delivered here this week, but I have not heard much about our sister dominion of New Zealand. It is imaginable that New Zealand may be attacked, and not Australia. Should faha* happen, our Militia Forces could not, under this ball, be sent to New Zealand's aid, although members of the Australian Imperial Force could be sent the re. That would be deplorable. I always thought that the Labour party, as well .as of every o the r section of the , COntmunity, regarded New Zealand as a younger bro the r or sister, and that if a-ny one had a call upon us in an emergency it was the people of New Zealand. Shall we promote a better feeling between ourselves and o the r members of the British Commonwealth of Nations if we -make it impossible for our Militia Forces to assist a -sister dominion in an emergency? When the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) moved his amendment, I seconded it with great heartiness, and I am prepared to accept the responsibility for my action. The bill does not go far enough. If I may say so. St, is not so much a bill of expansion as of limitation. It will be so regarded by ' all foreign nations, -whether allies or foes. The measure before us is an intimation to our enemies that we shall not send troops any further than, has been prescribed, without first giving due notice to them. I am aware that there may be differences of opinion in these matters, but I do suggest to any open-minded man that it is better to have a general power which is likely to be wisely exercised, than a limited power which has constantly to be increased. I say, without the slightest fear of successful contradiction, that what Professor Dicey used to call ' the internal sanction ' applies here, and that no government will denude its own country of adequate defence. Risks may have to be taken; but we can presuppose that there will be no attempt to send such a large number of men overseas as would render this country liable to successful attack. There are two angles from which we can look at this matter. There is, first, the old Australian angle with which I hope to deal later; and, .secondly, the more important .angle at the present time, namely, the international aspect. Has any one who has sponsored this bill considered adequately the international reactions to it? What will be the opinion of the people of Great Britain, to whom we owe more than to any one else? What are likely to be that country's reactions to a bill like this, in view , 01 what its people have suffered in this war? In Great Britain, women as well as men have been conscripted, and the people have had to stand up to a war on their very doorsteps for a longer period than is customary in the case of men. in the firing line. Is the .exclusion of New Zealand likely to make us more 'beloved in the other dominions of the British 'Commonwealth? What about the United States of America, to whom we owe so much, whose people have come here so willingly, in such large numbers, -and which has acted with such an open hand? Is it not inevitable, if we want to do our fa ir share in this war, that we must give fully when it is our -own safety rather than the .safety of the United States of America which is primarily at stake? I have considered for years that -Canada is perhaps in the most privileged position in the world, with the Pacific and the AtlanticOceans on either side and .a very friendly United States of America to the south. We are not in a similar position. We have been surrounded for years by islands which may have concealed enemies. For a number of years I have addressed myself to this subject so' forcefully in speeches as to contract a sore throat. I have stressed the necessity for our realizing that Japan has a population of 70,000,000 cornpared with our 7,600,000; that it has had universal training of its manhood, and we have not. I asked what was likely to happen if a war occurred. That event has occurred. No one can deny that the two outstanding factors in those that have hitherto saved us have been the prodigious effort of the Motherland and the great assistance given to us most willingly ir the United States of America. Are not we to make an adequate return, .small in number though -we may be? The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) said this morning what I do not think one would have dreamt of his saying when he was a Justice of the High Court of Australia. Referring to conscription, he said that countries which have unlimited! manpower can impose unlimited conscription, hut Australia, with its limited manpower, cannot do anything of the sort."
"JY7","That is no matter for the Government to consider. I definitely accept - one can do nothing else - the general principle that whatever government may be in power it will ensure that, as far as- possible our hold on this country shall, not be reduced to such n point that- it will be in danger. Obviously, opinions may differ as to what that point is. Whether the Government bo composed of honorable members who sit on this side of the House, a national government, or a Labour government, it will look first to its own defence; but if it to make its own defence an excuse for not sending troops out of Australia, no taking an adequate part in war operations, then the whole thing must break down in the eyes of the world."
"L0G","I also receive similar letters from friends in the United States of America, from which country has emanated rather severe criticism of our attitude in this 'war. Honorable members will recall that the first criticism of that kind was voiced over the air by the well-known American commentator, Mr. William Winter. He asked why it was that American troops can be employed in any part of the world wherever the enemy is found, whilst, at the same time, only a portion of Australian troops can be so employed. That is not a nice report. However, it is being repeated, in substance, throughout the American press generally. This measure is not calculated to still such criticism. Many people abroad believe that we are still thinking mainly of ourselves, and our personal safety, and are not concerned with the fortunes of the Allied cause as a whole. The Government may not be wholly responsible for that position1; but it is inclined to view the war through the rose-coloured spectacles of its own complacency. We should endeavour to obtain an accurate idea of the effect of our actions in relation to this world struggle. We are not prone to criticize ourselves, but rather regard everything that we do as right and proper. The Minister for the Army said to-day that we must stand up and say that we are doing the right thing. We should slap ourselves on the back. That is entirely wrong. It behoves us to do the right thing, and talk less about it. What will be the effect of th is measure on Australian pr is oners of war in the Far East? The Attorney-General said that he did not believe that many of our men were left in Malaya. That is probably correct. They may have been transferred to Indo-China, Thailand or Formosa, but the fact remains that they are still in captivity, and live under coolie conditions in hostile lands in a trying climate, with an inadequate food supply. To those people, th is measure will bring very little hope. Wc in Australia can send to those unfortunate pr is oners a message of greater hope than that which is embodied in th is bill, and I believe that every man and woman in Australia would, if asked, reply to their call with these words, ' Have patience, we are coming. If necessary, we will all come.' In saying these things and particularly in criticizing the action of the Prime Min is ter for introducing the bill in the manner in which he did, I recognize that the Government is bound hand and foot by party rules and regulations.But in war, what is required is flexibility of thought and of action. It is impossible for any country to wage a war successfully if the Government is firmly tied by the rules and regulations of an antiquated platform. It is surely little short of madness for any country to entrust the conduct of a war to a government whose actions and policies are dictated by men - in most cases union bosses - who have little knowledge of the real is sues, and no knowledge of the requirements of the military situation either here or in other parts of the world. Their opposition toconscription dates back many years in Australia, but the roots are really to be found in the h is tory of our race. In Britain, there has been a great d is like of anything military since the rule of Cromwell. That spirit has always shown itself, despite the fact that during the 18th century Britain ra is ed armies and used them abroad with varying success. To realize the deep feeling of the Brit is h people against conscription, we have only to recall that in peace-time, the government must renew the Army Act annually. If that feeling ex is ted in Britain, there is every reason why it should be found in Australia, because we have inherited Brit is h traditions and have adopted the Brit is h form of government. But the feelings of Australians in th is matter have been accentuated far beyond what one finds in Great Britain. The explanation is that from the time of our infancy till we attained nationhood, we lived in one of those rare periods of the world'sh is tory when nations were at peace, andwe accepted those conditions as being typical of our way of life. Of course, our freedom from attack was due entirely to the pax Britannica, but our ideas of military matters, as well as many other matters, are far behind the modern times in which we live. Times change and ideas always die slowly; but nowhere do they die more slowly than in th is country, and nowhere in Australia more slowly than in the ranks of the Labour party. The reason why that should be is not difficult to understand. The Labour party lives in bygone days, particularly in military matters. The Labour party is the most conservative party in th is country, because it adheres rigidly to outmoded ideas. Its policy is based on wornout shibboleths which prevailed 50 years ago. In no respect have Labour supporters been more conservative than in their attitude towards the Australian Army. In Great Britain the same ideas obtained until the beginning of the last war. In 1914 Britain had two armies, namely, the regular army, which could be despatched for service in any part of the world, and the territorial army, which was ra is ed for home defence. After the outbreak of war. the Brit is h Government quickly realized that the best form of defence was offence and leg is lation was introduced to permit the territorial army to serve on the same bas is as the regular army. Before the outbreak of the present war Great Britain introduced conscription, and. the conscripts were available for action anywhere. But Australia, in spite of th is lessons learnt from the last war and of the omens that the Ax is was po is ed in readiness to strike at the Brit is h Empire, remained , bound by ideas which were suited to conditions 50 years ago. Recently the Min is ter for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward) suggested that volunteer troopswere far superior to conscripts, and expressed the view that a man. would fight, with better heart on h is native soil than in some foreign land. I pay no particular heed to the views of the Min is ter, particularly on military matters, becausehe has never been within miles of an operational front. I refer to h is statement merely to point out that h is beliefs are shared by many members of the Labour party. In the last war I foughtwith the French and the Brit is h, who had been compulsorily called to the colours, and officers and men whowere on that section of the frontwith me will affirm my contention that the conscripts foughtwith the same bravery and efficiency as any volunteer. No one who has fought against the Germans will deny that they are brave, efficient and enthusiastic soldiers, in spite of the fact that they are compulsorily enl is ted. More often than not, the German fights not on h is native soil but in foreign countries."
"KX7","The transfer of workers from one industry to another should be on the approved basis of a greater need for skilled tradesmen in another factory or a greater concentration of men in order to stimulate production of a certain kind.

"009FQ","1. Subject to 3 below — Ministers, past Prime Ministers, members of the Advisory War Council. 2.The privilege in respect of Ministers dates back to May, 1928, and was granted to enable them to carry out official duties in private whilst travelling between capital cities. The extension of the privilege to former Prime Ministers was n;pprovcd in October, 1941, and to non-Government members of the Advisory War Council in February, 1942. 3. In order to meet the heavy demand which frequently occurs in respect of defence personnel and persons travelling on urgent business directly associated with the war effort, the Government decided as from 14th December, 1942, to modify the travel privileges which had been extended to Ministers and others. So far as members of Parliament are concerned the unconditional reservation of sleeping berth cabins for sole use will be confined to the Prime Minister. All other reservations will be conditional and subject to accommodation being available and not required by other priority passengers travelling on essential business. On the Overland Express between Melbourne and Adelaide on which only one sleeping car is provided reservations for solo use will not be made in any circumstances."
