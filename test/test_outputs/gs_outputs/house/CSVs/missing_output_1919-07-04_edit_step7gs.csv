"KXG","With your concurrence, Mr. Speaker, may I interpose. I regret that I was absent when the incident to which my attention has been directed took place. I am entirely ignorant of its nature except that I am given to understand by my honorable colleague (Mr. Groom) that interjections have been made in defiance of the order of the Chair. That is not uncommon when feeling runs high. But it is also a very common incident that when honorable members have had time to reflect, they see the wisdom of obeying the Chair, no matter on what side of the House they sit. I take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to supplement your appeal to the honorable member that he will obey the ruling of the Chair, as all honorable members from the Leader of the House downwards have to do."
"N/A","Several honorable members interjecting,"
"10000","Order! I took the somewhat unusual course of suspending the sitting in order to afford some honorable members sufficient time for calm reflection, in the hope that they would recognise the seriousness of the position that was developing. One of the duties imposed upon me, as the presiding officer of the House, is to see that the rules are. respected. I must therefore ask the honorable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine), now that he has had ample time for reflection, to withdraw the words of which complaint was made at the time of the interruption of our proceedings."
"JTC","I am not prepared to admit that he is the best friend of the soldiers, but he is a very good one. I do not, however, want to discuss Mr. Keith Murdoch. The point is that the arrangements made were that, during December, 14,000 men should he sent away. In mistake, I gave the figure just now as 12,000 men. There were to be 16,000 sent in January; 18,000 in February; and so on, increasing by 2,000 each month. Those arrangements were made in December. Mr. Keith Murdoch wrote his letter on 8th December; but the arrangements of the Demobilization Department with the Shipping Comptroller were upon the basis I have quoted. The Government have been charged that they deliberately blocked men from coming home. They did nothing of the sort. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition quoted certain figures regarding the number of men despatched during December, January, and February. Those figures, I believe, are correct. They are certainly not up to the totals which I have just quoted, the reason being that the Imperial Government could not provide the ships. The Shipping Comptroller could not keep anywhere near to his original agreement with the Australian Military authorities. In regard to the figures which Mr. Higgs quoted, it must be kept in mind that in February there was a tremendous slump. The total went down to about 4,000 or 5,000 men. That was directly due to the great strike throughout the United Kingdom among the men responsible for refitting and finishing the fittings on troopships. It was not a question of a strike among waterside workers, as we know that body in Australia, or of a strike of seamen; it affected carpenters and artisans. The trouble was not settled in London and Southampton until some considerable time after matters had become normal in other ports. We felt the effect of the strike in February, mainly because the ships which had been allotted to the Australian troops by the Shipping Comptroller were in the Thames and at Southampton Docks. That fact explains the fall in the February returns. General Monash - as Mr. Murdoch cabled in the extract which I have just quoted - knowing that the Australians would include a very large number of unionists, and that they would not desire, unless circumstances were very grave, to attempt to take the places of the men on strike, simply put the whole case before the men themselves. I know, from personal contact with the situation, that he stated the position to the men who were to come home on one ship in particular, and that was the Euripides. He said, in effect, 'There is the ship at Tilbury Docks at the present moment. I cannot control the strike. I am not in any sense responsible for it. On the other hand, I cannot secure a vessel from the Shipping Comptroller to replace that ship. It is for you men now to say whether you will take the place of these who are not at work, and prepare the ship to be sent home with yourselves on board.' Thereupon a number of the Australian troops concerned undertook to fit that ship as well as others; and that is how the difficulty was overcome. Moreover, Mr. Keith Murdoch told the Australian people on the 28th February that that was so; and I can support what he wrote, because it was an absolute fact. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made another statement to the effect that strong pressure would secure ships."
"JTC","I beg the honorable member's pardon. I was under the impression that he had made it as his own statement. I only know this, that General Monash and his staff, and Mr. Hughes on every conceivable occasion, and Sir Joseph Cook at every opportunity, did their utmost to get shipping from the Comptroller. Honorable' members opposite, however, should place themselves in the shoes of the Comptroller. That official had not only the Australians to consider - he had to provide for the transport of food supplies to England. He knew that there was food to be got from the United States and Canada. He was compelled to bring the foodstuffs from the nearest points first, in, order to relieve the tension. British public opinion would never have stood for an official who would say, 'Let us put all the ships on the Australian run. Let us send all the Australian troops home in them. There is food to be got from Australia; but I will admit, that the ships will be away for six months, while, if I were to send vessels to Canada they would be there and back with foodstuffs within a month.' We should endeavour to realize, also, some of the difficulties which our representatives in the Old Country have been, and are, up against. It is not simply a case of putting up their hands and saying, 'We demand the ships.' Mr. Keith Murdoch knew that as well as I did. General Wisdom was appointed to take charge of transportation organization. I met him a few days before I left London, and I shall mention what was said at that meeting merely to indicate the attitude of responsible officials concerning demobilization. General Wisdom was in high glee. He said, 'I have just secured another ship which the Canadians had had on offer, but which they have not been able to use. I have persuaded the Shipping Comptroller to turn it over to the use of the Australians; and, although it means that we must prepare our draft and make ready all the necessary information after the men have been selected, and that we shall have only five days in which to do it, I have nevertheless agreed that we shall fill the ship and send her out.' That officer has been right through the mill, starting as a major and finishing as a brigadier. He knows the game. He knew what the Australian soldiers wanted. He was so keen over getting that extra ship that he showed his gratification in unmistakable manner. While honorable members in this House criticise the Government and hold them responsible, they must remember that the individual administrative duties in London are being performed by men who are as keen to get the Australian soldier back home as anybody out here in Australia."
"JTC","I stated that I knew positively of the Euripides. That happened to be because I had been placed on the boat roll to sail on the vessel. I might add that it was owing to influenza that I was unable to travel upon her."
"JTC","The honorable member has no right to judge unless he knows. He asked me a little while ago to prove something, and I do not wish to retaliate by asking him to prove his statement, because he does not know the facts."
"JTC","The honorable member for Kennedy (Mr. McDonald) by interjection asked when the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) would reply, and the Acting Prime Minister was good enough to refer to myself in connexion with demobilizaton matters."
"JPV","He called upon you to give your testimony."
"JTC","It is more than testimony; it is proof. The honorable member for Kennedy asked in a rather sneering way if I knew anything about the French end of demobilization? The Imperial Head-quarters, which controlled the Australian Imperial Force, were in London, and an organization which is controlled by another must of necessity have its central administration at the point where the other is operating. That was the reason for the establishment of our central administration for demobilization in London. Any person who was aware of the great trouble occasioned by the delays to mails, and the unsatisfactory method of making use of telegrams between France and England, can realize how difficult it was to carry on dealings between the two places, and how necessary it was to have the demobilization head-quarters in London."
"KWL","The complaint here was that returned soldiers did not have the opportunity of getting those positions, and that men who had not seen a day's active service were chosen in preference to them."
"JTC","It is evidently a double-barrelled complaint, but I believe I am right in saying that quite a number of the men who went away from here - in fact, about half of them - have seen overseas service. Sitting suspended from 1 till 2.15 p.m. While I commend the promptitude with which the Government dealt with the work of demobilization in London after the armistice had been signed, I do not think that the complexities of the undertaking were realized by Ministers here, nor did the Government in Australia, in my judgment, make the preparatory arrangements which ought to have been made before the armistice. The matter was brought under the notice of the Government in July and August of last year, but while the demobilization schemes of other countries, including some of the Dominions of the Empire, had been outlined and agreed upon by their respective Administrations, we in Australia were undecided. Various propositions were put to the Government, but were neither rejected nor accepted. Some little time might have been saved in organizing the Demobilization Department in London had proper attention been given to the original suggestion put forward from the Imperial end. I am glad that the Leader of the Government requested me to deal with the demobilization proposition. Before I left the Old Country, General Monash also asked me, not only to advise members of the Cabinet here as to what was taking place, but also to make it as widely known as possible, since he recognised that the work he was undertaking, which was not perfect in his eyes, needed some explanation, in order that the people, and particularly the members of this Parliament, might appreciate some of the difficulties associated with it. Turning to the repatriation proposals in the Ministerial statement, I say quite frankly that my brief experience in my constituency taught me that the work of repatriation bristled with difficulties. The Department entered upon it without any precedents for its guidance. Precedents had to be created from day to day and week to week, and at the outset the machinery governing . the repatriation effort was necessarily imperfect. There have been individual cases where the regulations framed under the Act have pressed harshly, and, in the view of some honorable members, rather unjustly, but my experience of the Department is that it is not only sympathetic in its treatment of the returned soldier, but does its utmost to meet the varying and conflicting requests that are put forward. We all know that what suits one individual may not suit another, and that a regulation framed to-day to meet, perhaps, quite a number of cases of a particular kind may be apt to press heavily on other individual cases. Taking the work of the Department all through, however, when we find that, after allowing for the men who have returned to their former avocations without assistance, only 4 per cent of those who have been dealt with by the Department have not been satisfactorily placed, we must agree that its performance is most creditable. I was surprised that the honorable member for Brisbane (Mr. Finlayson) should have attempted to throw on the Government the whole responsibility for the industrial unrest prevalent throughout Australia to-day, on the ground that they had not made it easier for various unions to approach the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Every honorable member of this House is familiar with the constitutional and other difficulties that have been in the way, so that the honorable member, in seeking to lay the whole of the blame at the door of the Government, was most unjust. He knew perfectly well that his statement was incorrect. The effect of the return to civil employment of the men who have been fighting is not being felt in Australia only. The matter is one that affects the whole world, and industrial unrest to-day is world-wide. In to-day's newspapers there appears a cablegram reporting a speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), in which he clearly indicates that industrial unrest in the Old Country is a very pressing question, and reminds both Capital and Labour that in order to satisfactorily settle it, the greatest care must be exercised in the reabsorption of our tens of thousands of soldiers into civil employment. I believe that in this process a good deal of friction is inevitable, since it means the displacing of a great number of women workers and of others who necessarily filled the gap during the absence of our men at the front. That friction, however, is not going to be removed by the making of inflammatory speeches. Every honorable member should realize the responsibilities resting upon him, and if we are to assist in bringing about a better understanding between employer and employee, we should get to grips with the problem before the nation."
"JTC","The causes of industrial unrest are clearly associated not only with the industries and the technicalities relating thereto, but with the wider social, domestic, or national questions affecting the homes and domestic concerns of the people."
"JTC","I do not agree with that at all. It is not a question of 'getting the wind up' in their case. I remind the honorable member that the Government of the United Kingdom offered a shipyard as a going concern to different federations of the steel and iron trade, with permission to step into it, and pay for it on the very lengthiest of terms, or to run it for a given number of years to see what sort of a fist they made of it. There is no question of the British Government 'having the wind up' is there? Unfortunately, the workers' organizations, for some reason or other, turned the proposition down, according to cabled reports. Again, in West Hartlepool, a private employer offered his employees in a shipbuilding concern equal representation on the directorate, and, after the payment of their own and other salaries and working costs, an equal share in the profits. Sir Robert Hadfield in 'the Birmingham district did exactly the same thing. It is up to us on both sides of the House to do our part as responsible public men in introducing the idea of the alliance into our general commercial life, in order that, on the one hand, the man who does not believe that any good can come from labour may be converted, and, on the other, that the man who, as a representative of organized labour, thinks no good can come from the employer may be converted also, and that we may have a better tone, a more humane understanding, and a new spirit in the community, to use the phrase which honorable members opposite cheered just now. Industrial unrest is not confined to Australia. It is not the sin of this Government, nor would it be the sin of the Opposition if they were in power. The simple fact is that the whole world is feeling the strain, and unrest is showing itself everywhere."
"JTC","I went into the matter very closely, because I am sure the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. West) will take my assurance that I would not deal with the thing in a halfhearted way. I wanted to know the facts. They were good enough to furnish me with their audited balance-sheets, and I say distinctly that you have to get something more than a surface view to find out where the difficulty is. I do not profess to know how we are going to get at it. The honorable member for Cook (Mr. J. H. Catts), for instance, had a good deal to do at, one stage with price fixing. Owing to his work at that time, I believe the honorable member is a wiser man now than he was before he started, and so are a good many more of us, who have found out that it is not so easy to fix prices as it looks. If the States will exercise their functions, and check anything which appears on the surface to be an absolute profiteering 'ramp' that, I think, will be a sufficient check against that phase of it. But it does not go as deeply as I should like to see the inquiry go. I would like the Commonwealth, even with the crippled powers that it possesses, to make some effort to assist the States. In the district which I have the honour to represent we import a lot of goods from the eastern part of Australia. A Price Fixing Board has no more chance of controlling the prices of those goods than I have of receiving £1,000,000 tomorrow."
"JTC","We must press these questions again, because they are of urgent importance. Any honorable member who chooses to inquire into the matter will find that in regard to all importations into the Commonwealth we are controlled by the London Shipping Conference, which, in its turn, is controlled from the United Kingdom. The Empire, so far as I can, understand it, .is self-contained. At the present time we are a nation within a league of nations, and if we can arrange for the Imperial Government and the Dominions Governments to take united action to limit the percentage of profit that may be made by any individual, we shall have a reasonable chance of grappling with the ever-increasing cost of living."
"KEV","The honorable member who has just resumed his seat has made one or two valuable contributions to this debate, and, from my stand-point, one of the most valuable was his admission that the demobilization of our troops on the other side of the world had been in capable hands from its very inception. In saying that he proved that the presence of Senator Pearce in England was totally unnecessary."
"JTC","I did not say anything of the kind, and the honorable member must not put statements into my mouth which I did not utter."
"KEV","Speeches of a similar character were delivered by many at that deputation. Mr. Hughes, prior to leaving for Great Britain, had intimated by a speech in this House, and by some action he took, that the Government intended to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry. This was one of those high-flown titles which are given to some organizations, and which, though they impress some people, never impress me. I never had very much faith that this organization would do much for our Australian industries. We told Senator Pearce that the Bureau would be of very slow growth, would probably be controlled by a number of university professors, and that very little benefit would accrue from it to the industries and workers of Australia. We pointed out to him that organization as necessary, in order to prepare for the time when the war had come to an end. I have not Senator Pearce ' s reply to the deputation, but I can give the effect of it. He said that he quite realized that the representations made by the deputation were quite correct, that the Bureau of Science and Industry could not meet all the demands of Australia, and would certainly not satisfy the people of Australia in making their industries prosperous, establishing new industries, and providing employment for the people. He said he would take the representations of the deputation to Cabinet, and that the Government would endeavour to evolve a scheme to meet their wishes. I make bold to say that, had the Government at that time taken in hand the proper organization of industry in Australia, we would not be in the muddle in which we find ourselves to-day in regard to demobilization and unemployment. We should have done it long ago, and we are late in taking action, but we must do something in this matter. I am sorry that the honorable member for Fremantle is not here, because I propose to make a quotation from the London Times of 10th May of this year. I was looking over the file the other day, and from the latest number on it I extracted many valuable quotations. In the Times of the 10th May of this year there is an article which contains the following statement: -"
"KEV","Yes, this distress is increasing. I am not here to give expression to those eruptions that take place now and again, but it appears to me that what is happening now is symptomatic of the feelings in the community. For instance, I believe it is an absolute fact that in the constituency represented by the last speaker, the honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Burchell), it was necessary, recently, to restrain 200 returned soldiers, who were unemployed, from doing something serious by marching them through the various streets, singing songs until they had cooled down. This distress is present among soldiers, not only in Australia, but in Great Britain also. If any honorable member cares to read the English files - he will not find this information in the daily press of Australia, because it is carefully excluded in order to keep the people here in the dark - he will learn something of what is happening on the other side of the world. I believe, however, that the soldiers are making themselves heard in Great Britain to a greater extent than is the case here, and that the Imperial Government are making greater efforts to redress their grievances. Everybody knew, when the war broke out, that a considerable sum of money would be needed to pay our troops overseas, and while on war service, and to provide for their pensions and repatriation. Why, then, did not the Parliament exercise some of its powers, limited as they are under the Constitution, to obtain more revenue? Why did not the Government take over all insurance business - life, fire, and marine? I would even disregard any State proposition. At the outset of the war the British Government took over the whole of the marine insurance business, and made millions of pounds. Their control of this business is now helping them to pay the bill. Why should not Australia do the same, and obtain some of the big revenue that at present flows into the pockets of private individuals. France, I suppose, has done more in this direction, and enjoys more State monopolies than in any other countries. The latest State activity in France is the monopoly in the supply of petrol to the French people, by which the French Government expect to make £1,500,000 a year. Why should we not do the same in Australia? Why should not the Government control all supplies of kerosene, petrol, and other oils in Australia? Something should be done to develop the oil supplies of Papua and investigate our own resources. It would pay this House to set apart next Wednesday afternoon for the discussion of this subject, and to pass a vote of £500,000 for the development of our resources by boring, and the employment of such experts as Lord Cowdray obtained in Great Britain. For centuries the geologists of Great Britain had declared that there were no oil deposits within the United Kingdom., but quite recently a supply has been obtained at 3,000 feet. I understand a bore is yielding 400 gallons per day, and it is expected that further borings will very largely increase the supply. The opinion of a geologist need not be regarded as final. Events have proved that a first class practical oil-borer - a man thoroughly conversant with oil discovery in all its phases - is often the better man to decide this important question. I deplore the apathy in regard to the oil resources of Australia. For some years boring operations have been carried out in South Australia, and we are extracting oil from our shale deposits in other parts of the Commonwealth. I believe that eventually large supplies will be obtained from Papua, but greater vigour should be displayed in research and in exploratory work. The proper course is to nationalize the distribution of oil supplies throughout the Commonwealth, and to do away altogether with private enterprise, thus securing for the Commonwealth revenue the large profits that are at present being made out of the business. I speak as one who has resided in the country during the past twelve months, and whose illuminant is kerosene. I know only too well how great has been the increase in its' price as compared with the time when, first, I lived in the country in 1902. We have now to pay nearly three times as much for a tin of kerosene. Why is this so? Some people say it is because shipping is short. I know, however, that that is not the only reason. I remember reading that when America entered the war, the Secretary of the United, States Treasury, Mr. McAdoo, declared that it would be necessary to levy heavy income taxation upon the people of the United States, and he had some figures prepared indicating how the wealthier individuals of the Republic would be taxed. Rockefeller, the great oil king, was shown to have an income of about £12,000,000 per annum, and under the new income tax schedule he would be called upon to pay about £7,500,000 a year to the United States Treasury. Some people might think this was a pretty heavy impost; but Rockefeller stretched out his long arm, and with his big fist he is now dragging from every user of American kerosene an extra price for this particular commodity. Every other user of kerosene in the Commonwealth is now helping to pay Rockefeller's taxation to the United States Treasury. Can it be expected that people who are on the verge of starvation will sit down quietly when they know that men like Rockefeller are day by day delving into their pockets and taking from them money which they can so ill afford to spare? I well remember what the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) said when the then Prime Minister (Mr. Andrew Fisher) introduced his first Income Tax and Probate Bill. The Acting Prime Minister, who was then a freelance, said he knew that a large number of people would be called upon to pay the tax because, and he added, 'There is going on in every community a nitration process, and this impost will filter down and down until it reaches bedrock,' Bedrock, he added, was represented by the working people of this country, who, because they could not pass it on, would have to carry the burden. Not only are the people being charged exorbitant rates for food, clothing, and on every article in everyday use, but they know they have to pay the rich man's taxes as well. With this galling fact staring them in the face, are they going to sit down quietly. Can it be expected that they will be amiable when they know that this robbery is. going on? I say that unless some redress is given, not only shall we hear the stamping of the feet and the shouting of voices, but I fear something worse will happen in this country."
"KEV","It is a wilful waste of money to allow these people to air their fads on the best paper, procurable. I admit that in the matter of departmental usage of paper the Postmaster-General has gone to the other extreme. The telegrams issued by his Department are so difficult to open, owing to the shocking quality of the paper, that they are a disgrace to the Department. At the other end of the scale, however, the wilful waste perpetrated by an institution which professes to do a great deal in behalf of industry amounts to a scandalous shame. The Public Accounts Committee, in a recently- submitted report, indicated to the Government where they already possess suitable sites for buildings for branches of the Public Service. Witness what Has happened recently, however. The Repatriation Department notified that it had outgrown its East Melbourne quarters - that its requirements were about 40,000 square feet of space. The Commonwealth Property Officer was requested to endeavour to secure a suitable position. He made investigations, and recommended that if the Repatriation Department required land with buildings on it, it was believed that, with the consent of the Governor-General, an area could be obtained in the neighbourhood of the Young Men's Christian Association Rest Hut. It appears that finally the Federal Government agreed to lease from the Victorian Government, for a period of twenty-one years, the site on St. Kilda-road recently occupied by Hoadley's Chocolate Factory. It is intended to pay the interest on the sum with which the State Government purchased that site - an item amounting to £400 per annum. That may be regarded by certain people as a mere bagatelle. But it is when such comparatively small amounts are heaped on each other that a huge aggregate is discovered. Why is that particular site required? There is land available in the Victoria Barracks yard which should amply serve the requirements of the Repatriation Department. There is also a large area at present carrying only some old iron buildings, at the corner of St. Kilda-road and Wadey-street, at the northern end of the Barracks block. It is occupied now by the Victorian police. It has an area of, approximately, 84,000 square feet, with a frontage of 135 feet to St. Kilda-road, 458 feet to Wadey-street. and 198 feet to Wells-street. The report of the Accounts Committee points out that if a building were to be erected on that land it would not be architecturally necessary to conform to the style of the existing Barracks, which are built of bluestone. If the Government are keen upon improving a property at all, why should they not improve their own? It appears, however, that they prefer to go further afield, and to construct temporary buildings on the Hoadley site, for which block they are to pay an item of interest amounting to £400 per annum. Further, there is the prospect at any time that they may have to quit that property and be forced to seek shelter elsewhere. One might multiply instances of public money being utterly wasted. So far as I am concerned, if any word or influence of mine can save even £10 for the public purse, I shall deem it worth my while."
"KEV","The conditions on the sugar plantations of Java and other places are deplorable, a good number being, I believe, under Dutch control, and the native labour employed under what is almost a system of slavery, or semi-slavery. The same may be said, unfortunately, of Fiji, and in this regard the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a good deal to blame. The conditions there are a danger to our civilization; and I believe they must have been largely brought about by the consent of the British Government. Fiji is only a Crown colony, and I cannot imagine that the importation of tens of thousands of Indian coolies could have been effected without the knowledge and sanction of the British Government. An official report by one who has visited the sugar-fields of Fiji, and a report from a representative of the Indian Government, are such a slashing condemnation of the operations of this company, and of others, that I feel sure the British Government, or some other Government, will, in consequence, make somebody 'sit up.' Since the war terminated not only trade unionists and working people generally are asking for protection in England. I saw in the Times a great page advertisement, calling on the middle classes to form one great union, and there is a provisional executive, including many members of the House of Commons. The object is to have some organization by means of which the voice of the middle classes may be heard in. the efforts to solve some of the problems which confront the Old Country, and to safeguard them from being made the dupes and victims of profiteers. There is the same need in Australia for some such action, and, although I am a member of the Labour party, I believe that if I were to convene a meeting of those who call themselves the middle classes - though it might be difficult to define them - the attendance would be overflowing. Mr. Knibbs can work out his figures to the nicest fraction, but any intelligent house-wife will tell you what a difference there is between her bills five or six years ago and her bills to-day in the matter of groceries, clothing, and so forth. Indeed, it is a marvel to me how many in this community manage to live. The other night I was addressing a meeting, and mentioned, that so far as I could make out, £1 in 1910 would purchase as much as £1 13s. 10d. will to-day, and an interjector called out that the difference was really much greater. After the meeting the man who had interjected told me that, employed on the wheat stacks, he earned SA. 7s. a week, and that after providing for rent, union dues, and for his wife and six children, there was so little left that he could not afford to buy a decent suit in which to attend his union meetings. I could not disbelieve the man; and if that is the case with a wage of £4 7s., what must be the conditions in homes where the average earnings are £2 10s. to £3, and where the families are equally large, or larger. In my own electorate I find the streets where the working classes live full of youngsters, whereas in the more 'toffy' parts hardly a child can be seen playing about. The working men are the greatest producers in the country in more senses than one, and they provide that great essential, human beings. I know the electors of Dalley, for I lived there as far back as 1886; and I do not wonder at the honorable member (Mr. Mahony) pleading for the women and children who are suffering from hunger. Can we be surprised at the honorable member bursting the bounds of ordinary decorum, and smashing into smithereens the rules of this or any other House, when he thinks of the awful distress that prevails in that industrial centre. The Government must be held distinctly criminal if they allow the present state of things to continue, seeing that it can be so easily prevented. What is the good of the Government providing £1,000 to be doled out in relief? Our people do not want doles; they have proved their independence on the battle-field and on the cricket and football fields, and, manly and womanly as they are, they hate such parity. What they demand is work to exercise their muscles and brain, so that they may increase the wealth of the country, and enable us to meet the present financial position. Starvation and unemployment never did any country any good. Have we no national spirit or spirit of humanity? In Great Britain, even in the university arena, it is being realized that something must be done. But university appointments will not create bread, aud it is work and bread that are wanted now. The working people have made this country what it is, and they and their children ought to have a chance. With vigorous men and women, well fed and well clothed, Australia has a great future. Our agricultural areas are a mere nothing compared with the value of human souls; let us in all our legislation do that which will bring some relief to the sufferers in our community. I wish to see Australia living under peaceful and well-ordered government; but unless something is done we shall be in danger of happenings for which we shall be sorry, aud it is the duty of the Government to provide work and food for the people. Debate (on motion by Mr. Sinclair) adjourned."
"N/A","Freeman Case: Mr. Corbould: Doctor on s.s. 'Sonoma.'"
"KEA","That may be so, and he is probably laughing heartily now, and may laugh heartily when he reads my remarks. But it is a very dangerous laugh that would cause the feeling there was in Sydney at that time. There was a great deal of public sympathy for a man who 'was starving and on the verge of collapse' which Freeman could not have been if he was taking water. That fact seems to be well established. The doctor of the vessel seems to have done his best to cheat public sympathy, and I would like the Acting Attorney-General to see whether his behaviour brings him within the compass of the laws of the Commonwealth. Question resolved in the affirmative."
