"CT4","That is tomorrow's allegation, is it? Can I make it clear what is important in relation to Australia as we confront this external challenge—a challenge which Australia has not had to confront in the last couple of decades. All the time during the last couple of decades, regardless of what was happening in the Australian economy, Asia was an impetus to growth. Even when Labor had the Australian economy in recession in 1990, 1991 and 1992, Asia was still a stimulus.","17"
"CT4","This is the first time in the last two decades that Asia will not be a stimulus to the Australian economy. What that means is that we have to work as hard as ever to secure the Australian economic situation. The first thing we have to do is deliver on our historic commitment to take the Australian budget out of the red and put it back into the black. This is a very important part of an economic strategy to face the emerging crisis. That means that all of the unfunded promises that are now being made in the name of the Australian Labor Party are utterly irresponsible in the face of an external challenge of the dimension that we are facing. Every day the Leader of the Opposition walks into parliament, he makes another unfunded promise. It is almost as if there is a bit of magic when he goes through those doors. He talked this morning as he came in about $1.7 billion in relation to health: 'Whipping $1.7 billion out is basically taking it out of the states one way or another, so they certainly need that put back with an appropriate set of terms.' That is what he said this morning. He made a $1.7 billion unfunded promise just this morning, which you can put together with all of his other unfunded promises in relation to foreign aid, in relation to nursing homes, in relation to R&D syndicates and in relation to all of the tax dodgers. All of these are unfunded promises which would be utterly irresponsible in the face of the current situation. What else does Australia need to do in the face of the current situation? Let me make this point. For an island nation whose exports go out through ports and wharfs nothing could be more damaging to the Australian economy than a sclerotic waterfront that has restrictive work practices and that operates in an unproductive way. What do we see? The Australian Labor Party would choke the lifeblood of the Australian economy because it will not support reform on Australia's waterfront. Nothing could be more irresponsible than for the Labor Party to give comfort to those who want to make Australia uncompetitive. The Labor Party should join this government to support waterfront reform. What else do we need to do in the face of the external challenge? In the face of the external challenge nothing could be more important to Australia than tax reform. Why would we sit back complacently like the Australian Labor Party and say that we will imbed indirect taxes into our exports at a time when our exports are struggling on world markets? What could be more complacent than that? Yet the Australian Labor Party say there is no need to reform our taxation system. They say there is no need to take the fundamental restructuring which is required in Australia to get the Australian economy going again.","17"

"7T4","On a point of order, Mr Speaker","17"
"BT4","I thank the member for Prospect for her question. I have read the letter from Sister Mary-Louise. I have also had Sister Mary-Louise's views conveyed to me by the member for Lindsay. Sister Mary-Louise has provided good services to unemployed people in the electorate of Lindsay for a long time. I am naturally sympathetic to Sister Mary-Louise because in the end the bid that she did submit was not competitive compared with those that were accepted for that area.","17"
"BT4","In the letter there were a number of factual inaccuracies. I am happy to put the facts on the record for Sister Mary-Louise in relation to the increasing assistance which unemployed people will be getting in St Marys. First of all, unemployed people will have access to the services of Mission Australia in St Marys, which will be able to assist hundreds of long-term unemployed people to get jobs in a way which will be tailored to their individual needs.","17"
"BT4","Our responsibility in the end is to the unemployed people of this country. Our responsibility is to help in the best possible way that we can those people who are most disadvantaged. It is no criticism of someone who has been offering services for a long time to say that the government has received a better plan to help unemployed people in that area. In addition to that the government has contracted other providers within the general St Marys area who will be assisting over 2,000 unemployed people. Anyone who is unemployed in St Marys will be able to go to those other providers as well. So they will have for the first time a choice of a number of agencies to provide them with help in filling job vacancies.","17"
"BT4","Let me return to the point that I made before. If all we are going to hear from the Labor Party are the views of those who have not got contracts in this tender round—a very high quality tender round with lots of excellent proposals—all it will do is underline to the people of Australia that the Labor Party has no constructive plan whatever to help unemployed people. The only people in this country who are putting forward a creative, innovative, soundly based plan to help the unemployed people in this country are the coalition. You are a policy vacuum. When you were the Leader of the House, you added 95,000 to the ranks of the long-term unemployed. You failed as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. You are failing as the Leader of the Opposition. It is up to the coalition to put forward these constructive people to help people in this country.","17"

"ZD4","I have already answered the question raised in relation to married women. Let me make it very clear to the House that the difference between our approach and your approach is that we are offering the unemployed hope and choice. They are two things that you never offered them, because when you were in government you drove unemployment to a post-Depression high. The bloke who now leads your party, the Leader of the Opposition, presided over an unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent. That is the worst unemployment rate that Australia has had since the Great Depression. The same Leader of the Opposition presided over a youth unemployment rate of 32 per cent. All that those opposite can do","17"

"ZD4","I answered it very specifically yesterday. It is perfectly obvious that all the Labor Party wants to do on this new plan is whinge and carp. I will finish on this note. It is a very interesting piece of double standard on the part of the opposition. When it comes to the Natural Heritage Trust, it is wrong for","17"
"8E4","The honourable member should be aware that, on about 12 October, the Australian Medical Association started what effectively is industrial action in the Hunter in an attempt to increase GP rebates, so if there was any effect on this you would expect to see it in the December quarter figures from last year, which are the last quarterly figures we have.","17"
"8E4","There are 680 general practitioners who live in the Hunter region, with 220 in Newcastle. Of the 680 GPs who live in the Hunter region, it is true that 12 do not bulk-bill at all—eight part-time and four full-time GPs. The rest bulk-bill some or all patients.","17"
"8E4","The second point that was made on the Today Tonight show related to the incomes of GPs. Dr Mellows said that 'if you look at the average income of GPs, which is reported to be $42,000 a year, you would wonder why people do medicine'. If that were true you would wonder why people would do medicine. I also took out the aggregated figures on incomes for doctors in Newcastle. Some 10 per cent of GPs in Newcastle last year received billings of between $250,000 and $320,000-that is before practice payments of $13,000 to $42,000 a practice, before above schedule fees, before work cover, before medico-legal and before any sessional fees. Far from having an average income of $42,000, general practitioners do rather well. I admit that this is before practice costs, but even after practice costs it is still a very substantial income. I will make a few points on this. I do not mind people earning a high income. The overwhelming majority of doctors are hard working and they work for their money. I do not blame Today Tonight for being duped by a small number of doctors. But it appears that what has happened in this case is that a handful of GPs in Newcastle have got together, decided to take this action and sought media attention for their plight. If this is true, it may constitute collusive behaviour in breach of section 45 of the Trade Practices Act, and I have decided to refer the matter to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, with a request that it be investigated and, if necessary, that action be taken. I make a final point. I have some sympathy with general practitioners in that their rebates have not gone up in the last five years as much as for other doctors. This is because of a decision taken in 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was then Minister for Finance, to half index GP rebates across the forward estimates and in perpetuity. The net effect of this decision has been to take $1.25 per consultation off general practitioner incomes. Far from bleating that you can hardly find a doctor who bulk-bills, the Leader of the Opposition should examine his own motives and realise that it was his decision that has reduced GP incomes by $1.25 per consultation.","17"
"CT4","The member for Werriwa is only too well aware of the social security system. I welcome the support of tax reform by the progressive members of the Australian Labor Party.","17"
"CT4","It is not true that all of the members of the Australian Labor Party are as illiterate on matters of tax as the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition. If you take a family with two children aged seven and four and both parents unemployed and one of the parents goes into the work force and gets a job paying $200 per week, the effect of income tax plus clawback of social security benefits will mean that, out of the $200 they earn a week, that person will receive only $64—an effective marginal tax rate of around 70 per cent of what they actually earn. If they went to get a job getting an additional $150 per week, the take home pay would increase only by $24 a week; that is, they would lose nearly $130 out of the $150 that they earned by going into the work force. Clearly, what this is saying is that the interaction of the income tax system and the social security system is impacting very unfairly on average taxpayers. That is why this government wants to improve the tax system. We think that the tax system is unfair. We cannot understand why the Australian Labor Party defends such an unfair system, why the Australian Labor Party will not join with us and say, 'Taxation reform is necessary in Australia.' We cannot understand why, after 13 years, the Australian Labor Party did nothing about it and, now that they are in opposition again, why they will not join the government in favour of tax reform. There is one side of Australian politics that wants to improve the tax system—one side of Australian politics that wants to make it fairer.","17"
"ZD4","I should be so lucky. In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I have seen a newspaper report, presumably the one that you quoted from. I have not personally had a discussion with Senator Gibson, but let me make it very clear that we, as a coalition in government, are prepared—unlike you—to have a go at reforming Australia's old-fashioned, out-of-date taxation system. We are prepared to have a go. The Liberal and National parties are prepared to put a political commitment down to really try to fix the Australian taxation system. Can I tell you what the Australian people are telling us. If you cared to listen, they would be telling you exactly the same thing. They think the present system is unfair. They want the present system changed and, provided what comes out of the change is in aggregate a fair alternative to the present system, they will embrace it. I laid down five principles when I announced in August last year that we would be going to the next election with an alternative taxation program. This is the crowd that had 13 long years","17"
"ZD4","I was asked a question about the taxation reform designs of my government. I am answering that question by reminding the Australian people that we have the political courage to try to improve an unfair system—Labor does not. We have the political commitment to provide relief to ordinary Australian families—Labor does not. We do not have the track record of having told the Australian people in 1993 that we were against higher levels of indirect tax and then, immediately on getting re-elected on that false promise, jacking up every indirect tax in the country. We are not the party that ran around promising l-a-w tax cuts and then repudiating them.","17"
"ZD4","I want to remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that five principles were laid down when I announced that we were going to have tax reform. I can assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that when our plan is unveiled all of those principles will be met. All I can say to those opposite is: ask me more questions. Ask me questions every day about taxation reform. Every time you ask me a question, it gives me the opportunity to tell the Australian people that we are in favour of having a go at fixing the taxation system and that you are against it.","17"

"PE4","Mr Speaker, on a point of order","17"
"WI4","I think all members of the House would be interested to know that the basis of the industrial action being taken by the MUA tomorrow is to take all the rorts and the rip-offs which they today get by allowance and overtime and put all those into a base salary. On top of that, they have got the hide and the greed to ask for a pay increase of $4,500 a year. This is a claim based on greed and vengeance by the MUA which is being supported by none other than the Labor Party. For years, they were responsible for the rorts and the rip-offs on the Australian waterfront, which is one of the contributors to Australia's foreign debt because of its inability to efficiently move goods across the Australian waterfront. Now, by their silence, the Labor Party are sitting, applauding and endorsing the MUA and their campaign of greed and their campaign to maintain the rorts and the rip-offs which are so evident on the Australian waterfront. The wharfies are asking for an extra $90 a week at a cost to the employer of approximately $130 a week per employee. That will add an extra $22½ million to the cost of stevedoring operations in Australia, which is, in effect, another tax being imposed by the MUA on all those goods which go across the Australian waterfront. It is an outrage that this weak Leader of the Opposition, in the face of a guerilla campaign by his mates, is simply incapable of at least showing the leadership to stand up to these people. There is no doubt that the example of the crane driver who is on $90,000 a year but sits on his crane for only 14 hours a week is really starting to hit home. Yesterday, I received a letter from a wharfie in Brisbane. He said: I am truly getting sick of listening and reading about how much we earn for the year and the 14½ hours that I and my colleagues operate the crane and that we earn $90,000. He then set out to correct me. He said that, for the year ending 30 June 1997, he earned $80,414. In the year before, he only earned the average $74,000. Now his mates back in Sydney, with the support of the Labor Party, are asking for another $4,500. In response to the member's question, I can tell him that the average wharfie is on about $74,000 a year and you are lucky to get 30 hours a week out of them in any average week. As a comparison, nurses and policemen—who really do put in for the community—earn something like half that amount. It is a continuing testament to the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition because he is yet to condemn the guerrilla and thuggish tactics of the MUA.","17"
"WI4","I am aware of this closure and the general circumstances, and I understand it is in the member's electorate. Let me say on behalf of the government that, where employers fail to meet their entitlements, the employees are certainly entitled to take action. The Office of the Employment Advocate is available to those employees, as it is to any employees who have been dudded by their employer.","17"
"BT4","I thank the member for Cowan for his question. I know that he is dedicated to expanding apprenticeship opportunities for young people. He himself left school, I think, at 16 to take up an apprenticeship, and many like him have gained a wonderful start to their careers through apprenticeships. Unfortunately, the message that the Labor Party gave young people in this country was that it was all right to drop out of school and live on the dole. This government has made a major commitment to the 70 per cent of school leavers who are not going on to university, and we have put the resources into backing that commitment—$187 million over four years. In fact, during the first term of this government, we put four times as much money into supporting vocational education opportunities in schools as Labor put in in its entire 13 years of government. As a consequence, in the last year of the Labor Party, there were only some 3,000 students in Australian schools actually undertaking industry endorsed programs of vocational education. In 1997, as a result of this government's policy, there were 38,000 students in schools—a 12 times increase. We put our money where our mouth is. In 1996-97, there were some 98,000 commencements in new apprenticeships, and I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that this year the government will more than exceed its promise to create 100,000 new apprenticeships. This is a wonderful opportunity for young Australians with a commonsense, down-to-earth, practical policy that provides them with opportunities. The only regret we have is that, while everyone in Australia is pleased with this, there is one group who is not that is, the Australian Labor Party. The member for Werriwa said on ABC radio in South Australia on 15 October last year: I really fear, particularly under this federal government, that the balance is tipping away towards the vocational end. Make no mistake: the member for Werriwa has let the cat out of the bag. If Labor gets back into office, it will take away these apprenticeships and it will cut opportunities for the 70 per cent not going on to university. Labor tried to kill the apprenticeship system when it was in office in favour of the schemes favoured by its union mates, and it will try to do it again.","17"
"WI4","He is claiming it is. I honestly have no information whatsoever. But I can say that one of the tasks of the Office of the Employment Advocate is to ensure that the freedom of association provisions of the federal law are observed, and the advocate has been very active in pursuing instances and examples where unions have required people to be members of a union.","17"
"WI4","We had a recent example of this down at Webb Dock where a non-union truck driver attempted to enter the Patrick property. He was prevented by some of your mates from the TWU, and a complaint was lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate that very day. By the end of the day, a non-union truck driver and other persons, regardless of whether or not they were members of a union, were able to access that site. The fact of the matter is that we have a very strong ban on compulsory unionism. The advocate is doing an absolutely excellent job. If you have genuine concerns, instead of making political points, you ought to raise them with me.","17"
"7V5","The confidential document to which the member for Grey refers is, of course, the one that was used by Senator Bolkus at a press conference on Monday, 5 January. That document is one to which access could be given only by a Federal Court order, and the court has informed the government that no such order had been sought or made. Yesterday I pointed out that the Leader of the Opposition's defence of Senator Bolkus using the document—namely, that Senator Vanstone leaked the affidavit—was quite wrong. Yesterday I also pointed out that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's defence of Senator Bolkus—namely, that the material leaked was already in the Daily Telegraph article of Monday, 5 January—was also quite wrong. Let us have a look at what Senator Bolkus says in his own defence. On the 7.30 Report last week Senator Bolkus said that the document was with the media. However, no evidence was offered. Senator Bolkus asserted last week through a spokesman that the document was on the public record and that he regarded it as being in the public domain. There does not seem to be any evidence of that either. The Telegraph article did not refer to the affidavit. At his press conference, which was after the article had appeared, Senator Bolkus read from it. But if the affidavit was already in the media, why did he then say that he could not give it out and he would proceed to read from it off the record? It cannot be mere coincidence that copies of the two pages from which he read and the two passages to which he referred and which were underlined","17"
"RH4","Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Given the ruling you just made, I would also draw your attention to the request","17"
"8E4","I thank the honourable member for his question. In the same speech that the Leader of the Opposition made last night, where he was using Today Tonight as his personal research department, he also made claims that the government had taken $1.7 billion from public health, whatever 'public health' means. He amplified that on radio this morning when he somehow defined the fiscal contribution that states have made to the Commonwealth's budget deficit reduction task as public health, which only shows that the Leader of the Opposition has no understanding of how the hospitals run, or no understanding of how financial assistance grants run. The simple fact is that this was made on a voluntary basis by the states as a contribution of $320 million a year. It has nothing to do with public health. It really only shows your foolishness and your buffoonery, and the fact that you are prepared to say or do anything to achieve an end, no matter how false it is.","17"
"8E4","The reason the states were giving this fiscal contribution was that the former Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition, left a $10½ billion deficit that they were prepared to help us address. The second point that the Leader of the Opposition somehow claimed was related to public health was the Commonwealth dental program, announced in the dying days of the 1993 election campaign by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, as a four-year program. Six months early, when the number of claimed or promised cases had been treated, we met the original promise made in the dying days of the 1993 election. We did not keep it going when you, yourself, had not made any promise to keep it going. The third point is that the Leader of the Opposition claims that the PBS is somehow taking from public health programs. This year we are spending $235 million more on the PBS than we did last year, and last year we spent $211 million more than we did in the year before.","17"
"8E4","What we have simply done in the PBS is reorder our priorities for which we make no apologies. We have reordered our priorities to fund higher cost newer drugs. We have reordered our priorities to make sure that these are available in a timely manner rather than merely funding 'me too' drugs. The Leader of the Opposition attempts to claim that we have somehow cut $1.7 billion from health; his figures do not stack up. To note that a fiscal contribution could somehow be taken from public hospitals simply shows he does not have a clue how they work.","17"
"ZD4","That is not a bad achievement; that is a very considerable achievement.","17"
"ZD4","The member for Hotham is engaging in that age old Labor Party tactic: you talk gloom and doom. You talk the Australian economy down. He invites me to talk about employment. I will talk about employment: employment has risen by 145,000 in the last four months. I will talk about investment: business investment in Australia is running at record levels. I will talk about inflation: inflation in Australia is the lowest of any country in the OECD. I will talk about rate of economic growth: our rate of economic growth is equal to or better than any member country of the G7. Let me warm to the task. Let me talk about interest rates.","17"
"WI4","Mr Speaker","2","3","12","17","18"
"3K6","Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to the question of relevance. You cannot on the one hand ask a question which is wide-ranging, has a lengthy introductory statement and invites debate and then complain about lack of relevance and specificity in the minister's response.","17"
"ZD4","Of course it is relevant. Having dealt with employment, having dealt with investment, having dealt with inflation, having dealt with growth, let me deal with interest rates. In just over two years, interest rates have fallen by the equivalent of $300 a month for the average home buyer in Australia. I know that nobody opposite likes to be reminded of this, but that is the equivalent of a wage rise of $100 a week for the average worker. $100 a week for the average worker.","17"
"ZD4","As a result of that, the great majority of the Australian people are simply not going to listen to this talking down of the Australian economy. They are not going to listen to this doomsday talk from those who sit opposite. They are going to recognise quality economic management when they see it.","17"
"DT4","Thank you.","12","18"
"10000","The honourable member for Hotham will bask in his affected glory but silently.","17"
"GT4","Another very important point is that this announcement fulfils yet another coalition election promise to deliver faster anti-dumping mechanisms. I have been interested in the interjections from the honourable member for Hotham. He has been running around the countryside telling us how slow and ineffective the current mechanisms are. Senator Murphy has been echoing that as well. In the Advocate he described the process as too slow, repetitive and inefficient. Let me remind the House who introduced these proposals. It was those opposite. The Labor Party introduced this slow, cumbersome system that they are now so vigorous in criticising.","17"
"GT4","Not only did they introduce the system, but when they were in government they said it could not be done any faster or any better. The honourable member for Hotham said in the House of Representatives on 25 November 1992, `One cannot magically shorten the anti-dumping period and expect to have better anti-dumping provisions.' In government they could not do it any faster. We will deliver faster results.","17"

"PG6","My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Does the Minister for Family Services stand by his statement in the House yesterday where he said:","17"
"PG6","'Accommodation charges go to capital upgrading . . . the daily fees go directly to nursing homes.' Is it not a fact that not one extra dollar of the $133 million raised by the extra daily fee will go to increasing nursing home budgets?","17"
"GJ4","I do stand by what I said yesterday. Accommodation charges that are raised go to capital upgrades. Daily fees that are paid by residents go to the care needs of those residents and those funds go to the hands of the providers. That is the factual situation. What you are trying to do","17"
"WI4","I sincerely thank the member for Moreton for his question because today we could not get one from the other side on waterfront. Where is my Kylie Minoguer? The Prime Minister got one and the Treasurer got one. These guys are so politically embarrassed about the waterfront and their own defence of the indefensible that they cannot even muster the political courage to stand up here and ask me just one question about the waterfront. So I do sincerely thank the member for his question. The industrial action that we are about to see in Sydney is the culmination of years of failure by the previous Labor government which has led to the circumstance today where Australia's exporters, Australia's farmers, those people who rely on the $120 billion worth of goods going across the Australian waterfront are unable to obtain an efficient and reliable service on the Australian waterfront. You can trace it all the way back to the time when the Leader of the Opposition was the senior member of the then Labor government. They had a report done on the waterfront. The advice to the government was at page 31, volume 1, of the report by the Interstate Commission entitled Waterfront Investigation Conclusions and Recommendations. It stated: Although there was general agreement that the number of waterfront unions should be reduced, more concern was expressed in the second round about possible abuses of power by a single maritime union. In other words, they were told nearly 10 years ago, back in 1989, that if we are to have an efficient waterfront and if we are to do away with the rorts, inefficiencies and the industrial action 10 times the national average then we would have to have a more competitive system on the Australian waterfront. If we were to do something about Australia's foreign debt these guys would have needed to have the courage to stand up to the thuggery of the MUA and require a far more efficient waterfront. They failed to do so for years and today they do not even have the guts to stand up and ask a simple question about the state of the waterfront. It is no wonder, given those inefficiency. For example, the rort of the day is that of the three man lashing team. It is a variation on the Three Musketeers motto `All for one and one for all.' Except in the wharfies case for the lashing team it is `One sick, all sick at full pay.' One sick and they all go out. This is what you think is admirable about the Australian waterfront. This is why you are embarrassed to ask questions. You do not even have what it takes in your own tactics committee to say, `Listen guys, it's about time we finally had a position which is somehow distant from the MUA.' You are bound hand and foot. You must be the weakest Leader of the Labor Party we have seen in 30 years. It is absolutely pathetic. The Labor Party are the architects of the circumstance on the Australian waterfront. Not only was WIRA a failure, but its failure is evident on the waterfront today. I will give you two examples. The first is the rorts and rip-offs that we have seen for years. The second is that after they forked out $420 million to wharfies to become redundant, we now find that in the Patricks organisation alone there are 290 wharfies, who are classified as casual, who were actually paid out in the WIRA process. They were paid out $80,000 to $90,000 plus superannuation. Those in the Patricks organisation were paid out $25 million to $29 million to get rid of them and they are still there, in this particular case, earning $30,000 to $40,000 a year as casuals. This is the legacy of Labor's ties to the trade union movement. You are still bound hand and foot to them and it is testimony to your chronic weakness.","17"

"10000","So have many members and so do many members I think that, within limits, that is legitimate. It is permitted only in very restricted circumstances. It was not a newspaper; it was a graph. There is a considerable difference between a graph and a newspaper. If people wish to display graphs, that is altogether different from displaying a newspaper.","17"
"PG6","Terry Sweetman continues: . . . they've raised their families, they've lost their loved ones, and now they're old and still they haven't paid enough. That is what this government is saying. That is it in a nutshell: 'You haven't paid enough. It doesn't matter that you are sick and old and need to go into a nursing home. It doesn't matter that the only asset you have, your home, will have to be used to pay the annual fees.' The icing on the cake is this extra tax that started on 1 March this year that will see the government raise $133 million, not one cent of which will go to improve the lot of people in nursing homes. There will not be one extra nurse employed. The food will not improve. The buildings will not improve. Nothing will improve as a result of this extra tax. It all goes to the government's bottom line. It is time the government abolished this fee and gave people who need nursing home care the care they deserve.","17"
"GJ4","The money that is paid by someone coming into a residence where they are making a self-contribution is paid to the person sitting at the front desk, and the money goes to the contribution of the care that person receives: all their food, their bedding, and so on. That is where the money actually goes. What she is trying to get at and I guess I have got to help her; the deputy leader gave her advice before the MPI, having had two days of questions without having got it quite right is this: the money that is paid by those who are making a contribution towards their care, in addition to what they receive from the Commonwealth government which, as I mentioned, is over $3 billion a year, changes the extent of the taxpayer contribution to the overall provision of these services. These funds are estimated to be, over the four years, about $81 million-odd. I think that is an equitable contribution to ask them to make. I go back to the accommodation charges. As those accommodation charges flow into the system over that four-year period, they will generate about $505 million. But remember the point that I made: 65 per cent of those people who are in those residences are full pensioners. The Commonwealth makes what is known as a concessional payment for those people. We make a direct payment to those people whose assets are below $22,500, to a maximum of $12 per day, using a formula. The contribution that the Commonwealth will make over that four-year period means that the total amount that will be applied for capital upgrade is about $850 million. So, when you take into account self-contribution by accommodation charge and the amount that the Commonwealth pays by way of concessional contribution over the four-year period remembering that 65 per cent are full pensioners we will make about an $850 million contribution to that capital. That is very significant. The opposition choose to ignore that. They have committed themselves to a political path on this matter. We are all in politics, but we also have a higher commitment, in my view, to cater for the needs of the next generation. My colleagues who are in the House know that we have to make some decisions about the needs of the next generation. Why should we be ticking everything up on the bankcard, mortgaging their future? People are entering higher quality nursing homes because of the actions that we are taking. We are asking them to make a contribution to their care by way of daily fees and to capital needs by way of an accommodation charge. It is being done under rules and arrangements that progressively are being understood. As we progressively take this information to the community, all we have to deal with is the obstruction and the misinformation primarily generated by the opposition. The shadow minister quoted some of the church groups. I am in consultation with the church groups. There will always be differences of opinion. But people ought to recognise that the church groups in this country have large reserves too. Maybe they ought to be doing just a little bit more in applying some of those reserves, I say to them in passing. It would be an interesting exercise in itself to see what level of contribution they would make. The days of going to the taxpayer as the sole, complete and total funder to meet demographic needs and population shifts will come to an end. It will not matter whether we are in government or you are in government, you will have to face this issue. That is why it is so interesting that in Hobart at the ALP national convention there were no discussions about the future policy prescription for your party. The Labor Party knows that these issues have to be faced. There are differing views within the Labor Party, we know, about how this can be done. But going back to the old Socialist Left approach, the taxpayer pays all approach where those who can make an equitable contribution have a free ride at the expense of pensioners is, I think, an absolute affront to equity and fair dealing for those people who will come next. Finally, I want to quote from the transcript of a radio program in Perth on 26 February, because I think it is quite interesting. It was the Howard Sattler program. Ms Macklin, the shadow minister, was on that program. At the end of it, we had the usual misinformation and distortion and a little bit of the emotion that we saw again today. As I said at the beginning, the extent of the interjections indicates the political nature of the approach that the Labor Party has decided to take on this matter. The announcer asked for call-ins, and somebody called Nell called in. She said: . . . your shadow minister is telling a lot of half truths. Then, in answer to a contribution from the announcer, Mr Sattler, she said: But the thing is that, by telling those half truths over radio, she is petrifying the elderly people. I think that is unforgivable. Petrifying elderly people is not","17"

"SK6","Your particular contribution to this debate did not contain particulars. I was waiting for the particulars to support your argument. I was patiently waiting to hear what you were saying that was supporting it, but I waited in vain. All I got was a continual assessment that somehow or other the government is moving in this direction because it has some agenda designed to hidebound the Solicitor-General, designed to make him a prisoner of the Attorney-General and of the government in some way. I waited in vain to hear that; we did not get it. The temptation in politics is to make these arguments full of sound and fury. The honourable member would perhaps remember something I said some time ago, that when you have really got nothing to say in an argument then do it loudly, do it aggressively, do it full of sound and fury and avoid really talking about particularity. That is the problem with the position that the honourable member for Banks takes on this issue. It is loud, it is entertaining and it is interesting, but it lacks substance. I enjoyed the honourable member's speech, but I really thought I was a member of a jury down in Bankstown or somewhere or other where they sit in the county courts in New South Wales listening to another contribution from the honourable member for Banks. On a more serious note, it is important to touch a little on this notion of independence. It is important for law officers of the Crown to have that sort of independence that ultimately is part of acting in the task without being circumscribed, except to the extent that instructions are given by the government and there is nothing wrong with the government giving instructions to the Solicitor-General who is appearing in a case. He does not go down there and make up his own instructions, as we used to like to do when we were in the profession, but we could not do. We probably would have won more cases if we could have made up our instructions. The fact of the matter is he acts on instructions like any other ordinary barrister from the bottom right to the top. However, also in his role as a very senior lawyer he is not going to just meekly and lame-duckly wander down and raise no objection on any particular matter that he is asked to make submissions on. Like any barrister, obviously discussions are had. No barrister worth his salt would lamely go down and accept what he was told, unless it is a situation of such great importance to the government of the day that he is told to act in that way where it is necessary to submit on a particular point. However, I am sure he would do so after considering all of the arguments in the case and strongly submitting those arguments before going down. The importance of independence was raised. The honourable member for Banks raised a number of matters here. I think independence is very important in the legal profession, in the judiciary in particular and in the numerous tribunals around the country. I do not think anyone would argue otherwise. The Solicitor-General's professionalism is never going to be questioned because the people who will be asked to do this job, the people to whom the job will be offered, the people who will be called upon from time to time to be appointed to this position, will be the top men and women around the country. It is important to strip away some of the rhetoric but at the same time to try to inject some balance, to try to look at the points objectively and to ultimately consider that the context of this matter is the wider review of the officer's total remuneration package, including consideration by the Remuneration Tribunal whether there should be an increase in the salary payable to the Solicitor-General in the light of the earnings of members of the private bar. The bill does amend the principal act to remove the current entitlement for a judge's pension and payment in lieu of unused long leave in respect of future appointments to the office of Solicitor-General. In other words, it is an important measure, which my electorate of Dickson applauds because, as I have said before, it is always asking me what the government is doing to ensure that there is not a double-dipping situation or that these sorts of offices are not used as sinecures or that the officers are not in other ways paid too generously to fulfil these offices in light of all of the circumstances prevailing in today's legal world. So at the end of the day I am very happy to support this measure. I ask the honourable member for Banks to remember when looking at this legislation that the principal act was brought in in 1964 and we are now in 1998. I think it is about time that we look at all those sorts of things when we combine an appreciation of the current legal environment as well as the environment as far as the electorate is concerned the cost to the people of Australia for some of these very generous schemes that are in existence. So at the end of the day I support these measures and commend them to the House.","17"

"0K6","The debate on Sydney's airport needs continues to arouse a lot of heat. Last December the EIS on Badgerys Creek was released, and then in January the auditor's report was produced by SMEC. Needless to say, those two reports have generated a considerable reaction within the local community, and I am sure the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) would agree with that. The pent-up anxiety of local residents was released in a flood after the release of those documents. Some of that was really rather exaggerated, but a lot of those concerns were very well founded and quite justified. The EIS and the parallel audit show two things very clearly. They show, firstly, that this government has delivered on its promise to conduct a fully transparent EIS, and that is in stark contrast to the policies of the Labor Party. Before the last election, the then Labor government was not even going to offer an EIS until the coalition promised it would do an EIS and then, kicking and screaming, Labor promised that they would finally come on board and conduct an EIS as well. The parallel audit process on this EIS was the first time in Australia that any government has commissioned an independent parallel audit on an EIS process. It is the first time that that process has been published, that the audit report has been published and opened to further community scrutiny and consultation, and it is the first time that a government has committed itself to taking on board the recommendations of that audit and to then adjust the EIS process according to findings of that audit process an independent, transparent and thorough EIS. The second thing that the EIS and audit process showed is this: it does raise considerable doubts about Badgerys Creek airport. The EIS itself shows that there are problems with aircraft noise, that there are problems with air quality, and there are problems with transport links. Particularly significant were the problems with air quality in western Sydney. The EIS shows that western Sydney is already at maximum levels of ozone and that the construction of an airport there would probably lead to a 25 to 30 per cent increase in ozone levels in western Sydney. Furthermore, the audit process conducted by SMEC shows that there were significant shortcomings in the EIS process and that there was insufficient attention given to the impact on surface drainage system, particularly the Hawkesbury-Nepean system. It showed that waste disposal issues were not adequately covered, that there was a lack of rigour in the economic analysis, and that there was inadequate analysis of the social impact. The pleasing thing is that the minister has committed himself to taking on board those concerns raised by the independent audit. They will be looked at and the EIS process will continue to look at those issues. This again is a sharp contrast to Labor's position. You remember that before the last election the then minister, now the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), said that the Badgerys Creek airport would go ahead regardless of the EIS in other words, we will do an EIS, sure; then we will ignore it and push ahead regardless of what it says, regardless of what the residents want. At least this government has said that we will address the issues raised in the EIS, we will address the issues raised in the audit report and we will then consider it further. The Hobart conference of the Labor Party certainly gave no assurance to the people of western Sydney. In fact, it was a con job pure and simple. It was a two bob each way bet. The Labor Party said, `Sure, we are still committed to having a second airport in the Sydney Basin, but we will not quite say it will be at Badgerys Creek. It will be somewhere else in the Sydney Basin.' It is obvious that the Labor Party was trying to treat the people of western Sydney as fools. If it is not going to be at Badgerys Creek but they still want it in the Sydney Basin, where in the world do they think they are going to put it? That whole process was a cynical exercise by the Labor Party to try to con the people of western Sydney again. The EIS on the Badgerys Creek proposal and the audit report have made it very clear that there are doubts about the Badgerys Creek site. Those doubts are significant enough to have to think again. Those doubts are significant enough to say that Badgerys Creek is not the location for another airport, and to say that we need to look for an alternative. It is simply not fair to the residents of western Sydney to transfer the problems of inner city to the people of the west. It is time to think again.","17"
"MK6","I rise in this adjournment debate to express my concern about the forced closure of the Blacktown skill share office and the alternative steps being put in place by the federal government to provide employment services in my electorate. This skill share office has worked for the people of Blacktown and surrounding areas for 20 years in the task of providing training for our young and not so young unemployed people. The office is now to be reduced to about three people who will only be looking after the JPET program for the next few months. I am concerned about the loss of the talents of the team leader, Roger Mahey, and his team of experienced staff who have performed a great job for the Blacktown community. I am rather surprised at this government's attack on the skillshare organisation. My sources tell me in fact, it has been well reported that many government backbenchers were appreciative of the role played by skillshare in assisting unemployed people with job applications, search and interview skills in their own particular electorates. I know from my own experience of attending graduation ceremonies the tremendous feeling of pride and self-esteem that graduates experience on successfully completing skillshare programs. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) has on a number of occasions expressed strong support for skillshare. The community based board of the Blacktown group, called Work Place, have over the years endured some ups and downs but this recent experience is the most down they have ever endured. For them to be faced with the need to so quickly reduce staff of such quality has been very traumatic for them. The Work Place, in good faith, lodged an application to be part of the new employment program. They have the skills and the obvious expertise and the willingness. More importantly, the office site is centrally situated to perform this service. What they got was no reply. I sent the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) an urgent letter by fax seeking more advice and/or comment to enable the board to make winding up decisions if that was necessary. I did not get an acknowledgment of my letter. The board was therefore required to assume it would wind up its skillshare operation and valuable staff have been given notice to quit in the next couple of weeks. The minister goes on TV lauding his new and wonderful privatised employment service, yet pays little regard to the valuable resources that he has so unceremoniously dumped on the job market. The federal government's new privatised employment services have not got off to a very good start in my electorate, although I admit the information at this stage is very sketchy. The CES people have been reasonably helpful. However, there is no official confirmation as to how the service will operate post privatisation. I am advised that the CES office in Blacktown will close on 28 March and there will only be a limited service provider until 1 May, when Employment National is due to begin. I am further advised that when Employment National does commence at a venue yet to be announced, it will have a staff of five compared to the previous staff of 20. The private providers who have successfully tendered for the Blacktown area Hospitality Horizons, CSA Training Services and Teldraware all still looking for premises in the area. I wish them luck. While I am sure that the Salvation Army, Mission Employment and indeed skillshare, if they had been successful in bidding for the employment program, would do a good job, I am not so sure about the commercial operators. I believe bringing the profit motive into placing unemployed people in jobs will remove the caring aspect and lay the foundation for the scheme to be abused by profit motive operators. Indeed, some of the biggest commercial employment placement firms, including Manpower Australia and Morgan and Banks, said that they would not put in a tender, describing the terms as `uncommercial'. We on this side of the House believe there is going to be an overall drop in the level of assistance to the unemployed. We are concerned about the effect on special groups, in particular disadvantaged job seekers. The debate should be about people and jobs. The bean counters of Treasury should be relegated out of the whole debate. But this mean-spirited government is about money and profit and seems not to have any real feeling for the people they are hurting but are claiming to help.","17"
