"UK6","I move opposition amendment No. 1: Schedule 1, page 3 (line 2) to page 39 (line 11), omit the Schedule, substitute: Schedule 1 - Choice of superanua ion investment sand supranuation funds Part 1 - Superannuation Guarantee ( Administration ) Act 1992 1 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: Commonwealth employee means an employee of the Commonwealth. 2 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: Commonwealth industrial award means: an industrial award or determination made under a law of the Commonwealth; or an industrial agreement approved or registered under such a law. 3 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: CSS means the scheme known as the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. 4 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: defined benefit superannuation scheme has the meaning given by section 6A. 5 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: defined benefit member means a member entitled on retirement to be paid a benefit defined, wholly or in part, by reference to either or both of the following: the amount of the member's salary: at the date of the member's retirement or an earlier date; or averaged over a period before retirement; a specified amount. 6 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: PSS means the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme within the meaning of the Superannuation Act 1990 . 7 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: State industrial award means: an industrial award or determination made under a law of a State; or an industrial agreement approved or registered under such a law. 8 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: Territory industrial award means: an industrial award or determination made under a law of a Territory; or an industrial agreement approved or registered under such a law. 9 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: unfunded public sector scheme means a public sector scheme that is a defined benefit superannuation scheme: in respect of which no fund is established for the purposes of the scheme; or under which all or some of the amounts that will be required for the payment of benefits are not paid into the fund established for the purposes of the scheme or are not paid until the members become entitled to receive the benefits. 1 0 Subsection 1 9 ( 2 ) Omit 'subsection (4)', substitute 'subsections (2A) and (4)'. 1 1 After Subsection 1 9 ( 2 ) Insert: If an employer makes one or more contributions (the no choice contributions ) to a fund other than a defined benefit superannuation scheme, or an RSA, on behalf of an employee during a quarter and the contributions are not made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements, the quarterly short fall for the employer in respect of the employee is increased by the amount worked out with the formula: where: notional quarterly shortfall is the amount that would have been worked out under subsection (2) if the no choice contributions had not been made. Note: Part 3B sets out the choice of fund requirements. If: a reduction of the charge percentage for an employee for a quarter is made under subsection 22 (2) in respect of a defined benefit superannuation scheme; and there is at least one relevant day in the quarter where, if contributions (the notional contributions ) had been made to the scheme by the employer for the benefit of the employee on the day, the notional contributions would have been made not in compliance with the choice of fund requirements; and section 19A (which deals with certain cases where no contributions are required) does not apply to the employer in respect of the employee in respect of the scheme for the quarter; the quarterly shortfall for the employer in respect of the employee is increased by the amount worked out with the formula: where: notional quarterly shortfall is the amount that would have been worked out under subsection (2) if no reduction were made under subsection 22 (2) in respect of the scheme. n u m b e r o f b r e a c h o f c o n d i t i o n s d a y s i s t h e n u m b e r o f r e l e v a n t d a y s i n t h e q u a r t e r o n w h i c h , i f a c o n t r i b u t i o n h a d b e e n m a d e t o t h e s c h e m e b y t h e e m p l o y e r f o r t h e b e n e f i t o f t h e e m p l o y e e , t h o s e c o n t r i b u t i o n s w o u l d h a v e b e e n m a d e n o t i n c o m p l i a n c e w i t h t h e c h o i c e o f f u n d r e q u i r e m e n t s . Note: Part 3B sets out the choice of fund requirements. The following days in a quarter are relevant days for the purposes of subsection (2B): if the value of B in the formula in subsection 22 (2) for the quarter is 1 - every day in the quarter; or in any other case - every day in the quarter that is in the shorter of the scheme membership period or the certificate period referred to in subsection 22 (2). A reference in subsections (2A) and (2B) to the quarterly shortfall being increased includes a reference to the shortfall being increased from nil. 1 2 A f t e r P a r t 3 Insert: Part 3A - Choice of superannuation investment requirements Division 1 - Overview of Part 32A Purpose of Part This Part sets out the requirement for certain superannuation funds to offer members a choice of investments within the fund. 32B Meaning of funds - includes RSAs and schemes In this Part: fund means: a superannuation fund; and a superannuation scheme; and an RSA; but does not include a defined benefit superannuation scheme or a fund of which a member is a defined benefit member. For the purposes of this Part, the holder of an RSA is taken to be a member. Division 2 - Which contributions satisfy the choice of superannuation investment requirements? 32C Contributions that satisfy the choice of superannuation investment requirements C o n t r i b u t i o n s t o c e r t a i n f u n d s A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is made in compliance with the choice of superannuation investment requirements if the contribution is made to a fund, that, at the time that the contribution is made: satisfies the requirements of section 32D; and is a fund in which an employee has chosen an investment strategy in accordance with Division 4; or is a complying fund which offers member investment choice with a minimum of 3 investment options; or, if the employee is not a Commonwealth employee who is a member of the CSS or the PSS, is an unfunded public sector scheme. S m a l l f u n d s A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of superannuation investment requirements if the contribution is made to a fund with fewer than 50 members. C o n t r i b u t i o n s b e f o r e c e r t a i n d a t e A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of superannuation investment requirements if the contribution is made before 1 July 2000. Division 3 - What are the choice of superannuation investment requirements? 32D The choice of superannuation investment requirements A fund satisfies the choice of superannuation investment requirements if it offers members: a choice of 3 or more investment strategies including low, medium and higher risk strategies; and a description of the investment objectives of each of the strategies mentioned in paragraph (a); and information to assist the member or prospective member to understand the effect of, and the risks associated with, each of the strategies offered. Division 4 - Choosing an investment strategy within a superannuation fund 32E Notification by employer An employer must notify each employee of his or her right to choose an investment strategy within a superannuation fund. 32F What happens if an employee does not choose an investment strategy? If an employee does not make a nomination within 28 days after receiving a notification under section 32E, the employee's contributions are to be invested at the discretion of the fund trustees, provided that the fund trustees take all reasonable steps to maximise the retirement income return to the employee, taking into account the employee's age and pattern of employment. Part 3B - Choice of fund requirements Division 1 - Overview of Part 32G Purpose of Part This Part sets out the circumstances in which contributions are made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements. 32H Meaning of funds - includes RSAs and schemes In this Part fund has the same meaning as in Part 3A. For the purposes of this Part, the holder of an RSA is taken to be a member. Division 2 - Which contributions satisfy the choice of fund requirements? 32J Contributions that satisfy the choice of fund requirements C o n t r i b u t i o n s t o c e r t a i n f u n d s A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is made in compliance with the choice of superannuation investment requirements if the contribution is made to a fund, that, at the time that the contribution is made, is: a chosen fund for the employee (see Division 3); or a default fund for the employee (see Division 4); or; if the employee is not a Commonwealth employee who is a member of the CSS or the PSS - an unfunded public sector scheme. C o n t r i b u t i o n s u n d e r A W A s o r c e r t i f i e d a g r e e m e n t s A c o n t r i b u t i o n t o a f u n d b y a n e m p l o y e r f o r t h e b e n e f i t o f a n e m p l o y e e i s a l s o m a d e i n c o m p l i a n c e w i t h t h e c h o i c e o f f u n d r e q u i r e m e n t s i f t h e c o n t r i b u t i o n i s m a d e u n d e r , o r i n a c c o r d a n c e w i t h , a n A W A o r a c e r t i f i e d a g r e e m e n t u n d e r t h e W o r k p l a c e R e l a t i o n s A c t 1 9 9 6 o r a c e r t i f i e d a g r e e m e n t u n d e r t h e I n d u s t r i a l R e l a t i o n s A c t 1 9 8 8 . C o n t r i b u t i o n s u n d e r c e r t a i n V i c t o r i a n a g r e e m e n t s A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements if the contribution is made under, or in accordance with, an employee agreement that was in force under the Employee Relations Act 1992 of Victoria and which continues to be in operation by virtue of section 515 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 . C o n t r i b u t i o n s b e f o r e c e r t a i n d a t e A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements if the contribution is made before 1 July 2002. C o n t r i b u t i o n s m a d e a f t e r e m p l o y e e s c e a s e e m p l o y m e n t If: an employee ceases to be employed by an employer; and after the employment ceases, the employer makes a contribution to a fund for the benefit of the employee and in respect of the employment; then, for the purposes of this section, the contribution is taken to have been made immediately before the employment ceases. Note: This section is used in determining if a quarterly shortfall for an employer is increased under subsection 19 (2A) or 19 (2B). Where subsection 19 (2B) is relevant, the contributions referred to in this section are the notional contributions referred to in paragraph 19 (2B) (b). Division 3 - What is a chosen fund? 32K What is a chosen fund? A fund is a chosen fund for an employee if it is a fund nominated for the time being by the employee and approved by the employer. 32L Choosing a fund This section sets out the procedures that an employer must go through before an employer makes a contribution to a fund for the benefit of an employee. The employer must: notify the employee of his or her right to choose a fund; and invite the employee to make a choice of fund within 28 days after being notified under paragraph (a). An employee may nominate a fund to his or her employer. A nomination under subsection (3) must be in writing and agreed by the employee. The employer must give the employee a copy of the nomination and of the employer's approval of the nomination. The employer must retain a copy of the nomination. An employer who intentionally or recklessly contravenes subsection (2) is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 10 penalty units. 32M When must a choice be offered? An employer must offer a choice of funds: to any new employee; and to any existing employee who makes a written request to the employer to do so; and when the employer becomes aware that there ceased to be any chosen or default fund for an employee. 32N Contributions satisfy Commonwealth, State or Territory industrial award requirements A requirement in a Commonwealth industrial award or a State industrial award or a Territory industrial award that an employer make contributions to a superannuation fund on behalf of an employee is not enforceable to the extent that the employer instead makes the contributions on behalf of the employee, in compliance with this Part, to another superannuation fund that is a chosen fund or a default fund. 32O Information to be provided by funds to enable employee choice Information provided by funds to employees to enable employees to choose an appropriate fund must be in a prescribed form. Division 4 - Default funds 32P When is there a default fund? There is a default fund for an employee at any time when there is no chosen fund for that employee. 32Q What fund is a default fund? If: an employee has been offered a choice of funds under section 32L but has not nominated a fund within the time provided; and the employee is covered by a Commonwealth, State or Territory industrial award; the default fund is the fund specified in the industrial award. If there is more than one fund specified in the award, the default fund is the one chosen by the employer for that purpose. If: an employee has been offered a choice of funds under section 32L but has not nominated a fund within the time provided; and the employee is not covered by a Commonwealth, State or Territory industrial award; the default fund is the fund to which a majority of employees at that employee's workplace belong. If: an employee has been offered a choice of funds under section 32L but has not nominated a fund within the time provided; and the employee is employed by a new business which is not covered by a Commonwealth, State or Territory industrial award; the default fund is the fund specified in the relevant industrial award. Part 2 - Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 13 Section 52 Repeal the section. 1 4 Subsection 5 3 ( 3 ) Repeal the subsection. 1 5 Subsection 5 6 ( 1 ) Omit '52,'. 1 6 Subsection 6 2 ( 1 ) After 'employee', insert 'unless the RSA is a chosen fund for the employee under Part 3B of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 . Part 3 - Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 17 Subsection 143 (1) Repeal the subsection, substitute: The object of this Part is to prohibit false and misleading conduct and other forms of improper conduct in relation to superannuation interests and regulated documents. 1 8 A f t e r p a r a g r a p h 1 4 3 ( 2 ) ( e ) Insert: other forms of improper conduct (sections 148CA); 1 9 A f t e r s e c t i o n 1 4 8 C Insert: 148CA Improper conduct The trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, must not: supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person; or supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person at a particular price; or give or allow, or offer to give or allow, a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to the supply, or the proposed supply, of goods or services to a person; on the condition that one or more of the employees of the person will hold, or has applied or agreed to hold, a superannuation interest provided by the trustee or the associate of the trustee. A trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, must not refuse: to supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person; or to supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person at a particular price; or to give or allow, or offer to give or allow, a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to the supply, or the proposed supply, of goods or services to a person; for the reason that one or more of the employees of the person does not hold, or has not applied or agreed to hold, a superannuation interest provided by the trustee or the associate of the trustee. If: the trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, contravenes subsection (1) or (2); and a person suffers loss or damage because of the contravention; the person may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the trustee or the associate of the trustee, as the case may be. The action must be begun within 6 years after the day on which the cause of action arise. This section does not affect any liability under any other provision of this Act or under any other law. Amendment No. 1 essentially sets out the opposition's alternative choice model. I want to make a few remarks about it shortly, but before I do that I would like to pursue some issues and raise some questions with the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation that arise from his second reading speech. Firstly, Minister, in your second reading speech you said: The government is continuing to work with industry on the design details of the proposed key features statements. Draft key features statements were prepared in consultation with industry and have been market tested . . . Is it possible for the opposition to get a copy of the proposed draft key features statements and will the government also release the results of the market testing of the key features statements? I make those requests because the information would be helpful in assisting the opposition to further refine its own choice of funds model, and if the results of the market testing are in fact positive I would have thought that the government would be happy to release the information. That is the first query. In your second reading speech you said that the government was not prepared to compromise on the fundamentals of its choice of funds model and that one of those fundamentals was to ensure that employees get a genuine choice as to which fund their superannuation is paid to. Labor is not opposed to that choice fundamental - about employees getting a genuine choice as to where their superannuation money goes. That is precisely why we have proposed our model and are opposing yours, which gives employers the choice of fund rather than employees. My query is: under the government's model does an employer have the right to not accept an employee's nominated superannuation fund? I am interested in your response to that. The third thing I wanted to take up with you is whether an employee who is nominated or who is employed by more than one employer has the right to ask a second employer to pay their superannuation contributions into the fund chosen by the employee as their preferred superannuation fund. If that is the case, does the second employer have the right under the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998 - under the government's model - to refuse to pay the employee's superannuation contributions into the superannuation fund that the employee has with the first employer? I seek some responses to those questions. While you are thinking about those questions, I would like to follow up a couple of observations made by speakers in the debate on the second reading - the member for Curtin and the member for Parramatta. The member for Curtin said that she could not understand how Labor thought that costs would go up pursuant to the government's choice model. I would direct her to the explanatory memorandum of the bill at page 48 which states that funds will have, from the point of view of employers, initial costs of the order of $21 million and recurrent costs of the order of $15 million and that the funds themselves would have initial costs of the order of $5 million and recurrent costs of the order of $2 million. Given that the government's own explanatory memorandum says that costs will go up, that seems to us to inevitably lead to lower retirement incomes. The explanatory memorandum certainly does not say that costs will come down. The member for Parramatta made a couple of references to Mr Ken Lockery, the principal of Towers Perrin, concerning the issue of choice. I point out to the member for Parramatta that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation heard from Ken Lockery and before the Senate committee he noted that the majority of employees in large employer based or industry funds would not receive any benefit and might instead suffer an economic loss. He pointed out that the government was ignoring the fact that competitive choice already exists in the superannuation industry at the wholesale market level. He said: The key issue that the government has failed to recognise is the efficiency of our present trustee based system in producing intense competition at the wholesale level between investment managers and between fund administrators. It is clear that many other industry participants support our views. Clearly, the evidence that Mr Lockery put to that Senate committee very much endorses the concerns that the opposition has expressed. (Time expired)"
"UK6","by leave - I move opposition amendments Nos 2 to 15: Clause 2, page 2 (line 2), omit '1 July 1999', substitute '1 July 2000' Schedule 1, item 15, page 7 (lines 1 to 14), omit the item, substitute: 1 5 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: industry-based superannuation fund means a complying fund or complying superannuation scheme that: has 2 or more employer-sponsors; and is a fund which operates on a not-for-profit basis; and complies with section 89 (1) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (basic equal representation rules). A fund is also an industry-based superannuation fund if it meets the above requirements and is nominated in a Commonwealth award, a State award or a Territory award immediately before the commencement. Schedule 1, item 25, page 11 (line 4), omit '1999', substitute '2000'. Schedule 1, item 32, page 14 (lines 14 to 20), omit subsection (2), substitute: Contributions under AWAs , Certified Agreements or Federal or Territory Awards A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements if the contribution is made under or in accordance with, an AWA, a certified agreement under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 , a certified agreement under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 , a Commonwealth industrial award, or a Territory industrial award. Schedule 1, item 32, page 15 (lines 21 to 26), omit paragraphs (a) to (c), substitute 'before 1 July 2000'. Schedule 1, item 32, page 19 (line 31) to page 20 (line 17), omit subsections (1) and (2), substitute: Subject to this section, if before the commencement of this section an employer has contributed to a complying superannuation fund, a complying superannuation scheme or an RSA for the benefit of an employee and that contribution would have been in compliance with the choice of fund requirements; and it is possible for the employer to contribute to the fund on behalf of the employee; and since the employer last contributed to that fund for the benefit of the employee, the employer has not contributed to any other fund that, at the time the employer contributed to it, was a chosen fund for the employee; the fund is a default fund for the employee. Note: All such contributions made before 1 July 2000 are in compliance with the choice of fund requirements: see subsection 32C (4). If there is not a default fund for the employee under subsection (1), the employer may select as a default fund for the employee: any complying defined benefit scheme; or any complying superannuation fund or complying superannuation scheme which: provides a choice of investment options; or where the employee does not select an investment option within 28 days of being invited to, places the employee's contributions in a fund to be invested at the discretion of the fund trustees, provided that the fund trustees take all reasonable steps to maximise the retirement income return to the employee, taking into account the employee's age and pattern of employment; or unless the employee otherwise chooses, provides insurance in respect of the death or permanent disability of the employee; and complies with such other standards as may be prescribed. A fund is not a default fund for the purposes of this section if a commission is payable to any person in respect of the addition of employees to the fund, scheme or RSA or in respect of the payment of contributions to the fund, scheme or RSA. Schedule 2, item 32, page 23 (lines 5 to 9), omit subsection 32Q (1), substitute: For a limited choice offer to be valid, the offer must give the employee at least 4 choices from which to choose. Each choice must be a complying superannuation fund, a complying superannuation scheme or an RSA. No commission must be payable to any person in respect of the addition of employees to the fund, scheme or RSA or in respect of the payment of contributions to the fund, scheme or RSA. Schedule 1, item 32, page 24 (line 2), at the end of paragraph (1) (a), add: provided that the fund, scheme or RSA must not be one in respect of which commission is payable to any person in respect of the addition of employees to the fund, scheme or RSA or in respect of the payment of contributions to the fund, scheme or RSA. Schedule 1, item 32, page 26 (lines 25 to 32), omit proposed section 32X. Schedule 1, page 29 (after line 13), after item 40, insert: 4 0 A A t t h e e n d o f s e c t i o n 4 0 Add: The Commissioner must not give a notice under this section, stating that an entity is a complying superannuation fund, complying approved deposit fund or pooled superannuation trust unless the Commissioner is satisfied that any computer system used by the entity in the administration of its members' benefits is year 2000 compliant. In this section, year 2000 compliant means that the performance and functionality of a computer system will not be adversely affected by the change in date from 31 December 1999 to 1 January 2000. 4 0 B A t t h e e n d o f s e c t i o n 4 6 Add ', provided that the fund has provided evidence to the Commissioner that any computer system used by the fund for the administration of its members' benefits is year 2000 compliant within the meaning of subsection 40 (6). Schedule 1, item 45, page 33 (lines 25 and 26), omit the item, substitute: 4 5 Subsection 1 4 3 ( 1 ) Repeal the subsection, substitute: The object of this Part is to prohibit false and misleading conduct and other forms of improper conduct in relation to superannuation interests and regulated documents. Schedule 1, item 46, page 34 (line 8), after paragraph (e), insert: other forms of improper conduct (sections 148CA); and Schedule 1, item 50, page 36 (after line 10), after section 148C, insert: 148CA Improper conduct The trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, must not: supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person; or supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person at a particular price; or give or allow, or offer to give or allow, a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to the supply, or the pro posed supply, of goods or services to a person; on the condition that one or more of the employees of the person will hold, or has applied or agreed to hold, a superannuation interest provided by the trustee or the associate of the trustee. A trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, must not refuse: to supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person; or to supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person at a particular price; or to give or allow, or offer to give or allow, a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to the supply, or the proposed supply, of goods or services to a person; for the reason that one or more of the employees of the person does not hold, or has not applied or agreed to hold, a superannuation interest provided by the trustee or the associate of the trustee. If: the trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, contravenes subsection (1) or (2); and a person suffers loss or damage because of the contravention; the person may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the trustee or the associate of the trustee, as the case may be. The action must be begun within 6 years after the day on which the cause of action arise. This section does not affect any liability under any other provision of this Act or under any other law. Schedule 1, item 67, page 39 (line 9), omit '1999', substitute '2000'. I will speak briefly in support of the amendments. Included within these amendments are amendments that would extend the start date of choice to 1 July 2000 for both new and existing employees. This amendment is widely supported by both people in the superannuation industry and employers, who are dreading the government's policy of having two separate classes of employees. Having two distinct classes of employees - those employed before 1 July 1999 and those employed after - is entirely inconsistent with the government's argument for wanting to do away with award based superannuation. As we have seen so many times before, the government has an inconsistent position and argument on superannuation. We want to do a favour for the government, employees, employers and superannuation funds by moving amendments which will align the start date for the government's so-called superannuation choice for new and existing employees. We think that the start date ought to be the same, and it ought to be 1 July 2000. The whole superannuation industry has called for this extension of time, including the peak superannuation body, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. We also have amendments which revise the definition of `industry based fund'. This amendment replaces the government's definition of industry based fund with a definition which more accurately reflects what a true industry based fund is. This amendment will apply only in the case where, under the government's model, an employer chooses to offer his or her employees the four choice of funds offer - where an employee will have to choose one of four funds. It does that by requiring a fund which seeks to qualify under this definition of an industry based fund to be a not-for-profit fund which operates purely in the best interests of the members of that fund. Amendments in this package relate to the removal of clause 32X, which overrides federal awards. These amendments go to the heart of the entire choice of superannuation debate. The overriding of award based superannuation entitlements, which is what the government is proposing here and in legislation we debated yesterday, is really what the government is all about. The effect of Labor's amendment is to remove 32X from the government's bill, which would otherwise override federal awards. This is hypocritical. Clause 32W says that awards will not be overridden for the purposes of determining notional earnings bases on which to base an employee's superannuation contributions. The reason for this is that, if the award provisions are overridden, em ployers will lose the basis on which to determine an employee's salary for superannuation purposes because that is contained in awards. That means that some employees could choose a fund that would require greater contributions than they are presently receiving. That, in turn, would cost employers more. Surprise, surprise! The government has decided that it wants to do something about this, presumably following lobbying from employer representatives. They say, `We're going to insert a clause which says, 'Well, even though the award no longer applies for superannuation purposes, we'll pretend that it still does just so employers won't be liable to pay any more than they currently are liable to pay.'' We are also moving amendments relating to the default fund option. Because of the complexity of the government's choice of fund model the default fund arrangements are crucial, so we are moving amendments in that area. We are also moving amendments concerning the avoidance of commission based sales under the choice regime. We do not want to see the sorts of things that occurred in places like Chile and, indeed, in the UK. These amendments are designed to try to ensure that that does not happen. We are moving amendments that concern the need for superannuation funds to be year 2000 compliant and, finally, we have an amendment concerning third line forcing provisions - once again, a very important one. If employers are not discouraged from entering into third line forcing arrangements with other parties, the retirement incomes of many Australians will suffer. Having said that in support of the amendments, I hope the House will support them for the benefit of the retirement incomes of thousands of Australian working men and women."

"BT4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department has not undertaken any measures which are categorised as positive discrimination programs. DETYA has been implementing Workplace Diversity, Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Equity measures in line with Government policy and its commitments under the Public Service Act. The Public Service Act requires the department to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate a Workplace Diversity program which incorporates EEO and Equity agendas. The department has been active in meeting this commitment and ensuring that it implements a system that is fair and equitable, and values diversity and non-discriminatory treatment of staff. One of the EEO principles is that judgements are genuinely based on merit. The merit principle aims to ensure people are judged fairly and without bias or favouritism. When offering equal employment opportunities and making decisions based on the merit principle, there are some groups in our society who are unable to gain equal access for a variety of historical and systematic reasons including prejudice, discrimination and unfair treatment. For this reason four EEO groups have been designated. They are women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people of non English speaking background and people with disabilities. In accordance with this, DETYA participates in the Australian Public Service wide programs designed by the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission such as the Senior Women In Management (SWIM) Program and the Indigenous Career Development programs such as the Aboriginal Undergraduate Study Awards (AUSA), the Aboriginal Staff Sponsorship Program (ASSP) and Indigenous Cadetships. Strategies designed to assist the designated groups are not designed to give preference to these individuals but rather to remove obstacles preventing them from gaining equal access to employment. What are the details and funding commitments involved in each case. The budget estimates for the 1998/99 financial year are as follows: DETYA Budget Estimates for 1998/99"

In taking this decision, the Bureau noted that progress in protecting Kakadu had been good and that adequate care had been taken by Australia in protection of World Heritage values. The mission has subsequently completed its visit to Kakadu. The matter was further considered by the World Heritage Bureau and the World Heritage Committee in November and December 1998. In relation to the Tasmanian Wilderness, the Bureau requested Australia to keep the World Heritage Committee informed of any potential boundary extensions that may be foreseen and to provide a timetable for the implementation of the Regional Forestry Agreement. The Bureau also considered information received from Australia on the state of conservation of the Great Barrier Reef, Shark Bay and the Wet Tropics. No."

"WI4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The report provided by Dr Stephen Webster on 3 October 1997 incorporated the outcome of work undertaken by BGC Media Pty Limited. This is a matter potentially relevant to current proceedings in the Federal Court arising out of matters related to the waterfront dispute in 1998. I consider it inappropriate that this question be answered while those proceedings remain on foot, as this might prejudice the proper conduct of that litigation and the interests of parties to the proceedings."
"WI4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The report provided by Dr Stephen Webster on 3 October 1997 incorporated the outcome of work undertaken by Dr John Davies.

"JK6","asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: What are the administrative costs to the date of answering this question for the payment of childcare assistance to out of school hours centres. What is the lowest sum per week of childcare assistance being paid to an eligible parent. How many applications for childcare assistance does Centrelink have on hand. How many applications referred to in part (3) were received before 29 May 1998. Will all eligible applications for childcare assistance received before 29 May 1998 be backdated. Has Centrelink sent out multiple notifications of eligibility for childcare assistance to the same families."
"GT4","The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: This information is not available. The amount of Childcare Assistance a family receives in a week depends on the hours of care they use in a week and the family's income. There is no minimum amount of Childcare Assistance. Minimum payment is rounded to the nearest $0.10. As at 27 January 1999, Centrelink had 1,817 unfinalised Childcare Assistance applications on hand. None of the aforementioned 1,817 unfinalised Childcare Assistance applications on hand were received before 29 May 1998. Centrelink includes a date of effect on the Childcare Assistance assessment notices sent to both parents and service providers. This date of effect is the date that the parent lodged their application (or the date which the parent contacted Centrelink to request an application form as long as that application form was lodged with Centrelink within 7 calendar days). Service providers may backdate Childcare Assistance a further 7 days prior to this date of effect. Outside school hours care service providers have been encouraged to backdate Childcare Assistance to 27 April 1998 (30 May in Tasmania) for customers who had lodged an application with Centrelink prior to 31 May 1998 (or 30 June in Tasmania). Each time a family's entitlement to Childcare Assistance is reassessed Centrelink sends one notification of assessment to that family. This notification details all children in the family using child care as well as detailing the service providers used by those children."
"BT4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Hansard shows that Mr Abbott, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs was not in attendance at the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee hearing on 25 February. It is possible that Mr McClelland has confused Senator Ellison, then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, with the former Parliamentary Secretary. At the hearing, Senator Carr asked that a table provided to the Committee in 1996 in response to Question on Notice No. 52 showing Schools funding in real terms to 1999-2000 be updated (question no. 660). This question was taken on notice. After seeking advice from Treasury, the Department answered as follows: 'Question no. 52 may not be updated by the Department due to the Government's policy not to release information which would provide, or which may be used to calculate, cost index parameters.' At the Budget Estimates hearing in June, Senator Carr tabled a further question asking whether it had always been government policy not to release such parameters (question no. 35). The Department answered in the affirmative."
"QJ4","asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 November 1998: What is the position of the Australian Government in relation to the detention in Great Britain of General Augusto Pinochet. Does the Government acknowledge that the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights adds significance to supporting the actions of the British, Spanish and European officials seeking to bring General Pinochet to justice. Is it appropriate for Australia to bring to Chile's attention matters pertaining to the violation of human rights by the Pinochet regime, particularly crimes against humanity and other forms of violation of human rights, as requested by bodies such as Amnesty International. Has the Prime Minister raised with APEC or the Chilean Government matters relating to human rights violations by General Pinochet. Has his attention been drawn to the presence in Australia of former Chileans, many of whom have become Australian citizens, whose family members were killed or disappeared during the Pinochet regime, those responsible remaining free and untried. Will the Australian Government support the case of Manuel Moreno, an Australian citizen originally from Chile, whose son was executed during the Pinochet dictatorship."
"4G4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government recognises that there were many serious human rights abuses in Chile during Senator Pinochet's Presidency. The Government is committed to the protection and promotion of human rights as an integral part of its foreign policy. However, the Australian Government accepts that the issue of whether Senator Pinochet should be extradited to Spain is for the relevant British authorities to decide. Senator Pinochet's rights and obligations will be determined in accordance with existing arrangements under British and Spanish law, taking into account relevant treaty obligations. At the same time, the Government acknowledges that this is a very difficult time for the Government and people of Chile, particularly in the context of Chile's political transition and reconciliation. As citizens of a democratic state they face the challenge of balancing the need for justice with the requirements of reconciliation. The Australian Government's enduring commitment to the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was recently reaffirmed by the Parliamentary motion moved by the Prime Minister and passed by the House of Representatives on 10 December 1998 to mark the 50th Anniversary of the UDHR. However, as stated above, the Australian Government accepts that the issue of whether Senator Pinochet should be extradited to Spain is for the relevant British authorities to decide. The Government therefore believes that it would be inappropriate to comment on these legal proceedings. As stated above, the Australian Government is committed to the promotion and protection of human rights. However, the Australian Government also recognises the sovereign right of the Chilean people and Government to determine the most appropriate means of delivering and consolidating a transition to full democracy. The Australian Government does not believe that it would be appropriate or helpful to comment on the means chosen by Chile to attain this goal. Advice from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is that the Prime Minister has not raised with APEC or the Chilean Government matters relating to human rights violations by Senator Pinochet. and (6) The Australian Government recognises that serious violations of human rights occurred during Senator Pinochet's Presidency and acknowledges that many Chilean Australians suffered under his regime. In relation to the specific case mentioned, I would be grateful for more information before providing a response."
"KL6","asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 1 December 1998: Will he ensure that operators of licensed post offices will not face competition from the introduction of rural transaction centres."
"KL6","asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 1 December 1998: Has the Government raised the maximum weight limit of semitrailers from 42.5 to 45.5 tonnes; if so, will the Government compensate councils who need to upgrade their bridges as a result; if not, why not."
"4K4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has not raised the maximum weight of semitrailers from 42.5 to 45.5 tonnes. There is a proposal from the National Road Transport Commission to increase mass limits for heavy vehicles fitted with road friendly suspension under which the mass limit for a six axle semitrailer would increase from 42.5 to 45.5 tonnes. The proposal is being supported by the Government because of the productivity improvements it will mean for the road transport industry which will benefit the broader community. One of the issues that is being considered by Commonwealth, State and Territory Transport Ministers is funding for the bridge upgrading required to implement the mass limit increase and the Government has committed to contribute to a bridge upgrading program."
"8.00E+04","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is methodologically difficult to directly measure the number of persons dependent on 'hard drugs' due to a range of factors including the illegal nature of the activity and the difficulty of gaining access to such hidden populations. A 1997 study conducted for the Australian National Council on AIDS and Related Diseases (ANCARD) Hepatitis C Sub-Committee, estimated that there were 100,000 regular injecting drug users in 1997 with a further 175,000 people injecting drugs on an occasional basis (Hepatitis C Virus Projections Working Group, `Estimates and Projections of the Hepatitis C Virus Epidemic in Australia', August 1998). For the purposes of this study, a 'regular' injecting drug user was someone who had injected for at least 12 months, an average of 10 times per month, with injecting in most months. Heroin and amphetamines (or a combination of the two) were given as the drugs most commonly injected. Funding is currently being provided by my Department to the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre to revise the estimate of the number of dependent heroin users in Australia. An updated estimate is due at the end of the 1999 calendar year. I would be happy to provide the honourable member with the details when they become available The estimate of 100,000 regular injecting drug users in 1997 represented 0.3% of the total population in that year."
"K26","asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 9 December 1998: What requirements exist for the new owners of privatised airports to (a) observe competition policy practices, such as competitive tendering for the use of retail space, and (b) avoid monopoly pricing practices on the lease of retail space. Are the requirements referred to in part (1) being met by the new owner of Canberra Airport."
"4K4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b) Overall, retail tenants of the privatised airports are afforded the same trade practices protection available to off-airport businesses. This protection is provided for through Commonwealth legislation such as the Trade Practices Act 1974 and applicable State or Territory Legislation governing commercial trading (these laws apply at leased airports). In the case of Canberra Airport, retail tenants are afforded the protection of the ACT Tenancy Tribunal Act 1994 and the Commercial and Retail leases Code of Practice made under that Act. Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd advise that the terms of the leases (including rent provisions) held by the two retail tenants at Canberra Airport have not changed since the airport was privatised in May 1998."
"ET4","asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 8 February 1999: How many employees in the Minister's Department have their principal conditions of employment set by (a) an award, (b) an industrial agreement, (c) a certified agreement and (d) an Australian workplace agreement. What is the classification of each person in the Minister's Department employed under an Australian workplace agreement."
"ZD4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that the number of employees who have their principal conditions of employment set by (a) an award, (b) an industrial agreement, (c) a certified agreement and (d) an Australian workplace agreement is: nil; nil; 348; and 34. The classifications of persons employed under an Australian workplace agreement within the Department are: Senior Executive Band 1; Senior Executive Band 2; and Senior Executive Band 3."
