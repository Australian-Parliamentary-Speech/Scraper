"KFS","Germany is now frankly mobilized on the grand scale for the overrunning and acquisition of any near country which excites its cupidity. Mr.Curtin. - I imagine that Mr. Chamberlain will not thank the Minister for this speech. The Leader of the Opposition will have an opportunity to make his comments in due course. I invite the honorable gentleman to study the speech made by Mr. Chamberlain at Birmingham quite recently. The objective of Germany is no longer a professed and almost religious impulse to attach to the Reich Germans, who, as Hitler has so often declared, were dwelling in an agony of mind, and suffering discriminating treatment under an alien government. The objective has become purely material, and conquest is openly planned for the glorification of Germany and the gain of currency reserves, productive soil, oil wells, or anything else which in Hitler's mind is necessary or desirable to the Fatherland. So Austria was overrun without the firing of a shot."
