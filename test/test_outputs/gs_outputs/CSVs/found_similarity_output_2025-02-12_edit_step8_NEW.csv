"249710","On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, Report 225: Australia-UAE CEPA; Australia-UAE investment agreement. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e). by leave—I'm pleased to make a statement on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report, Report 225: Australia-UAE CEPA; Australia-UAE investment agreement. The major treaty actions considered in this report are the comprehensive economic partnership agreement between Australia and the United Arab Emirates and the agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Australia on the promotion and protection of investments. The promotion and protection of investments agreement is an integral part of the economic partnership. Whilst the agreements were discussed separately in this report, they were considered together throughout this inquiry. This report also contains three minor treaty actions for which an inquiry was not conducted. The major treaties seek to diversify Australian trade with the UAE on over 99 per cent of exported goods—I'll repeat that, 99 per cent of exported goods. It provides for an expanding Australia-UAE investment in sectors such as renewable energy, agribusiness, tourism, health and aged care, and resources. It also provides investors with greatened certainty of access. The CEPA is Australia's first free trade agreement with the Middle East, and it sets to increase Australian exports by around $678 million per year. In addition to tariff removal, the two treaties provide scope for expanding Australia's UAE investment in sectors such as renewable energy, agribusiness, tourism, health and aged care, and resources. Once fully implemented, it is estimated that the agreements will increase Australian export by approximately $678 million per year. These agreements include standalone chapters that encourage environmental sustainability, women's economic empowerment, labour rights and improved animal welfare standards. These agreements are trying something new. In a first for Australia, these agreements also include standalone tractors that encourage sustainable agriculture and food systems, and trade and investment, and economic cooperation with First Nations people. In considering these agreements, the committee held two public hearings and received a combination of 24 submissions. A range of witnesses were consulted throughout the hearings including agriculture, farming and livestock industry representatives, representatives from unions, fair trade investment industry representatives and government agencies. The committee heard that these agreements will boost trade and investment between Australia and the UAE, which is great news for Australian farmers, primary producers and associated businesses. It will make goods and services from Australia cheaper for the UAE, making us more competitive on the global market and making Australia more attractive to UAE traders and investors. Throughout the hearing, some issues were raised and discussed. The importance of ongoing and transparent communication throughout the consultation process has been acknowledged by the committee, as have the concerns around labour rights and human rights in the UAE. The committee noted that the UAE is undertaking a process of reform in their practices around labour rights and human rights, and believes these agreements will encourage ongoing productive dialogue on these matters. Some unions and NGOs have expressed concern about the UAE's labour laws; however, it is evident that the promotion of labour protections was a priority in the trade negotiations between the Australian government and the UAE. The UAE has agreed for the first time for a dedicated chapter covering trade and labour. This chapter establishes a dialogue to advance labour rights; promotes compliance with international labour organisation standards and enforcement of labour laws; affirms a commitment to address forced labour, including in the supply chain; supports workforce development and respect for labour rights in the digital economy; promotes public awareness of labour laws; provides procedural guarantees; and enhances cooperation on labour matters of mutual respect. The agreements also include standalone chapters on women's economic empowerment. The UAE CEPA does not include an investor state dispute mechanism, labour market testing waiver or changes to the Foreign Investment Review Board. The committee supports both major treaties and recommends that a binding treaty be taken. The committee also supports the three minor treaty actions that have been included in this report. I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in this inquiry for their time, honesty and participation. Thank you for your valuable evidence. I would also like to thank the secretariat for working to get this done over the summer break. On behalf of the committee, I recommend the report to the House.","17"
"261393","I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following from occurring immediately: (1) the Member for Calare introducing the Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill; and (2) debate on the second reading of the bill proceeding for a period of no longer than one hour, after which any questions required to complete passage of the bill then being put without delay. Since I introduced the Keeping Cash Transactions Bill to this House, I have been overwhelmed with the response not only from around the electorate of Calare but also from around our nation. The response has been so positive and so forceful because people are worried that cash is going to be phased out. This groundbreaking legislation preserves the use of cash in our national economy. It does this by legislating that businesses operating in face-to-face settings must offer to accept and, crucially, must accept cash payments for transactions that do not exceed $10,000. The bill provides for maximum civil penalties of $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for companies—and it should be noted that they are civil penalties as opposed to criminal penalties. The bill also provides some important and practical exemptions to these requirements. They include that offering to accept cash would pose a reasonable security risk; that it would be contrary to another law of the Commonwealth or a law of a state or territory; that it would be contrary to the Commonwealth, state or territory health advice such as advice provided during a pandemic; and that cash in the form of change is needed but not readily available. It defies belief that cash can be legal tender in this country but businesses are not obliged to accept cash for transactions. All they have to do is make it known to a customer that cash is not accepted and they don't have to accept it. This is causing a huge amount of anxiety and grief in our communities, particularly our country communities. Many senior Australians do not want to use cards for their transactions. The Reserve Bank of Australia has found that Australians over the age of 65 are the heaviest users of cash. To many older Australians, cash is not just a convenience; it's a lifeline. In these times of economic uncertainty and rising costs, cash is actually an essential tool for managing finances and sticking to a budget. Many Australians find managing accounts and cards online to be a very stressful experience, and they find it confusing. Many Australians, particularly older Australians, don't want to use online banking or online accounts. I should point out, coming from a rural and regional area, that cash is often used in rural areas by individuals who don't have ready access to banking services. Many constituents in the Calare electorate are also worried that, if they are forced to switch to cards, they will face additional fees in the form of bank surcharges—and that is a very good point. Many Australians are now waking up to the fact that banks and financial institutions charge merchant fees for card transactions which can then be passed on to consumers. It's an insidious tax that is added to transactions just by tapping a card. It's been estimated that Australians are losing more than a billion dollars a year in surcharges when they pay by card and not by cash. I've had feedback from local businesses about my Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill. Many businesses actually want to keep cash as well; they don't want to switch to being solely digital. But, like many in our community, they are worried there may be an agenda either by governments or by large corporations to phase cash out. In country areas, we also need to consider the practicalities of internet connectivity. In many regional and rural areas reliable internet access does not exist, and cash remains a dependable means of exchange that does not rely on electricity or internet access. The bottom line is that cash transactions are unaffected by digital failures. During natural disasters like fires or floods, connectivity can be disrupted for many days—sometimes longer—rendering electronic payments unusable. As I've said, many Australians prefer cash as a means of managing their budget so they can physically see the money and it can be allocated to different expenses. I ask you: how can we teach our children about the value of money and budgeting if they don't actually know what it is? Other Australians worry about privacy and the risk of fraud associated with using cards. Many Australians have been victims of fraud and unauthorised transactions relating to cards and accounts linked to them. Privacy is another reason some Australians prefer to use cash over cards. And some people simply don't like or want corporations knowing every single thing they buy. It should be their choice, and they should have the right to use cash if they want to. This bill is not about imposing burdens and regulations on businesses; it's about striking a balance between innovation and inclusivity and preserving the essence of choice in our financial transactions and in our economy. It's about the freedom of Australians to choose how they will pay for their transactions. I note that the government has responded to my Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill by stating that there is a plan to make cash transactions compulsory for essential services. I accept the Treasurer and the member for Fenner have worked on this with the best will in the world, but unfortunately I don't think it is the approach that most in our communities would support. I think, speaking frankly, it's a second-best approach that acknowledges that the community wants action to keep cash, but I don't think it will be effective. I don't think it will stop businesses phasing out the use of cash. I don't think it will keep cash king in Australia. I think it will only end up applying to big businesses and, while it may force the supermarket giants and big fuel companies to keep cash, it won't go much further. I think Australians around our nation who still want to use cash for everyday transactions will be disappointed by the government's response to this issue. In country areas there are many people who don't buy their food and groceries from major supermarket chains, and they use cash to buy a whole range of goods and services which won't be caught by the government's so-called mandate. What the government is proposing simply is not strong enough. If the government is serious about keeping cash in Australia, it should be backing my bill. That's why this bill needs to be discussed and debated in this House and passed as a matter of urgency. Australians should have the confidence to carry cash in their wallets knowing that they can use their legal tender to make a purchase anywhere at any time As I've said, there are many people in our community who are crying out for action on this, and they haven't received it from this parliament. That's what my bill remedies. I would urge all members to support this bill. I think that this bill is vital to protect the right of Australians to choose how they will pay for their transactions. That's not a choice that should be made for them by financial institutions or businesses. So I commend this motion to the House and I urge Australians all over our great nation to get behind this bill and lobby their members of parliament to support this bill to preserve the use of cash in our society and in our economy. Many Australians are feeling marginalised by the move to a digital economy, they feel that they are being left behind and they feel that their voices are not being heard. They want to keep cash king in Australia. So I would urge all members to back this motion and keep cash king in Australia.","17"
"N/A","Electricity Infrastructure Legislation Amendment Bill 2025","12"
"M3C","I move the amendment circulated in my name: (1) Page 3 (after line 24), at the end of the Bill, add: Schedule 2 — Capacity Investment Scheme Program Climate Change Act 2022 1 After Part 4 Add: Part 4A — Capacity Investment Scheme 15B Simplified outline of this Part The Capacity Investment Scheme Program must be implemented to achieve at least 23 gigawatts of renewable generation capacity and at least 9 gigawatts of clean dispatchable capacity. 15C Administration of the Capacity Investment Scheme Program If, at the commencement of this subsection, the Capacity Investment Scheme Program is prescribed by legislative instrument under subsection 33(1) of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986, then: the Commonwealth must make, vary or administer arrangements in relation to the carrying out of activities by one or more persons under the Capacity Investment Scheme Program; and those arrangements must result in, by the end of 2030: at least 23 gigawatts of renewable generation capacity; and at least 9 gigawatts of clean dispatchable capacity. Note: The arrangements referred to in this subsection may include arrangements made, varied or administered before the commencement of this subsection. If advice of the Climate Change Authority under subsection 14 (1) indicates a material risk to the achievement of subsection (1), the Minister's Annual Climate Change Statement under section 12 must provide a response to that advice. 15D Amendment of the Capacity Investment Scheme Program (1) An instrument made under subsection 33(1) of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 (the amending instrument), that varies or revokes another instrument made under that subsection that prescribes the Capacity Investment Scheme Program, does not come into effect until the amending instrument has been approved by a resolution of each House of the Parliament. (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not apply to an instrument made under subsection 33(1) of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 that varies or revokes another instrument made under that subsection if that other instrument does not prescribe the Capacity Investment Scheme Program. One thing we know for sure is that the Liberals will stop at nothing to attack renewables. We have seen this in the past, where they used every opportunity to try and get rid of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency as well as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Those two agencies have driven huge investment in renewables in this country and given great confidence to the renewables industry, which we know we need to grow if we're to get out of coal and gas—which the scientists are telling us we must do if we are to have any chance of tackling the climate crisis. We also know that the Leader of the Opposition's dangerous nuclear fantasy is a ploy to extend the life of coal and gas in the system and threaten investment in renewables. We've even heard the Leader of the Opposition say so himself—that, under his dangerous fantasy of a plan, coal and gas will have to stay in the system for longer. In many respects, that is what his agenda is all about. We know that the opposition's energy policies have been written by the coal and gas industries because they know now that renewables are not only the best way of cutting emissions but are the cheapest form of electricity.","17"

"300126","I rise to acknowledge eight outstanding Australians from my electorate of Robertson who have this year received 2025 Australia Day honours. The Australian honours and awards system recognises the outstanding service and contributions of Australians. Recipients come from right across the country and from all walks of life. While some are well known, the majority are unsung heroes. While typically they haven't sought thanks or recognition, they deserve both. The honours and awards system gives Australians a chance to celebrate and acknowledge those who work tirelessly to improve local communities and to make Australia a better place, and I would like to take this opportunity to recognise each of these eight recipients who have dedicated themselves consistently and tirelessly in their respective fields. The Robertson 2025 Australia Day honours recipients include Mr Matthew Formston AM of Wamberal, who has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to people with a disability and to para sports. Matt Formston is no ordinary athlete. With less than three per cent vision, he is a world champion surfer, an Australian Paralympian, cyclist, author, executive coach and international keynote speaker. Matt's extraordinary journey includes surfing giant waves as a blind athlete, documented in the feature documentary The Blind Sea, and running clinics for visually impaired children to embrace the ocean's freedom. His impact extends to launching the award-winning children's book Surfing in the Dark and winning prestigious surfing awards, including a Guinness World Record for the largest wave. Matt is a relentless force, breaking barriers and inspiring people worldwide. The next recipient is Professor Julie Redfern AM of Terrigal, who has been appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to cardiology, allied health, research and education, and the community. Julie Redfern AM is a professor of public health and the 2022 New South Wales Woman of Excellence. Julie is also a physiotherapist, director of the Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare at Bond University, a member of the board of the World Heart Federation and a member of the Cardiac Society of Australia the New Zealand Scientific Committee. The next recipient is Emeritus Professor Joe Wolfe AM of Point Frederick, who was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to tertiary education and to music. Professor Joe Wolfe is a physicist, composer and professor at the University of New South Wales. He has worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University, at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO, and the Australian National University. As well as his research, Joe composes music for symphony orchestras and chamber ensembles. Mr Michael Buettner OAM of Terrigal has received the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the community and to sport. Michael is an Australian Rugby League official and was a professional footballer in the 1990s and 2000s. An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative back, he has played club football for the North Sydney Bears, the Northern Eagles, the Parramatta Eels and Wests Tigers. The late Mr Frank Davis OAM of Kincumber South has posthumously received a Medal of the Order of Australia for service to veterans and their families. There is also Dr Karen Douglas OAM of Avoca Beach, who has received a Medal of the Order of Australia for service to medicine as a general practitioner and to the community. Karen has worked as a GP and a practice owner of the Terrigal and Avoca Beach medical centres since 1990 and is a strong advocate for patients and their families, GPs, and other health professionals.
