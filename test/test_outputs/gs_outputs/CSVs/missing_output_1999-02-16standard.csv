"UK6","I move opposition amendment No. 1: Schedule 1, page 3 (line 2) to page 39 (line 11), omit the Schedule, substitute: Schedule 1 - Choice of superanua ion investment sand supranuation funds Part 1 - Superannuation Guarantee ( Administration ) Act 1992 1 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: Commonwealth employee means an employee of the Commonwealth. 2 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: Commonwealth industrial award means: an industrial award or determination made under a law of the Commonwealth; or an industrial agreement approved or registered under such a law. 3 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: CSS means the scheme known as the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. 4 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: defined benefit superannuation scheme has the meaning given by section 6A. 5 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: defined benefit member means a member entitled on retirement to be paid a benefit defined, wholly or in part, by reference to either or both of the following: the amount of the member's salary: at the date of the member's retirement or an earlier date; or averaged over a period before retirement; a specified amount. 6 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: PSS means the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme within the meaning of the Superannuation Act 1990 . 7 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: State industrial award means: an industrial award or determination made under a law of a State; or an industrial agreement approved or registered under such a law. 8 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: Territory industrial award means: an industrial award or determination made under a law of a Territory; or an industrial agreement approved or registered under such a law. 9 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: unfunded public sector scheme means a public sector scheme that is a defined benefit superannuation scheme: in respect of which no fund is established for the purposes of the scheme; or under which all or some of the amounts that will be required for the payment of benefits are not paid into the fund established for the purposes of the scheme or are not paid until the members become entitled to receive the benefits. 1 0 Subsection 1 9 ( 2 ) Omit 'subsection (4)', substitute 'subsections (2A) and (4)'. 1 1 After Subsection 1 9 ( 2 ) Insert: If an employer makes one or more contributions (the no choice contributions ) to a fund other than a defined benefit superannuation scheme, or an RSA, on behalf of an employee during a quarter and the contributions are not made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements, the quarterly short fall for the employer in respect of the employee is increased by the amount worked out with the formula: where: notional quarterly shortfall is the amount that would have been worked out under subsection (2) if the no choice contributions had not been made. Note: Part 3B sets out the choice of fund requirements. If: a reduction of the charge percentage for an employee for a quarter is made under subsection 22 (2) in respect of a defined benefit superannuation scheme; and there is at least one relevant day in the quarter where, if contributions (the notional contributions ) had been made to the scheme by the employer for the benefit of the employee on the day, the notional contributions would have been made not in compliance with the choice of fund requirements; and section 19A (which deals with certain cases where no contributions are required) does not apply to the employer in respect of the employee in respect of the scheme for the quarter; the quarterly shortfall for the employer in respect of the employee is increased by the amount worked out with the formula: where: notional quarterly shortfall is the amount that would have been worked out under subsection (2) if no reduction were made under subsection 22 (2) in respect of the scheme. n u m b e r o f b r e a c h o f c o n d i t i o n s d a y s i s t h e n u m b e r o f r e l e v a n t d a y s i n t h e q u a r t e r o n w h i c h , i f a c o n t r i b u t i o n h a d b e e n m a d e t o t h e s c h e m e b y t h e e m p l o y e r f o r t h e b e n e f i t o f t h e e m p l o y e e , t h o s e c o n t r i b u t i o n s w o u l d h a v e b e e n m a d e n o t i n c o m p l i a n c e w i t h t h e c h o i c e o f f u n d r e q u i r e m e n t s . Note: Part 3B sets out the choice of fund requirements. The following days in a quarter are relevant days for the purposes of subsection (2B): if the value of B in the formula in subsection 22 (2) for the quarter is 1 - every day in the quarter; or in any other case - every day in the quarter that is in the shorter of the scheme membership period or the certificate period referred to in subsection 22 (2). A reference in subsections (2A) and (2B) to the quarterly shortfall being increased includes a reference to the shortfall being increased from nil. 1 2 A f t e r P a r t 3 Insert: Part 3A - Choice of superannuation investment requirements Division 1 - Overview of Part 32A Purpose of Part This Part sets out the requirement for certain superannuation funds to offer members a choice of investments within the fund. 32B Meaning of funds - includes RSAs and schemes In this Part: fund means: a superannuation fund; and a superannuation scheme; and an RSA; but does not include a defined benefit superannuation scheme or a fund of which a member is a defined benefit member. For the purposes of this Part, the holder of an RSA is taken to be a member. Division 2 - Which contributions satisfy the choice of superannuation investment requirements? 32C Contributions that satisfy the choice of superannuation investment requirements C o n t r i b u t i o n s t o c e r t a i n f u n d s A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is made in compliance with the choice of superannuation investment requirements if the contribution is made to a fund, that, at the time that the contribution is made: satisfies the requirements of section 32D; and is a fund in which an employee has chosen an investment strategy in accordance with Division 4; or is a complying fund which offers member investment choice with a minimum of 3 investment options; or, if the employee is not a Commonwealth employee who is a member of the CSS or the PSS, is an unfunded public sector scheme. S m a l l f u n d s A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of superannuation investment requirements if the contribution is made to a fund with fewer than 50 members. C o n t r i b u t i o n s b e f o r e c e r t a i n d a t e A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of superannuation investment requirements if the contribution is made before 1 July 2000. Division 3 - What are the choice of superannuation investment requirements? 32D The choice of superannuation investment requirements A fund satisfies the choice of superannuation investment requirements if it offers members: a choice of 3 or more investment strategies including low, medium and higher risk strategies; and a description of the investment objectives of each of the strategies mentioned in paragraph (a); and information to assist the member or prospective member to understand the effect of, and the risks associated with, each of the strategies offered. Division 4 - Choosing an investment strategy within a superannuation fund 32E Notification by employer An employer must notify each employee of his or her right to choose an investment strategy within a superannuation fund. 32F What happens if an employee does not choose an investment strategy? If an employee does not make a nomination within 28 days after receiving a notification under section 32E, the employee's contributions are to be invested at the discretion of the fund trustees, provided that the fund trustees take all reasonable steps to maximise the retirement income return to the employee, taking into account the employee's age and pattern of employment. Part 3B - Choice of fund requirements Division 1 - Overview of Part 32G Purpose of Part This Part sets out the circumstances in which contributions are made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements. 32H Meaning of funds - includes RSAs and schemes In this Part fund has the same meaning as in Part 3A. For the purposes of this Part, the holder of an RSA is taken to be a member. Division 2 - Which contributions satisfy the choice of fund requirements? 32J Contributions that satisfy the choice of fund requirements C o n t r i b u t i o n s t o c e r t a i n f u n d s A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is made in compliance with the choice of superannuation investment requirements if the contribution is made to a fund, that, at the time that the contribution is made, is: a chosen fund for the employee (see Division 3); or a default fund for the employee (see Division 4); or; if the employee is not a Commonwealth employee who is a member of the CSS or the PSS - an unfunded public sector scheme. C o n t r i b u t i o n s u n d e r A W A s o r c e r t i f i e d a g r e e m e n t s A c o n t r i b u t i o n t o a f u n d b y a n e m p l o y e r f o r t h e b e n e f i t o f a n e m p l o y e e i s a l s o m a d e i n c o m p l i a n c e w i t h t h e c h o i c e o f f u n d r e q u i r e m e n t s i f t h e c o n t r i b u t i o n i s m a d e u n d e r , o r i n a c c o r d a n c e w i t h , a n A W A o r a c e r t i f i e d a g r e e m e n t u n d e r t h e W o r k p l a c e R e l a t i o n s A c t 1 9 9 6 o r a c e r t i f i e d a g r e e m e n t u n d e r t h e I n d u s t r i a l R e l a t i o n s A c t 1 9 8 8 . C o n t r i b u t i o n s u n d e r c e r t a i n V i c t o r i a n a g r e e m e n t s A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements if the contribution is made under, or in accordance with, an employee agreement that was in force under the Employee Relations Act 1992 of Victoria and which continues to be in operation by virtue of section 515 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 . C o n t r i b u t i o n s b e f o r e c e r t a i n d a t e A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements if the contribution is made before 1 July 2002. C o n t r i b u t i o n s m a d e a f t e r e m p l o y e e s c e a s e e m p l o y m e n t If: an employee ceases to be employed by an employer; and after the employment ceases, the employer makes a contribution to a fund for the benefit of the employee and in respect of the employment; then, for the purposes of this section, the contribution is taken to have been made immediately before the employment ceases. Note: This section is used in determining if a quarterly shortfall for an employer is increased under subsection 19 (2A) or 19 (2B). Where subsection 19 (2B) is relevant, the contributions referred to in this section are the notional contributions referred to in paragraph 19 (2B) (b). Division 3 - What is a chosen fund? 32K What is a chosen fund? A fund is a chosen fund for an employee if it is a fund nominated for the time being by the employee and approved by the employer. 32L Choosing a fund This section sets out the procedures that an employer must go through before an employer makes a contribution to a fund for the benefit of an employee. The employer must: notify the employee of his or her right to choose a fund; and invite the employee to make a choice of fund within 28 days after being notified under paragraph (a). An employee may nominate a fund to his or her employer. A nomination under subsection (3) must be in writing and agreed by the employee. The employer must give the employee a copy of the nomination and of the employer's approval of the nomination. The employer must retain a copy of the nomination. An employer who intentionally or recklessly contravenes subsection (2) is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 10 penalty units. 32M When must a choice be offered? An employer must offer a choice of funds: to any new employee; and to any existing employee who makes a written request to the employer to do so; and when the employer becomes aware that there ceased to be any chosen or default fund for an employee. 32N Contributions satisfy Commonwealth, State or Territory industrial award requirements A requirement in a Commonwealth industrial award or a State industrial award or a Territory industrial award that an employer make contributions to a superannuation fund on behalf of an employee is not enforceable to the extent that the employer instead makes the contributions on behalf of the employee, in compliance with this Part, to another superannuation fund that is a chosen fund or a default fund. 32O Information to be provided by funds to enable employee choice Information provided by funds to employees to enable employees to choose an appropriate fund must be in a prescribed form. Division 4 - Default funds 32P When is there a default fund? There is a default fund for an employee at any time when there is no chosen fund for that employee. 32Q What fund is a default fund? If: an employee has been offered a choice of funds under section 32L but has not nominated a fund within the time provided; and the employee is covered by a Commonwealth, State or Territory industrial award; the default fund is the fund specified in the industrial award. If there is more than one fund specified in the award, the default fund is the one chosen by the employer for that purpose. If: an employee has been offered a choice of funds under section 32L but has not nominated a fund within the time provided; and the employee is not covered by a Commonwealth, State or Territory industrial award; the default fund is the fund to which a majority of employees at that employee's workplace belong. If: an employee has been offered a choice of funds under section 32L but has not nominated a fund within the time provided; and the employee is employed by a new business which is not covered by a Commonwealth, State or Territory industrial award; the default fund is the fund specified in the relevant industrial award. Part 2 - Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 13 Section 52 Repeal the section. 1 4 Subsection 5 3 ( 3 ) Repeal the subsection. 1 5 Subsection 5 6 ( 1 ) Omit '52,'. 1 6 Subsection 6 2 ( 1 ) After 'employee', insert 'unless the RSA is a chosen fund for the employee under Part 3B of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 . Part 3 - Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 17 Subsection 143 (1) Repeal the subsection, substitute: The object of this Part is to prohibit false and misleading conduct and other forms of improper conduct in relation to superannuation interests and regulated documents. 1 8 A f t e r p a r a g r a p h 1 4 3 ( 2 ) ( e ) Insert: other forms of improper conduct (sections 148CA); 1 9 A f t e r s e c t i o n 1 4 8 C Insert: 148CA Improper conduct The trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, must not: supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person; or supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person at a particular price; or give or allow, or offer to give or allow, a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to the supply, or the proposed supply, of goods or services to a person; on the condition that one or more of the employees of the person will hold, or has applied or agreed to hold, a superannuation interest provided by the trustee or the associate of the trustee. A trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, must not refuse: to supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person; or to supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person at a particular price; or to give or allow, or offer to give or allow, a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to the supply, or the proposed supply, of goods or services to a person; for the reason that one or more of the employees of the person does not hold, or has not applied or agreed to hold, a superannuation interest provided by the trustee or the associate of the trustee. If: the trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, contravenes subsection (1) or (2); and a person suffers loss or damage because of the contravention; the person may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the trustee or the associate of the trustee, as the case may be. The action must be begun within 6 years after the day on which the cause of action arise. This section does not affect any liability under any other provision of this Act or under any other law. Amendment No. 1 essentially sets out the opposition's alternative choice model. I want to make a few remarks about it shortly, but before I do that I would like to pursue some issues and raise some questions with the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation that arise from his second reading speech. Firstly, Minister, in your second reading speech you said: The government is continuing to work with industry on the design details of the proposed key features statements. Draft key features statements were prepared in consultation with industry and have been market tested . . . Is it possible for the opposition to get a copy of the proposed draft key features statements and will the government also release the results of the market testing of the key features statements? I make those requests because the information would be helpful in assisting the opposition to further refine its own choice of funds model, and if the results of the market testing are in fact positive I would have thought that the government would be happy to release the information. That is the first query. In your second reading speech you said that the government was not prepared to compromise on the fundamentals of its choice of funds model and that one of those fundamentals was to ensure that employees get a genuine choice as to which fund their superannuation is paid to. Labor is not opposed to that choice fundamental - about employees getting a genuine choice as to where their superannuation money goes. That is precisely why we have proposed our model and are opposing yours, which gives employers the choice of fund rather than employees. My query is: under the government's model does an employer have the right to not accept an employee's nominated superannuation fund? I am interested in your response to that. The third thing I wanted to take up with you is whether an employee who is nominated or who is employed by more than one employer has the right to ask a second employer to pay their superannuation contributions into the fund chosen by the employee as their preferred superannuation fund. If that is the case, does the second employer have the right under the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998 - under the government's model - to refuse to pay the employee's superannuation contributions into the superannuation fund that the employee has with the first employer? I seek some responses to those questions. While you are thinking about those questions, I would like to follow up a couple of observations made by speakers in the debate on the second reading - the member for Curtin and the member for Parramatta. The member for Curtin said that she could not understand how Labor thought that costs would go up pursuant to the government's choice model. I would direct her to the explanatory memorandum of the bill at page 48 which states that funds will have, from the point of view of employers, initial costs of the order of $21 million and recurrent costs of the order of $15 million and that the funds themselves would have initial costs of the order of $5 million and recurrent costs of the order of $2 million. Given that the government's own explanatory memorandum says that costs will go up, that seems to us to inevitably lead to lower retirement incomes. The explanatory memorandum certainly does not say that costs will come down. The member for Parramatta made a couple of references to Mr Ken Lockery, the principal of Towers Perrin, concerning the issue of choice. I point out to the member for Parramatta that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation heard from Ken Lockery and before the Senate committee he noted that the majority of employees in large employer based or industry funds would not receive any benefit and might instead suffer an economic loss. He pointed out that the government was ignoring the fact that competitive choice already exists in the superannuation industry at the wholesale market level. He said: The key issue that the government has failed to recognise is the efficiency of our present trustee based system in producing intense competition at the wholesale level between investment managers and between fund administrators. It is clear that many other industry participants support our views. Clearly, the evidence that Mr Lockery put to that Senate committee very much endorses the concerns that the opposition has expressed. (Time expired)"
"UK6","by leave - I move opposition amendments Nos 2 to 15: Clause 2, page 2 (line 2), omit '1 July 1999', substitute '1 July 2000' Schedule 1, item 15, page 7 (lines 1 to 14), omit the item, substitute: 1 5 Subsection 6 ( 1 ) Insert: industry-based superannuation fund means a complying fund or complying superannuation scheme that: has 2 or more employer-sponsors; and is a fund which operates on a not-for-profit basis; and complies with section 89 (1) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (basic equal representation rules). A fund is also an industry-based superannuation fund if it meets the above requirements and is nominated in a Commonwealth award, a State award or a Territory award immediately before the commencement. Schedule 1, item 25, page 11 (line 4), omit '1999', substitute '2000'. Schedule 1, item 32, page 14 (lines 14 to 20), omit subsection (2), substitute: Contributions under AWAs , Certified Agreements or Federal or Territory Awards A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements if the contribution is made under or in accordance with, an AWA, a certified agreement under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 , a certified agreement under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 , a Commonwealth industrial award, or a Territory industrial award. Schedule 1, item 32, page 15 (lines 21 to 26), omit paragraphs (a) to (c), substitute 'before 1 July 2000'. Schedule 1, item 32, page 19 (line 31) to page 20 (line 17), omit subsections (1) and (2), substitute: Subject to this section, if before the commencement of this section an employer has contributed to a complying superannuation fund, a complying superannuation scheme or an RSA for the benefit of an employee and that contribution would have been in compliance with the choice of fund requirements; and it is possible for the employer to contribute to the fund on behalf of the employee; and since the employer last contributed to that fund for the benefit of the employee, the employer has not contributed to any other fund that, at the time the employer contributed to it, was a chosen fund for the employee; the fund is a default fund for the employee. Note: All such contributions made before 1 July 2000 are in compliance with the choice of fund requirements: see subsection 32C (4). If there is not a default fund for the employee under subsection (1), the employer may select as a default fund for the employee: any complying defined benefit scheme; or any complying superannuation fund or complying superannuation scheme which: provides a choice of investment options; or where the employee does not select an investment option within 28 days of being invited to, places the employee's contributions in a fund to be invested at the discretion of the fund trustees, provided that the fund trustees take all reasonable steps to maximise the retirement income return to the employee, taking into account the employee's age and pattern of employment; or unless the employee otherwise chooses, provides insurance in respect of the death or permanent disability of the employee; and complies with such other standards as may be prescribed. A fund is not a default fund for the purposes of this section if a commission is payable to any person in respect of the addition of employees to the fund, scheme or RSA or in respect of the payment of contributions to the fund, scheme or RSA. Schedule 2, item 32, page 23 (lines 5 to 9), omit subsection 32Q (1), substitute: For a limited choice offer to be valid, the offer must give the employee at least 4 choices from which to choose. Each choice must be a complying superannuation fund, a complying superannuation scheme or an RSA. No commission must be payable to any person in respect of the addition of employees to the fund, scheme or RSA or in respect of the payment of contributions to the fund, scheme or RSA. Schedule 1, item 32, page 24 (line 2), at the end of paragraph (1) (a), add: provided that the fund, scheme or RSA must not be one in respect of which commission is payable to any person in respect of the addition of employees to the fund, scheme or RSA or in respect of the payment of contributions to the fund, scheme or RSA. Schedule 1, item 32, page 26 (lines 25 to 32), omit proposed section 32X. Schedule 1, page 29 (after line 13), after item 40, insert: 4 0 A A t t h e e n d o f s e c t i o n 4 0 Add: The Commissioner must not give a notice under this section, stating that an entity is a complying superannuation fund, complying approved deposit fund or pooled superannuation trust unless the Commissioner is satisfied that any computer system used by the entity in the administration of its members' benefits is year 2000 compliant. In this section, year 2000 compliant means that the performance and functionality of a computer system will not be adversely affected by the change in date from 31 December 1999 to 1 January 2000. 4 0 B A t t h e e n d o f s e c t i o n 4 6 Add ', provided that the fund has provided evidence to the Commissioner that any computer system used by the fund for the administration of its members' benefits is year 2000 compliant within the meaning of subsection 40 (6). Schedule 1, item 45, page 33 (lines 25 and 26), omit the item, substitute: 4 5 Subsection 1 4 3 ( 1 ) Repeal the subsection, substitute: The object of this Part is to prohibit false and misleading conduct and other forms of improper conduct in relation to superannuation interests and regulated documents. Schedule 1, item 46, page 34 (line 8), after paragraph (e), insert: other forms of improper conduct (sections 148CA); and Schedule 1, item 50, page 36 (after line 10), after section 148C, insert: 148CA Improper conduct The trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, must not: supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person; or supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person at a particular price; or give or allow, or offer to give or allow, a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to the supply, or the pro posed supply, of goods or services to a person; on the condition that one or more of the employees of the person will hold, or has applied or agreed to hold, a superannuation interest provided by the trustee or the associate of the trustee. A trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, must not refuse: to supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person; or to supply, or offer to supply, goods or services to a person at a particular price; or to give or allow, or offer to give or allow, a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation to the supply, or the proposed supply, of goods or services to a person; for the reason that one or more of the employees of the person does not hold, or has not applied or agreed to hold, a superannuation interest provided by the trustee or the associate of the trustee. If: the trustee of a superannuation entity, or an associate of such a trustee, contravenes subsection (1) or (2); and a person suffers loss or damage because of the contravention; the person may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the trustee or the associate of the trustee, as the case may be. The action must be begun within 6 years after the day on which the cause of action arise. This section does not affect any liability under any other provision of this Act or under any other law. Schedule 1, item 67, page 39 (line 9), omit '1999', substitute '2000'. I will speak briefly in support of the amendments. Included within these amendments are amendments that would extend the start date of choice to 1 July 2000 for both new and existing employees. This amendment is widely supported by both people in the superannuation industry and employers, who are dreading the government's policy of having two separate classes of employees. Having two distinct classes of employees - those employed before 1 July 1999 and those employed after - is entirely inconsistent with the government's argument for wanting to do away with award based superannuation. As we have seen so many times before, the government has an inconsistent position and argument on superannuation. We want to do a favour for the government, employees, employers and superannuation funds by moving amendments which will align the start date for the government's so-called superannuation choice for new and existing employees. We think that the start date ought to be the same, and it ought to be 1 July 2000. The whole superannuation industry has called for this extension of time, including the peak superannuation body, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. We also have amendments which revise the definition of `industry based fund'. This amendment replaces the government's definition of industry based fund with a definition which more accurately reflects what a true industry based fund is. This amendment will apply only in the case where, under the government's model, an employer chooses to offer his or her employees the four choice of funds offer - where an employee will have to choose one of four funds. It does that by requiring a fund which seeks to qualify under this definition of an industry based fund to be a not-for-profit fund which operates purely in the best interests of the members of that fund. Amendments in this package relate to the removal of clause 32X, which overrides federal awards. These amendments go to the heart of the entire choice of superannuation debate. The overriding of award based superannuation entitlements, which is what the government is proposing here and in legislation we debated yesterday, is really what the government is all about. The effect of Labor's amendment is to remove 32X from the government's bill, which would otherwise override federal awards. This is hypocritical. Clause 32W says that awards will not be overridden for the purposes of determining notional earnings bases on which to base an employee's superannuation contributions. The reason for this is that, if the award provisions are overridden, em ployers will lose the basis on which to determine an employee's salary for superannuation purposes because that is contained in awards. That means that some employees could choose a fund that would require greater contributions than they are presently receiving. That, in turn, would cost employers more. Surprise, surprise! The government has decided that it wants to do something about this, presumably following lobbying from employer representatives. They say, `We're going to insert a clause which says, 'Well, even though the award no longer applies for superannuation purposes, we'll pretend that it still does just so employers won't be liable to pay any more than they currently are liable to pay.'' We are also moving amendments relating to the default fund option. Because of the complexity of the government's choice of fund model the default fund arrangements are crucial, so we are moving amendments in that area. We are also moving amendments concerning the avoidance of commission based sales under the choice regime. We do not want to see the sorts of things that occurred in places like Chile and, indeed, in the UK. These amendments are designed to try to ensure that that does not happen. We are moving amendments that concern the need for superannuation funds to be year 2000 compliant and, finally, we have an amendment concerning third line forcing provisions - once again, a very important one. If employers are not discouraged from entering into third line forcing arrangements with other parties, the retirement incomes of many Australians will suffer. Having said that in support of the amendments, I hope the House will support them for the benefit of the retirement incomes of thousands of Australian working men and women."
