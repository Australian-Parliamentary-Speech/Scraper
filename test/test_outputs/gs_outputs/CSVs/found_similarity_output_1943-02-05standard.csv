"F4U","I know what I am talking about. The members of that mysterious body are chosen by means known only to honorable members opposite, and it is significant that Sir Sydney Snow was seen within the precincts of this Parliament whenever any important legislation was being passed through this Parliament during the term of office of the previous Government. Honorable members should contrast the mysteriously appointed consultative council of the United Australia party with the democratically controlled Labour conferences, which give a fair cross-section of the views of the working people of Australia. The consultative council in its composition is the very antithesis of the Labour conferences. This bill authorizes the utilization of the services of members of the Citizen Military Forces in the South-western Pacific Zone, as outlined by the Prime Minister in the light of the following considerations : - The strategical set-up in the South-west Pacific Area; the objectives of global strategy in their particular relation to the South-west Pacific Area; the nature of the forces required for operations in the Pacific areas; the strength of the Australian naval, land and air forces available for commitments and for co-operation, not only in the South-west Pacific Area, but in other theatres as well; and Australia's manpower resources and the maximum forces they are capable of maintaining in the field, in tropical warfare. Another significant statement in the Prime Minister's speech must be borne in mind when determining whether the Government's proposals go far enough. The right honorable gentleman said -","17"
"F4U","I believe that to be so. We are in constant danger of attack, and any person who underestimates the Japanese is doing a great disservice to Australia. The Japanese have suffered some small setbacks, but their population numbers 80,000,000 and they have a further 20,000,000 people under their domination. They are preparing for the day when they will strike back. The areas that they have lost are very small, and I have no doubt that they will endeavour at. the earliest opportunity to recapture them. When one considers how they have spread their tentacles across the South-west Pacific, it is obvious that although they have been pushed back at certain points, they will come again. Any one who lulls himself into a sense of complacency by the belief that we shall receive no more shocks from the Japanese is, knowingly or unknowingly, doing a great disservice to this country. As a member of the Advisory War Council and of War Cabinet I can assure all members that we are in constant danger of further attack. It must be remembered tha-t Australia is a long way from centres of allied population. In order to make our maximum contribution to the allied cause, to minimize demands upon allied shipping, and to use our fighting forces with the fullest effect, Australia must envisage the maximum use of its troops in the areas most accessible to them, Both inside and outside the South-western Pacific Zone. The passage of this bill will enable this . to be done. Our proximity to the Pacific front lines calls upon us inevitably for a greater proportion of our man-power than that which any of our allies, with the possible exception of New Zealand, can possibly contribute to the common cause. If the demands be greater upon us than upon our allies we must remember also that our peril is greater and therefore we must put forward a greater effort to save ourselves. I emphasize that in making the Australian Imperial Force available for world-wide service, Australia is contributing to the allien cause a proportion of its man-power greater than that which any other allied country, with the exception of New Zealand, can possibly send outside its own territory. In addition to the Australian Imperial Force, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy we are also contributing the Citizen Military Forces for service within the area that is most vital to the defence of the Commonwealth, namely, the South-western Pacific Zone, outlined by the Prime Minister. Nobody will question that it is preferable in every respect to defend Australia in the adjacent islands rather than to allow the Japanese to land in this country and fight on Australian soil. Our national peril demands the most effective use of all our forces, and that necessitates all our forces being made available for use in the South-western Pacific Zone. That is apparent from an elementary analysis of the position. Members of the Australian Imperial Force are all front-line troops, and can be most effectively used in the front, line. Our citizen forces include a proportion of troops fit for frontline service and a proportion, who although not fit for the front line, are capable of carrying out useful work on lines of communicatioin. Members of our citizen forces who are fit for frontline service can be used most effectively in the front line in areas, that are within the ambit of the provisions of this bill-. This measure makes these men available for service in the South-western Pacific Zone which will be Australia's front line for a long time to come. As the allied forces advance and reconquer enemy-occupied territory our lines of communication will extend to those territories, and the demand for men for service on lines of communication duties will increase correspondingly. For that purpose this bill will make available military personnel who, although unfit for the front line, can operate efficiently on lines of communication. Every advance into enemyoccupied territory will increase the demand not only for lines of communication personnel, but also for troops capable of undertaking front-line service to hold the territory gained and to repel any counterattacks which may be launched, because it must be remembered that our task consists not only of recapturing enemy occupied territory but also of holding it when it is recaptured. Does any honorable member believe that victory in the South-west Pacific can be purchased cheaply? I say plainly and without hesitation that our militia forces will not be sufficiently numerous for the work required of them in the South-western Pacific Zone, and that if and when the Australian Imperial Force proceeds beyond that zone our manpower resources will be so depleted that we shall be obliged to secure the further assistance of allied personnel to help hold the reconquered territory. Obviously it is a physical impossibility for any country to send all its military forces outside its own territory. Remembering that when honorable members opposite occupied the. treasury bench they repeatedly pledged themselves not to extend the area in which our citizen forces could be used beyond Australian territories, and knowing that the despatch overseas of all Australia's military forces would be a physical impossibility as well as strategically unwise, why does the Opposition demand that thisGovernment shall do what they themselves refused to do and what they kno w to be impossible?","17"
"F4U","The Australian Imperial Force is numerically stronger than the Militia in Australia to-day. The Opposition, apparently, lost sight of that fact. After hearing them one would think that we had only a few thousand men in the Australian Imperial Force and the remainder in the Militia, but not allowed to go outside Australia.","17"
"KNX","All that the Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde) has said is, no doubt, very interesting, but it would be much more impressive to honorable members on this side did we not know that the Minister has a hard job to square the statements which he has just made with those that have been made on other occasions by the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin). I strongly suspected that, while the Minister was appealing to honorable members not to indulge in party politics with regard to this proposal, he was speaking with his tongue in his cheek. His whole speech savoured- of party politics. Therefore, before I deal with the bill itself, I shall correct some of his statements. He took to task the Government of which I was a member with regard to its war effort. In effect, he said no good could come out of Israel; that what we had done was of no moment, that we had made a complete mess of the whole show, and that honorable members opposite, as the saviours of this country, had assumed office in the very nick of time. I point out that the Minister, when in Opposition, was a member of the Advisory War Council. I ask the House not to forget that. As a member of that body, he, and his colleagues as well, must have known the exact state of affairs at that time. With that knowledge, he subscribed to what had been done by the previous Government. On the 28th May, 1941, the Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, declared in this House -","17"

"JY7","A few of them. I am not suggesting that we should send troops to Russia. These matters are not managed in that way. In the last war, our troops on Gallipoli neutralized a tremendous number of enemy troops. It is claimed by men who know what they are talking about that they thereby played a very important part in the- winning of the war. Their particular show - if I may use the expression - was not in itself successful, but it was most successful in its effects on the other operations of war. I have no objection to Australian troops being sent to any part to which the Government considers that they should be sent. I repeat, that when operations of this sort are being undertaken, secrecy is essential. There should be the power to send troops anywhere, without notification of the fact by the issue of a proclamation, without placarding it through the press or in any other way. Attack should be possible without reference of the matter to Parliament in order to ascertain its views. How can Parliament have a knowledge of the whole of the details? Therefore, I say, let any Commonwealth Government have full power to send troops wherever it may consider they should be sent in the general interests of the war. When I say, ' the war ', I do not mean the general interests of Australia so mud as the general interests of the Allies ir the winning of the war. What will the Dutch think of us - those people who have been most grossly betrayed? I do not know whether honorable member, have read a work entitled, The Rape of the Netherlands, by E. N. van Kleffens who was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands Government, in which he describes how the Dutch after the last war took a lot of German children who were suffering from rickets and other complaints, fed them for years, and saw that they were preserved in a normal state of health. When this war broke out, it was learned that a lot of those children not only had been engaged in espionage, but became active spies against the nation which had befriended them during a1' those years. What are the Dutch likely to think of people who are not prepared to stand up to their great indebtedness? What about the countries that have been overrun and are awaiting release - Norway, Poland, which has been ravaged in a way that is almost unknown in modern times; Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, in which the people of a whole village are taken as hostages and later are shot, the village being razed to the ground, because of the shooting of one German officer? That is total war. That is what one has to think of when dealing with a bill of this character; not of pushing a zone a few miles farther out, saying to the Australian Imperial Force troops, 'Fall in', and to the Citizen Military Forces troops, ' Fall out '. I do not know the meaning of the word ' global ' if that be global war. I have one claim to a right to speak about the people of the nations to which I have just referred. Through no merit of my own I happened to have been brought up, to some degree, on the other side of the world, and I have returned to Europe on numerous occasions. For many years I have been greatly interested in foreign affairs, and I have visited Great Britain, not merely to see and enjoy the beauties of the homeland, and the qualities of its people, great as they are, but also to follow up my study of foreign affairs. With the possible exception of one honorable member, I suppose that I have visited more European countries .than anybody else in this chamber. I was in Spain a few months before King Alfonso left the throne, and I visited Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria where I had been earlier in 1937. I have visited all parts of Europe from Holland to Italy and Sicily. I do not pretend to know so much about the United States of America, although I have visited that country a couple of times. I have a fair idea of what the people of those overseas countries are thinking now about some of the things that have been done in Australia. I know the people of Great Britain so well that it is not necessary for me to write and ask them what they think about Australia. They do not approve what has been done here, but they do not say so. There are other people, however, who do not like our attitude, and will say so. Australia, with its huge territory and small population, should take thought to make some friends for itself in the world. Some years ago, Mr. Crofts, a respected member of the Australian Labour party, was one of our delegates to the International Labour Conference at Geneva, and on his return to Australia he confessed his surprise to have found that Australians seemed to be unpopular overseas. The reason why the people of other countries do not like us is that we are selfish. That is the position in a nutshell. The bill before the House is no merger whatever. Ever since the last war I have been in favour of conscription. I had over three years' experience in that war, and I observed that the supply of reinforcements was constantly falling off. The best of our men had already gone to the front and many of them had paid the supreme sacrifice. Many others gradually joined up. They were not intimadated so much as shamed into enlisting, but they did well. I do not believe that there is any specific bravery in one man as compared with another, except in a few isolated cases. Some men seem to have a valour that is undaunted in any circumstances, but others simply ' cannot take it '. They are essentially timid - perhaps for some psychological reason. The average man, after having gone through the initial stage of war service, is just as good as the next. I think that it is all wrong that the flower of the manhood of the country should be killed off while others who are not so public-spirited should be left. Under th voluntary system of enlistment, many men conscientiously make up their mindthat their first duty is to their wives and families, and I believe that they would be devoutly thankful if their right to choose between service at the front and remaining at home were taken from them. Conscription provides the only means by which reinforcements can regularly be provided. The Prime Minister referred to Field Marshal Smuts. Think of the tremendous task that that notable statesman has had to deal with because of the disloyalty in South Africa. If any statesman in colonial history has deserved well of his nation, or of the British Commonwealth of '.Nations, it is he, as reference to the quarterly articles on South Africa in The Round Table during this war will show. . The area of Africa is four time3 that of Australia, although the white population of the Union of South Africa is only about 2,000,000 as against our 7,000,000. Australia could be taken up and dumped down in the Sahara and Libyan deserts. I consider that Field Marshal Smuts has put up a superb performance. Has any honorable member been able to foretell how this war would develop, or to what parts of the world it would extend? There have been great surprises. The battle on the European front may not be decided first, but all the indications are that it will be. Great Britain and the United States of America have said that they will then throw their full weight into the struggle in the Pacific area. Are Australian troops to remain in this area, or are they to fight alongside the troops of Great Britain? Are we to expect the United States of America to wage the warfare that may be necessary beyond the zone fixed by this bill? If the Government desires power to fight this war to the finish, it should take full power now. That is why I support the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Barker, than whom no man in this House has more frequently pointed out the dangers in which this country stands, and in which it may find itself in future. In the last war Great Britain adopted conscription, and by that means its troops were reinforced. Australia did not apply conscription, with the result that its soldiers had to fight on without receiving the leave that they needed. Does any one stand for that? Well, I do not. In the last war it was found that the effective fighting life of a man in the line was not much more than two and a half years. There were some very phlegmatic men who might be able to last as long as three years, or more, but there were others who fell sick and had to be sent out after a much shorter time than two and a half years. My recollection is that, in the Royal Air Force, men were ' grounded ' after eighteen months. That was in the last war, and we know that the strain is much greater on men in this war. We have not been there to see, but we have read of what the men have to go through. The Papuan campaign, in which our men have been engaged, was probably as difficult as any campaign could be. Are we to ask the men who have fought through such conditions to go on fighting until they are either killed or so maimed that they cannot fight any more? That would be an unworthy request to make. Here are a few instances of how the war is hitting some people. I know of a widow who had six sons, of whom one is a youth below military age. The other five enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and three of them have been killed. The mother received notice of the death of two of them in the same week. Within the last few weeks I have had the unhappy duty of writing to three of my friends who have each lost two sons. In two of those instances those were the only sons the parents had. Another friend of mine, whose son was lost flying in Africa, told me that out of 70 young men who had gone away as pilots at the same time as his son, 63 were either dead or missing - and that was some months ago. Are we to do nothing to ensure that men are available to take their places? Are the same men to be put into the line time after time, and no attempt made to spare them? 1 know of one young officer who was badly wounded in North Africa. He was brought back to Australia, and, when he recovered, was sent to Papua. He was wounded there, and brought back to Australia for a few weeks leave, after which he was sent to New Guinea again, where he has been wounded a third time, ls he to be sent back again and again until he is killed? I know that it is impossible to fight a war without losses. Every soldier knows that, but I believe it to be a monstrous system under which the public-spirited men who enlist in the defence of their country must face all the danger, while others are left behind. The only reasonable thing to do is to spread the risk - which probably means the casualties - over the whole of the population insofar as we can. The Government will probably ask - where we are to get the men? No doubt we shall be reminded of the dearth of man-power, something of which most of us were aware a good while ago. I began discussing it with the then Minister for Labour and National .Service in February of last year, when I pointed, out that, unless great care was taken, the country areas would be denuded of labour. The question then arises, where are we to get men for the relief of those already in the fighting forces? 'Well, there are too many men working in industrial concerns at the present time. In South Australia, I should think, there are between 20,000 and 30,000 young men, single and physically fit, working in industrial concerns.","17"
"L0G","There have been some bad reports about Australia. Unfortunately there is no means of verifying these reports, but they get about. I am afraid ultimately somebody will have to have some courage and put these things in such a tactful but firm way that the relationships between the two countries are, in the public mind, improved. We are so blooming polite in this country, so I am told, that we do not say just what we should, and I have been advised by some Australians over here that it would do good if we were to speak out at times. However, the job that individuals can do is to deal with these dissensions when they arise in the spirit that while they quite likely may have foundation it is a waste of time to go into them, and that our job is to win the war and afterwards to work together. You would be astonished to know that there are some quite intelligent people in the City of London who think that Australians are going to work in with Americ a, and only be attached to this country in a sentimental way. Personally, I believe there is no reason why the relationship should be other than good after the war, provided there is a, frank exchange of views, and where there is a tendency to boast and throw undue weight about, to rub in some of the failures of the past.","17"
"KA9","I understand that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is giving consideration to entering into a new contract for the printing of the A.B.C. Weekly. I therefore take this opportunity to urge upon the Government the advisability of its giving consideration to the wisdom of continuing the publication of this journal which, as I have recently ascertained, is continuing to show a huge loss. In the year ended the 30th June, 1942, the total expenditure was ?46,000 and the revenue - advertising and sales- ?17,041, a loss of ?28,959 per annum, or over ?550 a week. But that is not the worst feature. This journal was published to -provide listeners with the programmes, but as a matter of fact only 3 per cent, of licence-holders subscribe to the journal. So. from that point of view, the journal is indeed a futile experiment. At least a dozen journals are published in Australia to supply the same information as is contained in the A. B.C. Weekly. It might be worth while if the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr. Dedman) paid the same attention to this activity as he has paid to many others in this country. I am concerned about the waste of money, for how can we expect the people to heed our appeals for austerity when we continue to squander not only money but also materials and man-power in the publication of this journal?","17"

"JLZ","Knowing your interest in the wellbeing of former residents of New Guinea,I am taking the liberty of approaching you in regard to the question of War Damage Insurance as it affects us. Throughout the conduct of my negotiations with the CommissionI have regarded mine as a test case so that I could pass on the benefit of my experience to those who are in like circumstances. After some correspondence with the Commission,I had an interview with Mr. Gronin, State Superintendent of Claims in New South Wales, who asked me to submit a statutory declaration to support my claim, also to obtain others from persons who were aware of conditions at Lae and of happenings there on 21st January, 1942, and afterwards. I.did so and submitted them to the Commission together with a letter from Burns Philp and Co. regarding thetransport of my effects fromRabaul to Lae and marine insurance. I received a communication from the Commission dated 27th November, 1942, which, interalia, stated: 'I have to advise that the Commission is satisfied that the evidence submitted by yon indicates on examination, support for the sum of £208 10s. and that the damage was 'war damage'. This, in the opinion of the Commission,carries your claim as near to finality as can be reached at this juncture. . . . The foregoing statements are without prejudice to the right of the Commission to review, for the Commission is not disposed to formally admit liability and assess and record your claim until it is possible to inspect the damage and secure such further informationas may be procurable in the territory.' I was not altogether satisfied with this reply and asked if my claim could not be recorded. The reply was : ' As mentioned in my previous letter, the Commission is not, at this stage, prepared to record your claim.' No direct reply was given to my question. I am of the opinion that the Commission's ruling leaves much to be desired. I have furnished them with the best evidence available, that of eye-witnesses. Apparently at a distant date in the future, some one will visit the territory to assess the damage (in all probability a person to whom New Guinea is but a name) and conduct inquiries on the spot. The evidence he will receive will be hearsay only. He will have to rely for his information on whoever happens to be in the particular area at the moment. The person or persons may not have been there when the damage took place, and any information gained from such a course would not be first-hand nor comparable with evidence such as I and others have submitted.","17"
"KX7","The honorable member implied that costs were mounting because of the payment of overtime to the workers. I ask the House to bear in mind that the workers are now obliged to work overtime and are thereby subject to industrial fatigue. They are, therefore, already making a great sacrifice in working long hours. Further, honorable members opposite are now advocating that the lower paid workers should be brought within the income tax field. To-day, the workers find that although they are working longer hours, and the amount they receive in wages is higher, they are faced with rising living costs, and, directly and indirectly, are paying more in taxes. Consequently, if there is to 'be a review of rising war costs, it should embrace all costs and not be confined merely to the wages of the workers. For instance, the Government should give prompt attention to the profits which are being earned by private enterprise in the carrying out of war contracts.","12"
