"N/A","The honorable member for Parramatta has referred to an interjection which I made last night. The honorable member attributed to me a statement which I have never made - a statement which, although it may be true, was not made by me, either in this House or outside of it - and (I trust that when I have concluded my remarks, he will see fit to withdraw such an unwarrantable accusationn .","17"

"KED","It has been complained that consideration is not given to the wire-netting industry in New South Wales, but those who make that complaint seem to forget that the Federal Tariff affects people equally all over Australia. This particular industry was established by a firm who have an agency here, and wish to meet their own requirements. There has been no duty on wire netting in 'Victoria up to the present time, and in this State there has been a small factory established. I am confident that the duty will not add Id. to the cost of barbed wire. Although there may not be a great many people employed in the industry, still there are some, and where there is a chance of giving employment without enhancing the cost to the consumer, I shall support such a duty as will preserve the industry from extinction.","17"

"F4R","I want to draw attention to the necessity of having something like an equitable arrangement as between type and machines which take the place of type. Further, I should like to direct attention to a difficulty which presents itself if a tax, or, at any rate, a high tax, is placed on the various things which printers are compelled to use. It is apparent that for many years, or, at any rate, for some years, very few of these things can be locally manufactured in sufficient quantities to bring the price down to a parity with that obtaining outside the Commonwealth. ' Local printers, when tendering or quoting for the publication of books within the Commonwealth, will be at a disadvantage as compared with German or American printers, who are willing to quote for works which come into the Commonwealth free, and which none of us desire to see taxed in any shape. These are, it may be, medical works, scientific works, or ordinary works of fiction. At present a considerable and increasing number of these are published locally, and it would not be fair to offer a premium to any person requiring the publication of such works to go to America or Germany. I know that in Sydney travellers and representatives of firms in those countries are quoting for all classes of printing, and in quite a number of instances large jobs of ordinary book work and advertisements have gone abroad. I admit the Government have made some attempt to assist local manufacturers so far as advertising matter is concerned, but that attempt, I take it, will be comparatively ineffective. There are magazines, such as the Strand and Pearson's, and quite a number of others, which come in ostensibly as literature, but which are sometimes loaded with advertisements to the extent of two-thirds of their total contents. The Treasurer shakes his head, but as a purchaser of such books every month, I am certain that a good deal more than half is made up of advertisements. The point I should like the Government to consider is whether it would not be practicable, if they want revenue, to put a small all-round duty on the things which printers use. If they impose a revenue duty of, say, 5 per cent., I shall not object. But I could not agree to a duty of 10 per cent. or more on the things which printers use, and the using of which will place them at a disadvantage with foreign competitors. In addition to that, it would be improper to make any distinction in the rate of taxation between machines and the type which is necessary to hand composition. The two ought to be at least on a parity. While in our present civilization we do not desire to put machinery at a disadvantage, it should not be placed at an advantage as compared with those who are compelled to use manual labour in the various processes of industry. Without submitting any amendment at present, I trust that the Government will give some indication of their general attitude towards this class of importation. Sir MALCOLM McEACHARN (Melbourne). - I move -","17"
"N/A","I trust we have now heard the last of proposals from private members to place such articles as these upon the dutiable list. . The Government no doubt gave a good deal of attention to the subject, and thought fit to place washers and rivets amongst the exemptions, and a strong case will have to be made out from a protectionist's point of view before the amendment can be accepted. Is it the intention of the Government to accept the amendment?","17"
"N/A","E. McLEAN (Lang). - There may be a good deal to be said in favour of placing these articles on an equal footing, but I should like to have some information as to the effect of the amendment. Rivets are largely used in the manufacture of boilers, and in the building and repairing of iron vessels, and I should be glad to know how the imposition of a duty may affect these industries. We should be told something of the extent of the present importations, and it would be also be interesting to know whether washers and rivets were exempt under the Victorian Tariff.","17"
"N/A","B. EDWARDS (Sydney).- It is quite plain that if we are going to impose a duty upon bolts and nuts, we ought also to levy one upon washers, which can be manufactured much more easily. It seems extraordinary that the Government did not recognise this fact if they intended to impose a duty upon any of these articles. I should like the Government to put a revenue duty of 10 per cent, upon bolts, nuts, washers, and rivets. I am aware that a duty of 15 per cent, has been placed upon bolts and nuts, but I think that that is too heavy a duty to place upon washers and rivets. In placing a duty upon these articles, we must take care that they are adequately described, because they enter into the manufacture of all sorts of other articles, and it may happen that in assisting the very small factories which are engaged in making them, we may hamper very much larger industries. Rivets are used in the making of waterproof clothing, in the making of boots, and in the making of a great number of other things. It seems to me that we should give more consideration to the question of obtaining revenue, and so long as a duty is light and will not hamper the industry upon which it is imposed, I shall be ready to vote for it. If the honorable member for Melbourne will alter his amendment so as to make the proposed duty upon rivets and washers 10 per cent., I shall be ready to support it.","17"
"N/A","I would point out that although washers and rivets have been made in Victoria without a duty, the industry would have been much more successful if there had been a duty, and it will be exceedingly inconsistent for the committee, having put a duty of 15 per cent, on bolts and nuts, to place rivets and washers upon the free list.","17"
"N/A","COOK (Parramatta).It is a strange thing that the honorable member for Bland can protest against the lobbying of only free-traders. The ACTING CHAIRMAN (Mr. V. L. Solomon). - I must ask the honorable member not to continue this discussion, but to confine himself to the item before the committee.","17"
"N/A","B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). - The honorable member has declined my suggestion to make the duty upon rivets and washers 10 per cent., with a view of getting the Government to recommit bolts and nuts and make them 10 per cent. An Honorable Member. - That would never do.","17"
"N/A","B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). - If we had an assurance that the Government would recommit the duty on bolts and nuts we might allow this amendment to pass.","12","17"
