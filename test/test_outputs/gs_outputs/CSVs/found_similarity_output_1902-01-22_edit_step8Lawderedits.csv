"009LR","The answer to the honorable member's questions is as follows -","17"
"N/A","The honorable member for Parramatta has referred to an interjection which I made last night. The honorable member attributed to me a statement which I have never made - a statement which, although it may be true, was not made by me, either in this House or outside of it - and (I trust that when I have concluded my remarks, he will see fit to withdraw such an unwarrantable accusationn .","17"
"KXO","What has this to do with barbed wire?","12"
"KED","I am not in a position to say.","12"
"KYD","Yes.","12"
"N/A","Tommy rot!","17"
"N/A","The gentlemen who are chiefly interested in this industry evidently knew their business when they intrusted it to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, and it is with reference to his statement of their case particularly that I wish to address myself. The honorable member has stated that this industry was established during the operation of the Dibbs Tariff in New South Wales - a statement which has been contradicted by other honorable members who have definite information that it was started fifteen years ago, or four years prior to the introduction of the Dibbs Tariff. Then again that Tariff was operative for only three years, so that the industry had existed in New South Wales under a free-trade policy for twelve years. Yet we are now asked to believe that it has been languishing during the whole of that period, and that its proprietors have been making a heavy loss.","17"
"N/A","I trust we have now heard the last of proposals from private members to place such articles as these upon the dutiable list. . The Government no doubt gave a good deal of attention to the subject, and thought fit to place washers and rivets amongst the exemptions, and a strong case will have to be made out from a protectionist's point of view before the amendment can be accepted. Is it the intention of the Government to accept the amendment?","17"
"N/A","I would point out that although washers and rivets have been made in Victoria without a duty, the industry would have been much more successful if there had been a duty, and it will be exceedingly inconsistent for the committee, having put a duty of 15 per cent, on bolts and nuts, to place rivets and washers upon the free list.","17"
"N/A","The same point is arrived at by following the course we have adopted of putting the proposal for the lower duty first. In order to allow that to be clone the honorable member for Melbourne has withdrawn his amendment, and the amendment of the honorable member for South Sydney is now before the Chair.","17"
"N/A","It is only temporarily withdrawn, in order that the honorable member for South Sydney may move his amendment.","17"
"N/A","The honorable member has not intimated anything of the kind.","17"
