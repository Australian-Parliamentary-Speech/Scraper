"10000","Order! I assure honourable members that I intend to celebrate the tranquility of the House today. The facts are that only 12 questions have been asked but I think everyone will agree that three of the questions were very pertinent and necessitated long answers. I do not think anybody would begrudge detailed answers being given in regard to the floods in Queensland and northern New South Wales. I think the question asked of the Minister for Labour necessitated a long answer to enlighten the House as to what hap ape ned. I appeal to Ministers to be as brief as possible when they answer questions in future because I would hope to attain at least 16 questions a day. The question now being answered is only the twelfth today. The appeal by the Leader of the Opposition is simply a matter for the Prime Minister."
"10000","I wish to inform the House that the following members have been nominated as members of the Select Committee on Road Safety: Mr Cohen, Mr Innes, Dr Klugman and Mr McKenzie have been nominated by the Prime Minister; Mr Fox and Mr Hamer have been nominated by the Leader of the Opposition; and Mr Katter has been nominated by the Leader of the Australian Country Party."
"N/A","Third Reading"
"N/A","That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of Her Majesty the Queen be agreed to: MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN: We, Your Majesty's loyal subjects, the Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, desire to thank you for the Gracious Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. The presence in Australia of Your Majesty and of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip has once again brought the greatest pleasure to Your Australian people. We, their representatives in this House, are grateful for this opportunity to re-affirm our allegiance to you as our Queen."
"KM9","The Country Party introduced them. There are still people on wheat quotas. We were told by a member of the Country Party tonight about the starving millions of the world, yet the Liberal-Country Party Government in New South Wales has people on a wheat quota and refuses to give them permission to produce wheat. How laughable. There is one basis and one basis only for a comparison between the policies of this Government and the previous government and their effect on primary industries, and that is in terms of income to primary producers. Every primary producer in Australia will tell us today that he is far better off than he was before. He is far better off under a Labor Government than he has been for years under an anti-Labor administration. I should like to make a few brief references now to constitutional proposals for the future. The Government proposes to ask the Australian people to approve of various amendments to the Constitution by way of referendums at the time of the next Senate election. The first of these proposals is to allow an amendment to the Constitution to ensure that Senate elections are held at the same time as House of Representatives elections - a reform designed to correct the position created by Sir Robert Menzies when Prime Minister, which requires an election each year. Mr Whitlam, the Prime Minister of Australia, as Leader of the Opposition before the last election, promised that the Government would take action on this matter. People are sick and tired of going to an election each year. They have a State election one year, a House of Representatives election the next year, and a Senate election the next. But this situation has not concerned honourable members opposite. They have carried on under these co nations for years. They have even gone to the extent now of opposing not only the principle of allowing the referendums to go to the people but also the Bills which will allow the people to have their say. Honourable members opposite do not want the people to have their say. Why should the Senate election not be held at the same time as the House of Representatives election?"

"N/A","(The document read as follows) - 1.I am a member of the Australian Society of Accountants, the person who carried out the detailed work on the audits of C. J. Hurford & Co., Chartered Accountants, under the supervision of Mr Hurford and others, and the person mentioned by Hr Hall, M.P., in his statement in the South Australian Parliament on 26 February 1974. I associate myself completely with Mr Hurford 's statement concerning Mr Hall's baseless attack on us. 2.In his statement about the audit of the Storemen and Packers' Union, South Australian Branch, Mr Hall attributed to me (a) that I had indicated that there was no misappropriation and that debts were due to the overspending of union funds, (b) that I had given the advice 'You can't call the police in', but that I had retracted this and had used the words to Mr Jack Petrie, Federal Secretary of the Storemen and Packers' Union, 'There's no doubt someone is tickling the peter and we both know who it is', and (c) that later I had advised that the former secretary of the South Australian Branch of the Union should be dealt with severely but this should be done without police intervention. These statements of Mr Hall 's are absolutely false and I deny them completely. 3.The facts are that (i) I attended a meeting of the Branch Management Committee in January 1973 by invitation, (ii) At no time did I give advice as to whether or not there had been a misappropriation because I had insufficient evidence and could only state what is public knowledge in the published auditors' reports, (iii) My only intervention related to the tendering of advice concerning the rules of the branch which had been registered under the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Act and this advice did on one occasion in the meeting result in the rewording of a resolution, (iv) I have verified these facts by examining the Minutes of the Branch and my own record of what took place at the Branch Committee Meeting written the day after the meeting. 4. Mr Hall made no attempt to check the facts with me. Because he will not repeat his charges outside the Parliament where their truthfulness can be tested in the Courts, he has caused me personal damage in a cowardly way for his own base political motives. J.H. DOYLE 11 March 1974."
