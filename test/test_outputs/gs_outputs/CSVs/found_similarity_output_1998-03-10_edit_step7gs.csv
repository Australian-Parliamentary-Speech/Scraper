"CT4","That is tomorrow's allegation, is it? Can I make it clear what is important in relation to Australia as we confront this external challenge—a challenge which Australia has not had to confront in the last couple of decades. All the time during the last couple of decades, regardless of what was happening in the Australian economy, Asia was an impetus to growth. Even when Labor had the Australian economy in recession in 1990, 1991 and 1992, Asia was still a stimulus.","17"
"CT4","This is the first time in the last two decades that Asia will not be a stimulus to the Australian economy. What that means is that we have to work as hard as ever to secure the Australian economic situation. The first thing we have to do is deliver on our historic commitment to take the Australian budget out of the red and put it back into the black. This is a very important part of an economic strategy to face the emerging crisis. That means that all of the unfunded promises that are now being made in the name of the Australian Labor Party are utterly irresponsible in the face of an external challenge of the dimension that we are facing. Every day the Leader of the Opposition walks into parliament, he makes another unfunded promise. It is almost as if there is a bit of magic when he goes through those doors. He talked this morning as he came in about $1.7 billion in relation to health: 'Whipping $1.7 billion out is basically taking it out of the states one way or another, so they certainly need that put back with an appropriate set of terms.' That is what he said this morning. He made a $1.7 billion unfunded promise just this morning, which you can put together with all of his other unfunded promises in relation to foreign aid, in relation to nursing homes, in relation to R&D syndicates and in relation to all of the tax dodgers. All of these are unfunded promises which would be utterly irresponsible in the face of the current situation. What else does Australia need to do in the face of the current situation? Let me make this point. For an island nation whose exports go out through ports and wharfs nothing could be more damaging to the Australian economy than a sclerotic waterfront that has restrictive work practices and that operates in an unproductive way. What do we see? The Australian Labor Party would choke the lifeblood of the Australian economy because it will not support reform on Australia's waterfront. Nothing could be more irresponsible than for the Labor Party to give comfort to those who want to make Australia uncompetitive. The Labor Party should join this government to support waterfront reform. What else do we need to do in the face of the external challenge? In the face of the external challenge nothing could be more important to Australia than tax reform. Why would we sit back complacently like the Australian Labor Party and say that we will imbed indirect taxes into our exports at a time when our exports are struggling on world markets? What could be more complacent than that? Yet the Australian Labor Party say there is no need to reform our taxation system. They say there is no need to take the fundamental restructuring which is required in Australia to get the Australian economy going again.","17"
"BT4","Mr Speaker","17"
"7T4","On a point of order, Mr Speaker","17"
"BT4","I thank the member for Prospect for her question. I have read the letter from Sister Mary-Louise. I have also had Sister Mary-Louise's views conveyed to me by the member for Lindsay. Sister Mary-Louise has provided good services to unemployed people in the electorate of Lindsay for a long time. I am naturally sympathetic to Sister Mary-Louise because in the end the bid that she did submit was not competitive compared with those that were accepted for that area.","17"
"BT4","In the letter there were a number of factual inaccuracies. I am happy to put the facts on the record for Sister Mary-Louise in relation to the increasing assistance which unemployed people will be getting in St Marys. First of all, unemployed people will have access to the services of Mission Australia in St Marys, which will be able to assist hundreds of long-term unemployed people to get jobs in a way which will be tailored to their individual needs.","17"
"BT4","Our responsibility in the end is to the unemployed people of this country. Our responsibility is to help in the best possible way that we can those people who are most disadvantaged. It is no criticism of someone who has been offering services for a long time to say that the government has received a better plan to help unemployed people in that area. In addition to that the government has contracted other providers within the general St Marys area who will be assisting over 2,000 unemployed people. Anyone who is unemployed in St Marys will be able to go to those other providers as well. So they will have for the first time a choice of a number of agencies to provide them with help in filling job vacancies.","17"
"BT4","Let me return to the point that I made before. If all we are going to hear from the Labor Party are the views of those who have not got contracts in this tender round—a very high quality tender round with lots of excellent proposals—all it will do is underline to the people of Australia that the Labor Party has no constructive plan whatever to help unemployed people. The only people in this country who are putting forward a creative, innovative, soundly based plan to help the unemployed people in this country are the coalition. You are a policy vacuum. When you were the Leader of the House, you added 95,000 to the ranks of the long-term unemployed. You failed as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. You are failing as the Leader of the Opposition. It is up to the coalition to put forward these constructive people to help people in this country.","17"
"ZD4","As honourable members will be aware, in the 1997 budget the government announced the allocation of $1,000 million into a fund designed to mark the centenary of the federation of the Australian nation. The bulk of that money was to be committed towards major projects of lasting national significance and benefit. Many of these projects will generate large numbers of jobs in the construction phase and they will make a very valuable and ongoing contribution to Australia, to Australia's infrastructure and to the Australian economy. Already the following Federation Fund projects have been announced: the National Museum of Australia, which includes the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies to be constructed in Canberra at a cost of $147 million; the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, which has attracted a commitment of $100 million and I remind the House that that was promised by Bob Hawke in 1983 and for 13 years Labor did nothing about it. I know, they were going to do it in the 14th year of course they were! I do them a disservice. Also out of the Federation Fund we are making a contribution to that magnificent building, the National Gallery of Victoria. When I was in Western Australia on the Australia Day weekend, I had the opportunity of announcing, with the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, a contribution of $80 million to the Jervoise Bay infrastructure project which, I point out, unless my geography deserts me, is in the electorate of the honourable member for Fremantle. Could I be wrong? Could she be a Labor member? Indeed, it is in the electorate of the honourable member for Fremantle. Dear, oh dear $80 million. Another project is the Corowa bridge construction, which will be an important and historic link between New South Wales and Victoria of $12 million. Also, my colleague the Minister for Sport and Tourism announced the other day the contribution towards the refurbishment of the historic St Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney of $5 million which will make a very significant contribution, along with an equal amount of Commonwealth subvention for refurbishment of St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney, in the restoration of those very fine buildings. Having recalled what has already been announced, I would like to inform the House of two other important government decisions which carry implications for all honourable members without exception. In relation to $100 million of the Federation Fund","17"
"ZD4","Out of the Federation Fund, there will be an amount of $70 million set aside for medium sized cultural and heritage projects, particularly","17"
"8K6","Another rort!","17"
"ZD4","I have already answered the question raised in relation to married women. Let me make it very clear to the House that the difference between our approach and your approach is that we are offering the unemployed hope and choice. They are two things that you never offered them, because when you were in government you drove unemployment to a post-Depression high. The bloke who now leads your party, the Leader of the Opposition, presided over an unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent. That is the worst unemployment rate that Australia has had since the Great Depression. The same Leader of the Opposition presided over a youth unemployment rate of 32 per cent. All that those opposite can do","17"
"PE4","Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. As much as I hate to interrupt the Prime Minister on auto-gibber, I go for relevance","17"
"PE4","On the question of relevance, the point is this: there was a specific question asked on whether or not the Prime Minister was aware of and accepted the situation that a person who was unemployed but not on benefit","17"
"ZD4","I think he was here when I read out that letter from Employment National. I think that letter from Employment National completely answers it. But, as the honourable member for Batman has given me the opportunity of saying so, let me again remind the House that what we are embarked upon with this new job market scheme is a drive to give to the unemployed of Australia a sense of hope, a sense of optimism and the reality of choice that was never available under the former government. Only the other day, when I was visiting an electorate I was in the electorate of the member for the Northern Territory I had a number of people come up to me. There was a level of enthusiasm within the business community of Darwin that would put even the cynicism of the Labor Party to shame. There was a tremendous sense of hope and optimism. A number of people came up to me and spoke very enthusiastically about the government's new labour market system.","17"
"ZD4","I answered it very specifically yesterday. It is perfectly obvious that all the Labor Party wants to do on this new plan is whinge and carp. I will finish on this note. It is a very interesting piece of double standard on the part of the opposition. When it comes to the Natural Heritage Trust, it is wrong for","17"
"8E4","The honourable member should be aware that, on about 12 October, the Australian Medical Association started what effectively is industrial action in the Hunter in an attempt to increase GP rebates, so if there was any effect on this you would expect to see it in the December quarter figures from last year, which are the last quarterly figures we have.","17"
"8E4","There are 680 general practitioners who live in the Hunter region, with 220 in Newcastle. Of the 680 GPs who live in the Hunter region, it is true that 12 do not bulk-bill at all—eight part-time and four full-time GPs. The rest bulk-bill some or all patients.","17"
"8E4","If you look at the doctors in Newcastle who were the subject of the report, there are 220 GPs in Newcastle. Of these, 36 are not in active practice, so there are 184 doctors practising. Of the 184 doctors, 30 per cent bulk-bill everything30 per cent of all the active doctors in Newcastle bulk-bill 99 or 100 per cent of all their medical services. Of the other doctors, if you look at the overall bulk-billing rate in Newcastle, 77 per cent of all general practice services in the December quarter were bulk-billed. Far from bulk-billing being virtually unobtainable for ordinary families, the fact is that 30 per cent of doctors bulk-bill everything, and 77 per cent of all services are bulk-billed. Out of the 680 doctors in the Hunter, only 12 bulk-bill nothing.","17"
"8E4","The second point that was made on the Today Tonight show related to the incomes of GPs. Dr Mellows said that 'if you look at the average income of GPs, which is reported to be $42,000 a year, you would wonder why people do medicine'. If that were true you would wonder why people would do medicine. I also took out the aggregated figures on incomes for doctors in Newcastle. Some 10 per cent of GPs in Newcastle last year received billings of between $250,000 and $320,000-that is before practice payments of $13,000 to $42,000 a practice, before above schedule fees, before work cover, before medico-legal and before any sessional fees. Far from having an average income of $42,000, general practitioners do rather well. I admit that this is before practice costs, but even after practice costs it is still a very substantial income. I will make a few points on this. I do not mind people earning a high income. The overwhelming majority of doctors are hard working and they work for their money. I do not blame Today Tonight for being duped by a small number of doctors. But it appears that what has happened in this case is that a handful of GPs in Newcastle have got together, decided to take this action and sought media attention for their plight. If this is true, it may constitute collusive behaviour in breach of section 45 of the Trade Practices Act, and I have decided to refer the matter to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, with a request that it be investigated and, if necessary, that action be taken. I make a final point. I have some sympathy with general practitioners in that their rebates have not gone up in the last five years as much as for other doctors. This is because of a decision taken in 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was then Minister for Finance, to half index GP rebates across the forward estimates and in perpetuity. The net effect of this decision has been to take $1.25 per consultation off general practitioner incomes. Far from bleating that you can hardly find a doctor who bulk-bills, the Leader of the Opposition should examine his own motives and realise that it was his decision that has reduced GP incomes by $1.25 per consultation.","17"
"CT4","The member for Werriwa is only too well aware of the social security system. I welcome the support of tax reform by the progressive members of the Australian Labor Party.","17"
"CT4","It is not true that all of the members of the Australian Labor Party are as illiterate on matters of tax as the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition. If you take a family with two children aged seven and four and both parents unemployed and one of the parents goes into the work force and gets a job paying $200 per week, the effect of income tax plus clawback of social security benefits will mean that, out of the $200 they earn a week, that person will receive only $64—an effective marginal tax rate of around 70 per cent of what they actually earn. If they went to get a job getting an additional $150 per week, the take home pay would increase only by $24 a week; that is, they would lose nearly $130 out of the $150 that they earned by going into the work force. Clearly, what this is saying is that the interaction of the income tax system and the social security system is impacting very unfairly on average taxpayers. That is why this government wants to improve the tax system. We think that the tax system is unfair. We cannot understand why the Australian Labor Party defends such an unfair system, why the Australian Labor Party will not join with us and say, 'Taxation reform is necessary in Australia.' We cannot understand why, after 13 years, the Australian Labor Party did nothing about it and, now that they are in opposition again, why they will not join the government in favour of tax reform. There is one side of Australian politics that wants to improve the tax system—one side of Australian politics that wants to make it fairer.","17"
"ZD4","I should be so lucky. In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I have seen a newspaper report, presumably the one that you quoted from. I have not personally had a discussion with Senator Gibson, but let me make it very clear that we, as a coalition in government, are prepared—unlike you—to have a go at reforming Australia's old-fashioned, out-of-date taxation system. We are prepared to have a go. The Liberal and National parties are prepared to put a political commitment down to really try to fix the Australian taxation system. Can I tell you what the Australian people are telling us. If you cared to listen, they would be telling you exactly the same thing. They think the present system is unfair. They want the present system changed and, provided what comes out of the change is in aggregate a fair alternative to the present system, they will embrace it. I laid down five principles when I announced in August last year that we would be going to the next election with an alternative taxation program. This is the crowd that had 13 long years","17"
"ZD4","I was asked a question about the taxation reform designs of my government. I am answering that question by reminding the Australian people that we have the political courage to try to improve an unfair system—Labor does not. We have the political commitment to provide relief to ordinary Australian families—Labor does not. We do not have the track record of having told the Australian people in 1993 that we were against higher levels of indirect tax and then, immediately on getting re-elected on that false promise, jacking up every indirect tax in the country. We are not the party that ran around promising l-a-w tax cuts and then repudiating them.","17"
"ZD4","I want to remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that five principles were laid down when I announced that we were going to have tax reform. I can assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that when our plan is unveiled all of those principles will be met. All I can say to those opposite is: ask me more questions. Ask me questions every day about taxation reform. Every time you ask me a question, it gives me the opportunity to tell the Australian people that we are in favour of having a go at fixing the taxation system and that you are against it.","17"
"VD4","Mr Speaker, on a point of order: The question was to the advice available to him from his own backbench task force","17"
"VD4","The question was","17"
"PE4","Mr Speaker, on a point of order","17"
"WI4","I think all members of the House would be interested to know that the basis of the industrial action being taken by the MUA tomorrow is to take all the rorts and the rip-offs which they today get by allowance and overtime and put all those into a base salary. On top of that, they have got the hide and the greed to ask for a pay increase of $4,500 a year. This is a claim based on greed and vengeance by the MUA which is being supported by none other than the Labor Party. For years, they were responsible for the rorts and the rip-offs on the Australian waterfront, which is one of the contributors to Australia's foreign debt because of its inability to efficiently move goods across the Australian waterfront. Now, by their silence, the Labor Party are sitting, applauding and endorsing the MUA and their campaign of greed and their campaign to maintain the rorts and the rip-offs which are so evident on the Australian waterfront. The wharfies are asking for an extra $90 a week at a cost to the employer of approximately $130 a week per employee. That will add an extra $22½ million to the cost of stevedoring operations in Australia, which is, in effect, another tax being imposed by the MUA on all those goods which go across the Australian waterfront. It is an outrage that this weak Leader of the Opposition, in the face of a guerilla campaign by his mates, is simply incapable of at least showing the leadership to stand up to these people. There is no doubt that the example of the crane driver who is on $90,000 a year but sits on his crane for only 14 hours a week is really starting to hit home. Yesterday, I received a letter from a wharfie in Brisbane. He said: I am truly getting sick of listening and reading about how much we earn for the year and the 14½ hours that I and my colleagues operate the crane and that we earn $90,000. He then set out to correct me. He said that, for the year ending 30 June 1997, he earned $80,414. In the year before, he only earned the average $74,000. Now his mates back in Sydney, with the support of the Labor Party, are asking for another $4,500. In response to the member's question, I can tell him that the average wharfie is on about $74,000 a year and you are lucky to get 30 hours a week out of them in any average week. As a comparison, nurses and policemen—who really do put in for the community—earn something like half that amount. It is a continuing testament to the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition because he is yet to condemn the guerrilla and thuggish tactics of the MUA.","17"
"WI4","I am aware of this closure and the general circumstances, and I understand it is in the member's electorate. Let me say on behalf of the government that, where employers fail to meet their entitlements, the employees are certainly entitled to take action. The Office of the Employment Advocate is available to those employees, as it is to any employees who have been dudded by their employer.","17"
"WI4","He is claiming it is. I honestly have no information whatsoever. But I can say that one of the tasks of the Office of the Employment Advocate is to ensure that the freedom of association provisions of the federal law are observed, and the advocate has been very active in pursuing instances and examples where unions have required people to be members of a union.","17"
"WI4","We had a recent example of this down at Webb Dock where a non-union truck driver attempted to enter the Patrick property. He was prevented by some of your mates from the TWU, and a complaint was lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate that very day. By the end of the day, a non-union truck driver and other persons, regardless of whether or not they were members of a union, were able to access that site. The fact of the matter is that we have a very strong ban on compulsory unionism. The advocate is doing an absolutely excellent job. If you have genuine concerns, instead of making political points, you ought to raise them with me.","17"
"7V5","The confidential document to which the member for Grey refers is, of course, the one that was used by Senator Bolkus at a press conference on Monday, 5 January. That document is one to which access could be given only by a Federal Court order, and the court has informed the government that no such order had been sought or made. Yesterday I pointed out that the Leader of the Opposition's defence of Senator Bolkus using the document—namely, that Senator Vanstone leaked the affidavit—was quite wrong. Yesterday I also pointed out that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's defence of Senator Bolkus—namely, that the material leaked was already in the Daily Telegraph article of Monday, 5 January—was also quite wrong. Let us have a look at what Senator Bolkus says in his own defence. On the 7.30 Report last week Senator Bolkus said that the document was with the media. However, no evidence was offered. Senator Bolkus asserted last week through a spokesman that the document was on the public record and that he regarded it as being in the public domain. There does not seem to be any evidence of that either. The Telegraph article did not refer to the affidavit. At his press conference, which was after the article had appeared, Senator Bolkus read from it. But if the affidavit was already in the media, why did he then say that he could not give it out and he would proceed to read from it off the record? It cannot be mere coincidence that copies of the two pages from which he read and the two passages to which he referred and which were underlined","17"
"VD4","Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I refer you to standing order 146 which says: A question fully answered cannot be renewed. Surely your recollection is the same as mine that yesterday's question and answer are absolutely identical. The Attorney is just repeating himself.","17"
"RH4","Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Given the ruling you just made, I would also draw your attention to the request","17"
"8E4","I thank the honourable member for his question. In the same speech that the Leader of the Opposition made last night, where he was using Today Tonight as his personal research department, he also made claims that the government had taken $1.7 billion from public health, whatever 'public health' means. He amplified that on radio this morning when he somehow defined the fiscal contribution that states have made to the Commonwealth's budget deficit reduction task as public health, which only shows that the Leader of the Opposition has no understanding of how the hospitals run, or no understanding of how financial assistance grants run. The simple fact is that this was made on a voluntary basis by the states as a contribution of $320 million a year. It has nothing to do with public health. It really only shows your foolishness and your buffoonery, and the fact that you are prepared to say or do anything to achieve an end, no matter how false it is.","17"
"8E4","The reason the states were giving this fiscal contribution was that the former Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition, left a $10½ billion deficit that they were prepared to help us address. The second point that the Leader of the Opposition somehow claimed was related to public health was the Commonwealth dental program, announced in the dying days of the 1993 election campaign by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, as a four-year program. Six months early, when the number of claimed or promised cases had been treated, we met the original promise made in the dying days of the 1993 election. We did not keep it going when you, yourself, had not made any promise to keep it going. The third point is that the Leader of the Opposition claims that the PBS is somehow taking from public health programs. This year we are spending $235 million more on the PBS than we did last year, and last year we spent $211 million more than we did in the year before.","17"
"8E4","What we have simply done in the PBS is reorder our priorities for which we make no apologies. We have reordered our priorities to fund higher cost newer drugs. We have reordered our priorities to make sure that these are available in a timely manner rather than merely funding 'me too' drugs. The Leader of the Opposition attempts to claim that we have somehow cut $1.7 billion from health; his figures do not stack up. To note that a fiscal contribution could somehow be taken from public hospitals simply shows he does not have a clue how they work.","17"
"ZD4","That is not a bad achievement; that is a very considerable achievement.","17"
"ZD4","The member for Hotham is engaging in that age old Labor Party tactic: you talk gloom and doom. You talk the Australian economy down. He invites me to talk about employment. I will talk about employment: employment has risen by 145,000 in the last four months. I will talk about investment: business investment in Australia is running at record levels. I will talk about inflation: inflation in Australia is the lowest of any country in the OECD. I will talk about rate of economic growth: our rate of economic growth is equal to or better than any member country of the G7. Let me warm to the task. Let me talk about interest rates.","17"
"WI4","Mr Speaker","12","17"
"3K6","Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to the question of relevance. You cannot on the one hand ask a question which is wide-ranging, has a lengthy introductory statement and invites debate and then complain about lack of relevance and specificity in the minister's response.","17"
"ZD4","Of course it is relevant. Having dealt with employment, having dealt with investment, having dealt with inflation, having dealt with growth, let me deal with interest rates. In just over two years, interest rates have fallen by the equivalent of $300 a month for the average home buyer in Australia. I know that nobody opposite likes to be reminded of this, but that is the equivalent of a wage rise of $100 a week for the average worker. $100 a week for the average worker.","17"
"ZD4","As a result of that, the great majority of the Australian people are simply not going to listen to this talking down of the Australian economy. They are not going to listen to this doomsday talk from those who sit opposite. They are going to recognise quality economic management when they see it.","17"
"DT4","Thank you.","12"
"10000","The honourable member for Hotham will bask in his affected glory but silently.","17"
"GT4","Another very important point is that this announcement fulfils yet another coalition election promise to deliver faster anti-dumping mechanisms. I have been interested in the interjections from the honourable member for Hotham. He has been running around the countryside telling us how slow and ineffective the current mechanisms are. Senator Murphy has been echoing that as well. In the Advocate he described the process as too slow, repetitive and inefficient. Let me remind the House who introduced these proposals. It was those opposite. The Labor Party introduced this slow, cumbersome system that they are now so vigorous in criticising.","17"
"GT4","Not only did they introduce the system, but when they were in government they said it could not be done any faster or any better. The honourable member for Hotham said in the House of Representatives on 25 November 1992, `One cannot magically shorten the anti-dumping period and expect to have better anti-dumping provisions.' In government they could not do it any faster. We will deliver faster results.","17"
"PG6","Mr Speaker","12","17"
"PG6","My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Does the Minister for Family Services stand by his statement in the House yesterday where he said:","17"
"PG6","'Accommodation charges go to capital upgrading . . . the daily fees go directly to nursing homes.' Is it not a fact that not one extra dollar of the $133 million raised by the extra daily fee will go to increasing nursing home budgets?","17"
"GJ4","I do stand by what I said yesterday. Accommodation charges that are raised go to capital upgrades. Daily fees that are paid by residents go to the care needs of those residents and those funds go to the hands of the providers. That is the factual situation. What you are trying to do","17"
"WI4","I sincerely thank the member for Moreton for his question because today we could not get one from the other side on waterfront. Where is my Kylie Minoguer? The Prime Minister got one and the Treasurer got one. These guys are so politically embarrassed about the waterfront and their own defence of the indefensible that they cannot even muster the political courage to stand up here and ask me just one question about the waterfront. So I do sincerely thank the member for his question. The industrial action that we are about to see in Sydney is the culmination of years of failure by the previous Labor government which has led to the circumstance today where Australia's exporters, Australia's farmers, those people who rely on the $120 billion worth of goods going across the Australian waterfront are unable to obtain an efficient and reliable service on the Australian waterfront. You can trace it all the way back to the time when the Leader of the Opposition was the senior member of the then Labor government. They had a report done on the waterfront. The advice to the government was at page 31, volume 1, of the report by the Interstate Commission entitled Waterfront Investigation Conclusions and Recommendations. It stated: Although there was general agreement that the number of waterfront unions should be reduced, more concern was expressed in the second round about possible abuses of power by a single maritime union. In other words, they were told nearly 10 years ago, back in 1989, that if we are to have an efficient waterfront and if we are to do away with the rorts, inefficiencies and the industrial action 10 times the national average then we would have to have a more competitive system on the Australian waterfront. If we were to do something about Australia's foreign debt these guys would have needed to have the courage to stand up to the thuggery of the MUA and require a far more efficient waterfront. They failed to do so for years and today they do not even have the guts to stand up and ask a simple question about the state of the waterfront. It is no wonder, given those inefficiency. For example, the rort of the day is that of the three man lashing team. It is a variation on the Three Musketeers motto `All for one and one for all.' Except in the wharfies case for the lashing team it is `One sick, all sick at full pay.' One sick and they all go out. This is what you think is admirable about the Australian waterfront. This is why you are embarrassed to ask questions. You do not even have what it takes in your own tactics committee to say, `Listen guys, it's about time we finally had a position which is somehow distant from the MUA.' You are bound hand and foot. You must be the weakest Leader of the Labor Party we have seen in 30 years. It is absolutely pathetic. The Labor Party are the architects of the circumstance on the Australian waterfront. Not only was WIRA a failure, but its failure is evident on the waterfront today. I will give you two examples. The first is the rorts and rip-offs that we have seen for years. The second is that after they forked out $420 million to wharfies to become redundant, we now find that in the Patricks organisation alone there are 290 wharfies, who are classified as casual, who were actually paid out in the WIRA process. They were paid out $80,000 to $90,000 plus superannuation. Those in the Patricks organisation were paid out $25 million to $29 million to get rid of them and they are still there, in this particular case, earning $30,000 to $40,000 a year as casuals. This is the legacy of Labor's ties to the trade union movement. You are still bound hand and foot to them and it is testimony to your chronic weakness.","17"

"10000","I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The ongoing concern amongst older Australians created by the government's policies, particularly in the area of aged care. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places Before I call the honourable member for Jagajaga, I draw her attention and that of the other members who will participate in the debate to the fact that there is a related item on the business paper for today. While members participating can obviously refer to that legislation, I would suggest they should not refer in detail to the questions or clauses, otherwise they will be anticipating the debate.","17"
"PG6","From 1 March this year, all older Australians needing nursing home care have faced an extra daily fee imposed on nursing home and hostel residents by the Howard government. What the public understand, particularly those who need to go into nursing homes but this Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) has shown again in question time today that he does not understands that the nursing homes receive not one cent of benefit from that fee. It is all clawed back by this government. So the $133 million that is raised from the pockets of nursing home and hostel residents in this country will be collected by nursing home owners. They are effectively being turned into tax collectors by this government. All of the money, $133 million from nursing home residents, will be clawed back by this government. It is a tax by anything but name. However, under repeated questioning yesterday and we tried again today to get the minister to face the facts the minister says, 'No, the money raised by the daily fees goes to nursing homes.' The nursing homes certainly collect it. 'It does not go to the government; it goes to upgrading nursing homes.' So we asked the question: how much extra will go to the budgets of nursing homes? The minister comes in here again today and says, 'No, it is going to nursing homes.' Minister, unfortunately nobody out there in nursing homes believes you. I am sure you have seen a comment from the Catholics, the Anglicans, the Baptists and the Uniting Church which they put out on 27 February this year. They made it very clear to you if you did not understand it before then, you are certainly not demonstrating that you understand it here in the parliament that the extra daily fees do not contribute any extra money to the upkeep of the homes. So, as the minister said yesterday, it does not go to the upgrading of nursing homes. They said that no extra money goes to the upkeep of the homes; no extra money goes to the care of residents; and no extra money goes to the future development of services. What it means is that no extra money goes to the nursing homes. Sooner or later, the minister will have to come into this House and correct the answers that he has given in question time yesterday and today. The minister has been told this for some time. It is not as if it is a new matter that has only just been brought to his attention. In press releases last year, in November and again in December, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association made it very clear: New income tested charges to apply from 1 March 1998 still do not add an extra dollar to care nor to capital funding. Not one extra dollar goes to care or capital funding. So sooner or later, Minister, you are going to have to come clean to the Australian public, particularly to nursing home residents, that not one extra dollar of this extra daily fee is going to go to improve the lot of people in nursing homes. It was made clear to you again in December: The Australian Catholic Health Care Association again calls on the Government to use the income testing charges, being introduced from 1 March 1998 . . . to finance both care and capital . . . The government has taken no notice whatsoever of the calls by all the churches for the government to put the money from this income tested fee into improving the care of people in nursing homes. Of course, elderly people in Australia are becoming used to the way in which this government goes about treating them. Let us go back over the absolute debacle that we saw with the introduction of accommodation bonds. It is exactly the same. The minister at the time refused to acknowledge, just like this minister is refusing to acknowledge, that the income tested fee has nothing to do with improving the care of residents in nursing homes. So it was through the whole of last year that we had this whole government","17"
"PG6","Terry Sweetman continues: . . . they've raised their families, they've lost their loved ones, and now they're old and still they haven't paid enough. That is what this government is saying. That is it in a nutshell: 'You haven't paid enough. It doesn't matter that you are sick and old and need to go into a nursing home. It doesn't matter that the only asset you have, your home, will have to be used to pay the annual fees.' The icing on the cake is this extra tax that started on 1 March this year that will see the government raise $133 million, not one cent of which will go to improve the lot of people in nursing homes. There will not be one extra nurse employed. The food will not improve. The buildings will not improve. Nothing will improve as a result of this extra tax. It all goes to the government's bottom line. It is time the government abolished this fee and gave people who need nursing home care the care they deserve.","17"
"LN6","Can we remember? Is it now the minister for Pru Goward, possibly? I am not sure. The article in the Australian has the heading `Confusion prevails in aged-care system.' That was on 31 August 1996. Has anything changed? The answer is no. Under this new minister, who was brought in to take over the shambles that was created by the previous minister at the behest of the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) the shambles that was created in public policy in relation to nursing homes has quietened down over the last few months. But, Minister, let me tell you, when you reintroduce that bill into the House tonight, a bill which has already passed through this House, the quiet that you have heard in relation to this matter for some months will be blown away on the wind. This issue is vital and important to the older people of Australia. They know that the Labor Party way of providing for aged care over the period from 1983 until 1996 was utterly different from the mean-spirited and nasty approach of the member for Bennelong and his sideshow alley of a government. They know that it was possible to have a system with three principal elements in aged care. People could remain at home and have home and community care provided to them. They were better off in their own homes. They knew that if they became frail to a point where they could no longer be taken care of in their own home, under Labor they had a real choice. They had a choice to go into hostels; not into a contracted, almost minuscule and non-existent program that was there prior to the Labor period, but into a hostel program that grew in terms of real funding by 15 per cent a year, year on year, throughout Labor's period of office. When the Minister for Family Services waved that graph before us indicating a downturn in funding for nursing homes over the period of Labor government, he forgot deliberately of course to mention that there is a massive corollary to that. The corollary is a 15 per cent a year, year on year, increase in real funding to people in hostels to give them a real choice and a massive increase in funding for home and community care, so that the vast majority of those people who would not go into nursing homes—96 per cent of the aged population of Australia—had better choices open to them. We now have a government which, from March 1996 on, has been hell-bent on belting the daylights out of the aged community in Australia. We know what they intended to do even before they started their legislative process, because their minions, those under their direct orders, those who put together their great yellow book of instruction the National Commission of Audit, had some suggestions for the government. It said that the government should urgently implement measures to reduce the potential for longer term aged related funding increases. Haven't they taken that to heart! The second part of it was that, failing that, they should make allowances now in budget figuring to provide them. I can report to the House that they have not done the second, but they have certainly done the first. They will reduce the potential for longer term aged funding because they are going to make the people who use those services, people in dire need, people in a position where they are forced to go into a nursing home because of ill-health, suffer. The second point they made was that the government should take action now to change expectations of reliance on government assistance.","17"
"3V5","All they can do is say, 'Who did you copy that off? Where did you get that information? It wasn't us. We had 13 years. We were going to address it in our 14th year. That is when we were going to do something about nursing homes. We handled the hostels but nursing homes were too hard.' The Labor Party have nothing. They have scare campaigns and all they want to do is increase taxes. Alannah MacTiernan from the Labor Party in Western Australia recommended at your national conference the reintroduction of death taxes. That is what you people over there are after increasing death taxes. You do not care about older Australians, generational responsibilities or mutual obligations. You do not care about any of that. You are only into scaring some of the most vulnerable people in our country who have served this country well. All you want to do is create a scare campaign. The Labor Party will do whatever it takes. They want the votes. They will scare as much as they can. They will do whatever it takes.","17"
"N/A","Bill presented by Mr Speaker, and read a first time.","17"
"10000","I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill I have just presented provides, for the first time, for the establishment and administration of a separate Parliamentary Service to support the operations of the houses of the Australian parliament. The staff at present providing the parliament with its support services operate under administrative and staffing structures established by the Public Service Act 1922; however, it has been decided that the parliamentary administration should have its own legislation which recognises and mandates that the primary obligation of Parliamentary Service staff is to serve the parliament as a whole. The bill is identical to the bill that was passed by the House on 30 October 1997. It had been introduced into the House on 23 October 1997 and was amended following the report of the then Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Public Service Bill 1997. The Senate returned the Public Service legislation and the Parliamentary Service Bill with amendments to which the House disagreed, and the three bills were laid aside on 5 December 1997. As the government has decided that the Public Service legislation, which establishes a complementary framework, should be reintroduced, it is desirable that the bills be considered together. Otherwise, the Parliamentary Service could become isolated, and left remaining under existing legislation which is recognised by all sides of the parliament to be outdated. The Parliamentary Service Bill follows as much as possible the philosophy, content and structure of the Public Service Bill 1997, which changes significantly the structure of public service employment, with certain modifications necessary to ensure the independence of the parliament from executive government. It establishes an employment framework which mirrors that proposed for the Australian Public Service generally and provides specifically for the reciprocal mobility of staff between the two services without loss of accrued entitlements. The ability of staff to move freely and unfettered is essential to the health and strength of both services. There are significant differences between the parliamentary and public service bills which recognise that staff in parliamentary departments serve the houses of the parliament. That distinction is reflected in the first object of the bill, which is to establish an apolitical Parliamentary Service that is efficient and effective in serving the Parliament. The Parliamentary Service Bill contains a statement of Parliamentary Service values and a code of conduct, provides for the appointment of a Parliamentary Service Commissioner, makes specific reference to the offices of Clerk of the Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives, and provides for appointments to those offices. Tenure as Clerk of either House will be for one 10-year period. The bill also stipulates conditions for earlier termination of those appointments. Occupants of the office may retire earlier once they attain the age of 55 years. Secretaries, other than Clerks, are to be appointed by the Speaker and the President for five-year terms with termination arrangements similar to those applying to secretaries of executive departments. There are transitional arrangements to ensure the continuation in office of current heads of parliamentary departments. In broad terms, the Presiding Officers will have the same employment powers as ministers under the Public Service Bill with advice from the Parliamentary Service Commissioner. Consistent with the need to preserve the independence of the Clerks as impartial advisers, the Clerks of the House of Representatives and of the Senate are not to be subject to direction from the Presiding Officers in relation to the nature of their advice provided with respect to either house, to members or to committees. Secretaries to parliamentary departments, including the Clerks, cannot be directed in relation to the exercise of their powers in respect of specific individuals. The Presiding Officers will have the power to give secretaries to parliamentary departments, including the Clerks, general directions relating to the management and leadership of the Parliamentary Service. The bill also creates the new office of Parliamentary Service Commissioner with a role similar to that of the Public Service Commissioner. The Parliamentary Service Commissioner will have the task of advising the Presiding Officers with respect to the management practices and policies of the Parliamentary Service and, if requested by the relevant Presiding Officer, of investigating and reporting on specific issues. While the bill provides specifically that the Parliamentary Service Commissioner is to be appointed separately and independently by the Presiding Officers, it is expected that normally the same person would fill the office of both the Parliamentary Service Commissioner and the Public Service Commissioner. This would assist in ensuring overall comparability and consistency between the two services. However, the bill specifically provides that the commissioner cannot be subject to direction by executive government in relation to the Parliamentary Service. Secretaries to parliamentary departments, including the two Clerks, are to have the same employment powers as those proposed for departmental secretaries in the Australian Public Service. As mentioned earlier, the bill incorporates a legally enforceable code of conduct and a statement of Parliamentary Service values. These values reflect the fact that staff serve the houses but, in other respects, mirror those of the Public Service Bill, with a parallel reference to the requirement that employment decisions in the Parliamentary Service be based on merit. In summary, this bill gives legislative effect to the decision that the parliamentary administration should not continue to be covered by the standard Australian Public Service Act. It establishes a statutory framework and administrative arrangements broadly consistent with those for the Public Service, while incorporating the changes necessary to accommodate the unique circumstances of serving the houses. It provides the houses with a set of arrangements which will allow them to continue to attract and provide a career for those staff who will be equipped to deliver the high level of service the houses currently enjoy. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned.","17"

"BV5","The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 relates to the statutory marketing authorities, research development corporations as well as the Fisheries Management Authority. Within the latter, the budget last year removed $3.612 million of the Commonwealth's contribution to the research and development funding component of the FRDC at a time when the fishing industry could least afford to lose that amount of money. We were told that the justification for this was that the FRDC had displayed prudent financial management and that the funds were to be used to offset expenditures elsewhere in fisheries related matters. The original proposal was for the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) to direct the FRDC board to hand back the funds from reserves. It was not until well after the budget that this option was found to be unacceptable. Instead, specific legislation was needed to effect a one-off cut to the FRDC's annual allocation. This is the bill that reached parliament and the government has buried a clause in this amendment bill to effect a cut in the annual allocation. This is unacceptable. As the Deputy Chair of the House Standing Committee on Primary Industry, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs that reported to the parliament in June 1997 in its report entitled Managing Commonwealth fisheries , I am very concerned that this goes completely against the recommendations that we brought down in that report. That was a bipartisan report and it had the full support of government and opposition members, who supported the recommendations. The government has turned turtle and is taking funding away. It is a nonsense action, particularly when the fisheries report spoke of the dwindling supplies of fish and the desperate need for information on fish stocks. The Age on 18 December last year picked this up saying it was a grim outlook for the fishing industry. It stated: The commercial sustainability of some of Australia's most valuable and popular fish southern blue fin tuna, school shark and gem fish is uncertain as overfishing continues to take its toll on stocks. Not only did our report flag this problem but a Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics fisheries status report in December last year also warned that the numbers of school shark and gem fish are failing to recover from overfishing. Australia's research has shown that the bluefin tuna stocks are dangerously low, yet the Japanese are pushing for more fish and Australia knows that the continuing spawning stock are well below the safe biological limits. We still do not have the full picture. We need to know more about the fishery's capabilities. The report stated: One of the greatest obstacles in effective fisheries management will always be the problems associated with poor knowledge about the marine environment because of the high costs of undertaking all the research that is necessary for the management of fish stocks. We have to set priorities and we have to find ways of ensuring that they are funded. In the recommendations, the committee was clear in saying that, in order to develop a long-term research strategy, it is essential that the funding level be more stable and secure. The committee's recommendation No. 34 stipulates quite clearly that the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation receives its funding on the same basis as other industry and research and development corporations to give greater certainty of funding levels on a year-to-year basis. So the report brought down the recommendations that we should be doing more, we should stabilise research in this area, we should do more research, we should be looking after it, moving it along and making it more stable, but, of course, the government is not doing that.","17"

"0K6","The debate on Sydney's airport needs continues to arouse a lot of heat. Last December the EIS on Badgerys Creek was released, and then in January the auditor's report was produced by SMEC. Needless to say, those two reports have generated a considerable reaction within the local community, and I am sure the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) would agree with that. The pent-up anxiety of local residents was released in a flood after the release of those documents. Some of that was really rather exaggerated, but a lot of those concerns were very well founded and quite justified. The EIS and the parallel audit show two things very clearly. They show, firstly, that this government has delivered on its promise to conduct a fully transparent EIS, and that is in stark contrast to the policies of the Labor Party. Before the last election, the then Labor government was not even going to offer an EIS until the coalition promised it would do an EIS and then, kicking and screaming, Labor promised that they would finally come on board and conduct an EIS as well. The parallel audit process on this EIS was the first time in Australia that any government has commissioned an independent parallel audit on an EIS process. It is the first time that that process has been published, that the audit report has been published and opened to further community scrutiny and consultation, and it is the first time that a government has committed itself to taking on board the recommendations of that audit and to then adjust the EIS process according to findings of that audit process an independent, transparent and thorough EIS. The second thing that the EIS and audit process showed is this: it does raise considerable doubts about Badgerys Creek airport. The EIS itself shows that there are problems with aircraft noise, that there are problems with air quality, and there are problems with transport links. Particularly significant were the problems with air quality in western Sydney. The EIS shows that western Sydney is already at maximum levels of ozone and that the construction of an airport there would probably lead to a 25 to 30 per cent increase in ozone levels in western Sydney. Furthermore, the audit process conducted by SMEC shows that there were significant shortcomings in the EIS process and that there was insufficient attention given to the impact on surface drainage system, particularly the Hawkesbury-Nepean system. It showed that waste disposal issues were not adequately covered, that there was a lack of rigour in the economic analysis, and that there was inadequate analysis of the social impact. The pleasing thing is that the minister has committed himself to taking on board those concerns raised by the independent audit. They will be looked at and the EIS process will continue to look at those issues. This again is a sharp contrast to Labor's position. You remember that before the last election the then minister, now the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), said that the Badgerys Creek airport would go ahead regardless of the EIS in other words, we will do an EIS, sure; then we will ignore it and push ahead regardless of what it says, regardless of what the residents want. At least this government has said that we will address the issues raised in the EIS, we will address the issues raised in the audit report and we will then consider it further. The Hobart conference of the Labor Party certainly gave no assurance to the people of western Sydney. In fact, it was a con job pure and simple. It was a two bob each way bet. The Labor Party said, `Sure, we are still committed to having a second airport in the Sydney Basin, but we will not quite say it will be at Badgerys Creek. It will be somewhere else in the Sydney Basin.' It is obvious that the Labor Party was trying to treat the people of western Sydney as fools. If it is not going to be at Badgerys Creek but they still want it in the Sydney Basin, where in the world do they think they are going to put it? That whole process was a cynical exercise by the Labor Party to try to con the people of western Sydney again. The EIS on the Badgerys Creek proposal and the audit report have made it very clear that there are doubts about the Badgerys Creek site. Those doubts are significant enough to have to think again. Those doubts are significant enough to say that Badgerys Creek is not the location for another airport, and to say that we need to look for an alternative. It is simply not fair to the residents of western Sydney to transfer the problems of inner city to the people of the west. It is time to think again.","17"

"CT4","The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Japanese economy slowed considerably in 1997 as a result of very weak domestic demand. Poor consumer and business sentiment and the turmoil in Asia are adversely affecting the economic outlook. The Japanese government has attempted to address the weakness in domestic demand with several initiatives, such as personal tax cuts and a reduction in some corporate and land taxes, together with increased government assistance to aid the troubled financial sector. The outlook for Japan in 1998 in expected to remain weak as a result of slower export growth into the Asian region. (2) The United States economy grew by 3.8 per cent in year average terms in 1997, well above the long-term trend rate of growth. Growth is expected to slow relative to these recent very rapid rates of growth, but the outlook in the United States remains very positive and will help support the international economic environment.
