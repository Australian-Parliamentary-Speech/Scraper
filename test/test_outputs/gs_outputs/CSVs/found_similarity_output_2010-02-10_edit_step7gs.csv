"00AMR","That is merely a snapshot of those members opposite who have previously spoken in support of an emissions trading scheme. What has happened to all of those voices supporting an emissions trading scheme? We still have one, and that is the member for Wentworth who sought to show leadership on the issue of climate change and he lost his job because of it. The members opposite have no credibility when it comes to climate change because fundamentally a large proportion of them just do not believe it is happening. They have changed policies and changed leaders or, in some cases, they have changed leaders in order to change policy. It has been pretty confusing to get a picture of where they sit on this issue. The end result has been a party who now stands for nothing and a leader who believes climate change ‘is absolute crap’ and who is delivering to the Australian people a climate change con job. Members of the Rudd government do not doubt that climate change is real. The climate science is there and, because we know that the science exists, we know that we have to act. Scientists across the globe are telling us that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change—that we are contributing to climate change. We recognised this a long time ago. We understood that Australia would feel the impacts of climate change more severely than many other countries. The risk to this country is great. More importantly, we also understood that the longer we take to act the greater the potential harm. That is why members of this government have a clear way forward. In contrast to the Liberal Party, we have a clear position on climate change and, more importantly, we have a united position on tackling its most dangerous effects. Our scheme is a simple one. We make polluters pay, we provide incentives for investment in cleaner technology and we compensate the majority of families for increased costs. Our scheme is the lowest cost way of reducing emissions. Our scheme will see 92 per cent of households compensated for the impact of the scheme. We have been upfront about it with the Australian people, with Treasury modelling showing that there will be about a one per cent increase in household costs overall. Our scheme is widely recognised as the best approach to reduce carbon pollution, an approach that John Howard, Malcolm Turnbull and Joe Hockey have all previously supported and that some of them continue to support. We have outlined an approach that is accepted by governments across the world, one that is supported by scientists and that recognises the reality of climate change. Many members opposite argue that with this bill we are acting all on our own, but they fail to recognise that an emissions trading scheme is widely recognised by all major economies as the best way to tackle and reduce carbon emissions. Our carbon emissions trading scheme is the strongest way to meet our carbon emissions reduction target and keeps our 2007 election commitment that we would tackle climate change, a commitment that was overwhelmingly supported by the Australian people in that election. Let me briefly outline some of the details of this bill. The government is proposing to establish a carbon pollution reduction target. We are making a commitment to reduce our carbon emissions by five per cent by 2020, and that commitment is unconditional. We have also committed to reduce carbon emissions by up to 15 per cent or 25 per cent conditional on the actions of others. I have made no secret in this parliament that I am in favour of having a higher carbon emissions reduction target. Let me remind the House that these are targets the Liberal Party supported last year. Therefore, if we are to assume that these targets have bipartisan support then we should assume that both parties have a plan to achieve these targets, although with the announcement of the Abbott plan we see that the coalition are no longer serious about climate change as under their plan these targets will not be achieved. In fact, under the scheme proposed by the opposition, we have already heard reported in the media that emissions will rise by 13 per cent. They will not go down by the five per cent that they claim is their target, the same target as ours, but in fact will go up. Our plan, the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, will enable the federal government to set a target to reduce our carbon print. Our scheme will provide a mechanism whereby companies that emit carbon pollution will need to buy a permit to produce that pollution. We put a price on carbon and we create an incentive for those producers to therefore reduce their costs. We also provide an incentive for polluters to invest in renewable energies. This is what the government is all about—we are setting our nation up for the longer term and to do this we must provide industry with the means to achieve it. Furthermore, the revenue received from the sale of these permits will be given back to businesses and households to assist them with the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. As I said earlier, under our scheme households will be compensated for the impact of the emissions trading scheme. Under the Liberal Party’s plan costs will go up. They have to pay for it somehow. The only way they can pay for it is by either increasing taxes or cutting services to hospitals, education, defence, infrastructure and roads. They have to pay for it from somewhere, but they have not made their plans transparent about that. People’s costs will go up, but there is no compensation in their scheme. The Liberal Party have a long history of ducking the issue of climate change. We started with the Howard policy No. 1: ‘Climate change doesn’t exist or, if it does, I really don’t want to talk about it.’ Howard policy No. 2 was: ‘Climate change does exist—maybe I’d better cobble something together before the 2007 election because I could lose it.’ The Nelson policy on climate change was—well, frankly, what policy? We had the Turnbull policy, which was to support an ETS with the backing of half his colleagues. Unfortunately, he lost his job as a result. And now we have the Abbott policy—slap something together to try and score a few votes with no real thought about what they are actually going to be doing in relation to climate change itself. There are some real problems with the opposition’s policy. Firstly, if you think climate change is ‘crap’—and again I quote, because it is not language I use myself—maybe you are not the best person to be developing your party’s climate change policy, frankly. I find this passing strange when eminent scientists across the globe are overwhelmingly telling us that climate change is real. They may have some disagreements about its impacts—it is a pretty imprecise science to project exactly what is going to happen—but they are all pretty adamant that climate change is real. The new Leader of the Opposition, in a road to Damascus moment when he was out touting his book at a Liberal Party fundraiser with a less than representative sample of a very small community—a fantastic community in the town of Beaufort—suddenly declared as a result of this meeting with Liberal Party members in Beaufort, ‘Climate change is crap but the politics are against us, so I’m going to support it.’ A bit later on he thought: ‘I might be on a bit of a winner here. I actually think we might entirely change our whole position in relation to supporting the government, because I think the politics are shifting.’ This is great leadership—really impressive leadership. Instead of maybe talking to the community members at Beaufort about why climate change is real and why it is important to act, understanding that they have some concerns about it but convincing them of what the evidence says, let’s forget all about the evidence. Let’s take this small, unrepresentative sample of Liberal Party members sitting out there in the great town of Beaufort and let them convince the Leader of the Opposition that climate change is crap, the politics have changed and they should absolutely overturn not only the ETS policy but their leader as a result. The coalition’s policy is fundamentally flawed because it does not tackle climate change, it costs taxpayers more and it is totally unfunded, which means that members opposite are going to either increase taxes or cut services. Members opposite should be clear with people in my electorate whether they plan to increase taxes or whether they instead plan to cut vital government funding in areas such as health, schools or even infrastructure. My concern is that members opposite are going to slug taxpayers in my own electorate or they are going to cut vital services. The Liberal con job is three times more expensive than the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and will do nothing to reduce emissions. The Department of Climate Change has found that the Liberals’ policy will increase emissions, not reduce them. Bloomberg New Energy Finance yesterday said that the price of carbon under the opposition’s scheme will result in a massive impost on business. The opposition are trying to tell the Australian people: ‘You won’t have to pay anything under our scheme. There’ll be no cost.’ If the price for carbon under the opposition’s scheme is going to be a massive impost on business, you are going to pay for it, and there is no compensation under the opposition’s scheme. The Abbott climate con job fails to put a cap on pollution because it gives polluters an absolutely free ride. Our plan sets a price for the pollution that is produced by industry, therefore creating an incentive for business to, firstly, reduce emissions and, secondly, invest in renewable energies. The fact that the coalition have failed to address this fundamental element is mind-boggling and will subsequently result in the failure of their policy. The next major concern that exists in the coalition’s proposal is in the maths. What you can see from the coalition’s plan is that it is not funded. They are trying to say: ‘Don’t worry about this plan. It’s not going to cost you anything at all. It’s going to reduce emissions. It’s this magical cure that we’ve got for climate change. It’s really simple. It’s not going to cost you anything.’ Again, you have to pay for it by either raising taxes or cutting services, and you should be honest with people about what you are planning to do. It is only fair for people across the community to be aware of what it is we are debating and what they will be paying for. I want to finish on a few of the reasons that I personally am supporting these bills. As a federal member of parliament, I recognise the importance of decisions that I make in this place on behalf of the community that I represent. Not all of the community agrees with the decisions I make—I know that—but I have to make those decisions on the basis of the evidence I have before me. That is what leadership is about. I recognise the importance of this decision and the effect it will have on future generations—our children, our grandchildren and their children. That is fundamentally what this debate is about. My decision to support these bills is vital for our children, our grandchildren and their children. It goes to the heart of what we represent as political leaders. These bills seek to structurally change our economy to support jobs for our nation for the longer term. The legislation does not represent a bleak future, as members opposite would lead us to believe. Our plan will provide an opportunity for new jobs, new possibilities and a cleaner future. It will put Australia ahead of the race to tackle climate change. The legislation will ensure our nation steps up to tackle climate change, it will set our local economies up for the long term and it will give Australian families a competitive advantage compared to our international counterparts. The answer to this debate is pretty simple: the Rudd government plan that addresses climate change at a minimal cost to households or a backwards coalition con job that slugs taxpayers and will in fact increase emissions? Our plan will reduce our nation’s carbon footprint. The Liberals’ plan will see taxpayers cough up $10 billion for a climate change policy that has been developed by a leader who thinks climate change is ‘absolute crap’. The Rudd government’s plan will make polluters pay for their emissions, and the Abbott con job plan will give polluters a free ride and slug households instead. Our plan delivers assistance to families with money raised from polluters, and assistance to pensioners and low- and middle-income households. I would like to finish by quoting the member for Wentworth. When he put the question, ‘Is the CPRS the best policy?’ he said the answer absolutely ‘must be yes’. I urge the members opposite to listen to their colleague, to show the leadership that their colleague has shown and to support these bills.","17"

"10000","The point of order is understood. Whilst the reference was couched in terms of the broad, it did follow immediately on the reference to the member for Ryan and I think it would assist the House if the member for Newcastle withdrew.","12"
"HWN","I am a little flabbergasted at the previous speech from the member for Newcastle. I hope she does not injure herself as she falls off that fence that she has been straddling for the last 20 minutes. I fear that poor old Grandad, who fought so hard for miners rights at Rothbury years ago, is turning over in his grave at the selling out of the coal miners of the Hunter Valley. Indeed, over the last 12 months I have had hundreds of emails from coal miners terribly concerned about the future of their jobs and the industry which they are so passionate about. I have spoken twice previously in this House on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and for the sake of my constituents I am speaking on it again. I heard the speech from the member for Oxley about an hour ago, and he said that he has been watching people in this debate speak about things that they do not believe in and have no commitment to. I can tell you that I have a commitment to this issue. I believe this is probably the single biggest issue that we as a country need to deal with in our generation. If we do not get this right, our country in the near future, as well as in future generations, will be paying for this for years to come. Since this legislation was first introduced, the Prime Minister has been getting some criticism that he has not being doing a very good job of explaining it. I do not think the Prime Minister does anything without carefully thinking it through. Being foolhardy and careless is not one of the Prime Minister’s weaknesses. The reason he has not done a very good job of explaining it is that the more he explains it the more devastating the effects on Australia become. We have heard some fantastic presentations in this House, particularly from the members on the government side, about the effects of global warming, the reality of global warming, rising sea levels. I remember the member for Isaacs had half his electorate underwater at one stage. You will get no argument from me: climate change is a real issue. Whether it is going to be as dramatic as the member for Isaacs and the contribution from before Christmas from the member for Makin, just to name a couple, have claimed, remains to be seen; but we would be foolhardy to ignore that climate change is something that we need to address. No-one from the government side has made that link, has stood up here and said, ‘You need to support the CPRS because this is how it is going to reduce the temperature of the globe.’ Not one person on that side has said, ‘This is why you need to support this bill.’ They have been very emotive about climate change, and they have been very derisive, claiming that those of us who want to dare challenge the great world leader in environment change, our Prime Minister, are deniers, dinosaurs and worse. Not one of them has defended their legislation. If they could explain to me how this legislation is going to reduce the temperature of the globe; how it is going to make it rain in the upper catchments of the Murray-Darling, so that we can return agriculture to full production; how it is not going to put the suburbs of Port Phillip under water, I would vote for it—I would support it. But they have not done that. The other thing that is quite fascinating is that last year we had this build-up to the world conference in Copenhagen, and the Prime Minister got himself appointed as a Friend of the Chair—sort of like the hall monitor of Copenhagen. He might have got a little badge that said ‘prefect’ and got to buzz around. He changed his timetable so that he could be there with the President of the United States and could be in all the shots as our world leader in fixing the climate. Of course, Copenhagen was somewhat of a disappointment, I suspect, to the Prime Minister. From my own point of view, what happened at Copenhagen was not surprising. But it is like Copenhagen never happened. I was in this House at 10.30 last Tuesday, the 2nd—I remember it very clearly—and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change, Mr Combet, was introducing this bill into the House for the third time. And guess what that day was? It is not a big deal in Australia, but many of you will have seen that great movie Groundhog Day . Last Tuesday, 2 February was Groundhog Day . I had to pinch myself that I was not sitting on the set of some bizarre movie as the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change reintroduced this bill. It was like the world had not moved on. It was like the United States had not rejected a cap-and-trade scheme and had started speaking about direct action. The member for Newcastle’s speech was a classic example of, ‘If we say something earnestly enough, and we say it often enough, it must be true.’ On the fact that this legislation would have a devastating effect on the members in her electorate—the members of the steel industry, the coal industry, the port industry—she just said that was not the case; therefore, it must not be the case! The member for Paterson was right to highlight the hypocrisy of her, and the government she is a part of, when they trumpeted in the Newcastle Herald photos of Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Rudd in their hardhats, opening new rail links and commissioning port facilities for the export of coal, an industry that this CPRS intends to tax to the hilt. How is the coal industry going to innovate? How are the electricity industry generators in the Hunter Valley, and the people the member for Newcastle represents who work in those generators, going to adapt to a lower carbon future if the top of their profits is taken off, is taxed? We have heard a lot from the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change about how this tax is going to be redistributed to pensioners and low-income earners—and that, as a matter of fact, some people are going to be better off under this scheme, so it must be good: ‘We are going to save the environment and people are going to have more money in their pockets; it is just those evil polluters that will pay.’ Well, guess who the ‘evil polluters’ are? The evil polluters are those people who, when they wake up in the morning, turn on their lights to see what the time is. When they turn the tap on and the system comes into play and they have a hot shower—they are the evil polluters. When they get on the electric train and travel into the city to work, and use electricity, they are the evil polluters. The irony of that is that, if you get into your V8 Commodore and travel from Campbelltown to the city, Mr Rudd is going to compensate you. I think he is going to give you a cent more for your fuel, if you go in your car, but if you go on the electric train, that is taxed under the CPRS. So you will pay more to go on the electric train from Campbelltown to Sydney than you would if you drive your V8 Commodore! Where is the sense in that? There was talk about compensating our pensioners, our elderly. In an aged-care facility in a medium-sized town in my electorate already the increase in electricity prices means that every bill they get has gone up by $3,000. The CPRS will probably put their electricity up by another $4,000 a month. Where is the compensation for that? Are they going to say, ‘I’m terribly sorry, Mrs Jones, your contribution to this country for the last 101 years has been magnificent but, because of the government’s CPRS, we’re going to restrict the use of your air conditioner between two and four o’clock in the afternoon’? In Coonabarabran, which is the place I am speaking about, in summertime it gets very hot. ‘But, Mrs Jones, I don’t care that you’re 101 and you’ve paid taxes all your life. You’re an evil polluter. You’re using electricity.’ Where, oh where, is the sense in that? But it is worse than that. There is no environmental impact, because the idea of the CPRS is to make people use less electricity. When you do not have an alternative, you either turn it off or you pay more. If you cannot afford to pay more, you have to turn it off. The other thing is that a lot of jobs will be exported overseas. There is no greater example in my electorate than in the town of Kandos. In the redistribution of electoral boundaries, it is going to be in the seat of Hunter, and I wonder if the member for Hunter has as much care about the people of Kandos as I do as their present member. The town of Kandos has a cement plant. It employs between 110 and 120 people and it has been there since 1880-something. There are people in that plant who have worked there all their lives and they are the sixth or seventh generation to work in that plant. Under the CPRS, Mr Rudd has said, ‘We will give you a permit for 90 per cent of your emissions—but not all of your emissions, just the emissions in the baking process.’ To make cement, you mine the limestone and the shale, then you mix it all up and crush it up and you bake it using a coal-fired power station and you end up with something called clinker. The final stage of the process is that you grind the clinker up, and that gives you your cement. Mr Rudd said to the people of Kandos cement plant: ‘We’ll give you 90 per cent for the baking process.’ That equates to 30 per cent of the total emissions cost at that plant. At the moment, the cost of producing cement in Kandos and the cost of importing it from China or Indonesia are about lineball. There is an advantage for the owners of this company because it is located in the central west of New South Wales and has handy access to the large construction areas in Western Sydney and access to western New South Wales. But with a 30 per cent increase in tax, when the competitors from China and Indonesia do not have that, guess what is going to happen. That plant is going to close and they will be importing either cement or clinker from China or Indonesia into Port Botany. That is the reality of it. That town of Kandos has one major employer. There are 1,400 people and one major employer. The town has an excellent high school and a wonderful primary school, and a lot of the other jobs—contractors, truck drivers and whatever—spin off from that plant. If it closes down, a lot of the small businesses—the supermarket, the local butcher, the newsagent, the garage—will be unviable. So the town of Kandos is in real trouble. When the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change stands up here and says that low-income earners are going to be better off under this scheme, can he explain how a cement worker who is currently on about $60,000 or $70,000 a year and is going to go on unemployment benefits is better off? Has he managed to explain that? It is not just my cement plant in Kandos. Professor Garnaut himself said, in the early work done for this government in the lead-up to this policy, that 126,000 jobs will be removed from regional Australia. If anyone wonders why we as the National Party came out early on in opposition to this scheme, it is because we were the sacrificial lambs. Regional Australia was going to pay for this scheme. The people in the leafy suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne may get a pang of conscience, trade the Volvo in and buy a Prius. Maybe they will tick the green square the next time they go to Fiji for holidays and pay a bit more for their airline ticket, or tick the box on their power bill and get some poor fellow in the hills at Crookwell to plant a few trees to ease their conscience when they turn on their hot-water system or their jacuzzi, but they do not see themselves changing their lifestyle. Maybe if they work in the banking sector, the finance sector or a large trading house they think, ‘There’s a bob to be made out of this!’ Who is going to pay? The people of the regional Australia, the farmers. We had a great discussion last year about removing agriculture from this legislation, but they were talking about removing some of the emissions of agriculture and the ability to claim any of the sequestration people can do. But look at the inputs into agriculture: fuel, farm chemicals based on petroleum and fertilisers based on petroleum. So the people of rural Australia, the farmers, the people that feed Australia and 50 million other people around the world, are going to be hit, but their counterparts overseas will not be. Oh, this is a wonderful idea! What I find astounding as I sit here and listen to the members on the other side who represent regional Australia is how they just stand here and sell out their constituencies. As the Prime Minister stands at the dispatch box at question time and talks about the CPRS and saving the world, they nod and smile in unison behind him as they sell out the people that put them here. It is worse: I have not heard the member for Maribyrnong, that great champion of the Australian Workers Union—whose membership goes right across regional Australia, in agriculture, mining and trucking—come in here and defend this scheme. You can look at the record. I would be surprised if he has. Those opposite have sold out the people that put them here. Put the member for Maribyrnong in front of a mine shaft with a TV crew and he goes like a thrashing machine. Put him in here, where he has to defend a scheme that is going to affect the livelihoods of the people who put him here, and he is silent. The sell-out of the people on that side of the House has been absolutely breathtaking. We have a debate coming up about direct action versus the CPRS. Before I came into this place, I was involved in agriculture. I understand the enormous capacity of Australian soils to store carbon. It is not a simple process. Despite the rhetoric from that side, Australian farmers are not simple folk. They do not need saving from themselves. The truth be known, Australian farmers are leading the world in their environmental practices. This is an area close to me. In the late 1980s, my brothers and I were doing experimental work with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in zero-till farming. The carbon level in those soils has grown exponentially over the last 20 or 30 years—not because they were trying to harvest carbon, but because carbon sequestration in the soil goes hand in hand with the ability of a soil to store water. In agriculture in Australia, storing water is what you need to do to grow the crops. We need to draw on that. We need to let these people in rural Australia who have been doing their bit to improve the environment continue to do so. We need to recognise it, encourage them and reward them. This debate has become one of rhetoric versus practicalities. The people of Australia are waking up. They are waking up to the facts. I will tell you how it happened in the couple of minutes that I have left. They did a poll. Eighty per cent of Australians want to do something about the environment. That is true. We all do. So the Labor Party said: ‘Let’s give ’em something. We won’t go too much into the detail; we’ll just give ’em something. We won’t explain too much about what it is, but we’ll tell ’em it’s good for them.’ What they have done is sold out the people of Australia. They have sold them down the drain. They are making them uncompetitive with the rest of the world for the sake of votes. They have been caught out. This piece of legislation, deservedly, is a dead duck and it should be treated as such.","17"
"83A","I rise once more to give more support to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and the related bills, which will put in place the government’s plan to reduce carbon emissions and transition Australia’s economy to a low-carbon future. The Labor Party went to the last election with a promise to reduce Australia’s carbon emissions and to do that by way of an emissions trading scheme. This legislation honours that promise. We made that commitment based on the scientific evidence that the world is warming and that Australia is one of the countries most at risk from continued climate change. We made that commitment based on economic advice that an emissions trading scheme is the lowest cost way to achieve reductions in carbon emissions. The opposition can pretend otherwise, but there is no zero-cost way to achieve the changes in behaviour and the structural changes in our economy and our way of life that are needed to limit the rise in temperatures. The question is: how do we pay for the change that is needed? The government thinks the big polluters should do their bit while households are protected from the extra costs that might flow through to them from the scheme. The opposition, on the other hand, thinks that the big polluters should keep doing whatever they like and the cost of reducing emissions should be picked up by taxpayers. Taxpayers will be paying for an opposition scheme that does not even promise to reduce carbon emissions. They might even be paying for emissions to rise. That is opposition value for money for you. I believe that Senator Joyce must have come up with that one. Our scheme puts a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide allowed to be produced in Australia each year and requires the biggest polluters to buy permits for the amount of carbon dioxide that they each produce. The supply of permits prescribed by the government and the demand for permits from those big polluters creates a market and therefore a price per tonne of carbon. There will therefore be a carbon price built into the economy which will create an incentive to reduce carbon and a penalty for producing carbon. A carbon price will influence investment decisions and drive the transition to a lower carbon intensive economy through greater energy efficiency, renewable energy and other technologies for reducing carbon, such as carbon capture and storage. In our scheme, the revenue collected from polluters buying permits will go back to households and in some cases to industry by way of assistance and adjustment measures. Low- and most middle-income households will receive direct financial assistance out of the revenue from the sale of permits to big polluters. Households will receive money to cover the extra costs of electricity and other goods and services that may be passed on to them as a result of the CPRS. The CPRS is a transparent market mechanism that will provide business with the certainty that they need right now to start making investment decisions that will shape our country for the next 20 to 50 years. On the other hand, the opposition has come up with a grab bag of initiatives that may or may not reduce emissions at a huge cost to the taxpayer, and business does not know what it will mean for them from one year to the next. There will be a lucky dip for well-connected businesses that can get the ear of the minister and get grants for their projects if they are in the right marginal seats. We saw how that worked under the previous Liberal and National government with Regional Partnerships and the Water Initiative. Other businesses will be subject to penalties the opposition cannot even quantify. The opposition is having us on. This is a political fix for the opposition, not a rational piece of policy making in an area of vital importance to Australia’s future. Once upon a time, the opposition did have a credible and rational plan to address climate change. It is this plan that we are debating now. These bills, amended since the last time that they were debated in this House, are to some degree the opposition’s plan. The bills incorporate the sensible and responsible amendments negotiated between the government and the opposition last year—things like the dedicated funding available to meat processors like Teys Brothers and Swift in Rockhampton or Borthwicks at Bakers Creek to support the development and deployment of technologies to reduce emissions from their waste water. There will also be assistance to convert their operations from coal to natural gas or perhaps even to move to co-generation. The amendments also include things like the exclusion of agriculture from any liability under an emissions trading scheme while at the same time allowing farmers to earn credits for the carbon stored on their properties or carbon abated as a result of their farming practices. There is more assistance to the gassiest coalmines and measures to support the expansion of electricity generation from waste coalmine gas, a growing industry in my electorate. These are sensible and responsible amendments. ‘Sensible’ and ‘responsible’ are two words no longer associated with the Liberal Party and the National Party.","17"

"VU5","Firstly, I thank those members who contributed to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 6) Bill 2009 . Schedule 1 of the bill abolishes the exception to capital gains tax events E1 and E2, widely known as the trust cloning exception. This is consistent with the policy principle of taxing capital gains that arise where there is a change in ownership of an asset. This schedule also provides a limited CGT rollover for the transfer of assets between fixed trusts with the same beneficiaries, each of which has the same interests in each trust. This ensures that CGT considerations are not an undue impediment to the restructure of those trusts whilst ensuring that subsequent changes to the manner and extent to which beneficiaries can benefit from the trust are subject to appropriate tax consequences. Schedule 2 amends the tax law to remove significant income tax impediments to mergers between complying superannuation funds by permitting eligible entities to roll over capital losses and revenue losses under the merger and to transfer previously realised capital losses and revenue losses. This preserves the offsetting value of the losses, thereby removing a potential barrier to superannuation fund consolidation. The loss relief will be available for complying superannuation funds that merge with another complying superannuation fund with five or more members. This assists in maintaining a robust and safe superannuation sector. This measure has a limited period of application from 24 December 2008 until 30 June 2011. Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to clarify the operation of the income tax law for life insurance companies that conduct immediate annuity business. Life insurance companies are exempt from tax on income derived in respect of immediate annuity policies that satisfy the annuity conditions. These conditions are designed to prevent the unreasonable deferral of income. The amendments clarify the circumstances in which the annuity conditions apply. This ensures that the annuity conditions in the 1997 tax act are consistent with the former annuity conditions in the 1936 tax act. Immediate annuity policies offered by life insurance companies often provide for superannuation income streams. The amendments ensure that the annuity conditions do not apply to superannuation income streams so that life insurance companies are taxed on this business in the same way as all other superannuation income stream providers. Schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to make certain organisations deductible gift recipients. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifs to organisations that are deductible gift recipients. This schedule makes the Green Institute and United States Studies Centre deductible gift recipients. It also changes the name of one organisation currently listed in the act from Dymocks Literacy Foundation Ltd to Dymocks Children’s Charities Ltd. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them to attract public support for their activities. Schedule 5 makes the income recovery subsidy payments for the north-western Queensland floods of January and February 2009 income tax exempt. These payments were designed to provide immediate financial assistance to persons affected by the flooding in north-western Queensland in January and February of this year. They were made available to Australian resident employees, small business persons and farmers over 16 years of age who experienced a loss of income as a direct result of the north-western Queensland floods in January and February 2009. Recipients must also have derived an income from, or resided in, the affected area within the designated time period. Schedule 6 makes it clear that when imported high-strength spirits are blended with domestically produced high-strength spirits the blends will remain free of duty under the concessional spirit scheme. This ensures the status quo is maintained. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.","17"

"VU5","Firstly, I would like to thank those members who contributed to this debate on the second reading of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009 . The government is committed to supporting trade and investment whilst combating tax evasion through its network of international tax agreements. This bill will give the force of law to three agreements that will support those objectives: the new tax treaty with New Zealand; the second protocol to the Belgian tax treaty, which updates the exchange-of-information provisions; and the agreement with Jersey on the allocation of taxing rights over certain income. Australia shares an exceptionally close relationship with New Zealand. The tax treaty further enhances this relationship by reducing tax impediments to the cross-border movement of people, capital and technology by facilitating cooperation between taxation authorities to reduce tax evasion and by providing increased legal and fiscal certainty for commerce between the two countries. The enhanced exchange-of-information provisions in the second protocol to the Belgian tax treaty will be an important tool in Australia’s effort to combat offshore tax evasion. The enhanced provisions will allow the exchange of information on a wider range of taxes in a wider range of circumstances. This will discourage taxpayers from participating in abusive tax arrangements by increasing the probability of detection, making it harder for it taxpayers to evade Australian tax. The agreement with Jersey was signed in conjunction with a tax information exchange agreement. The agreement on the allocation of taxing rights over certain income will help to prevent double taxation. The tax information exchange agreement between Australia and Jersey will facilitate the exchange of tax information between Jersey and Australia, once again discouraging taxpayers from participating in abusive tax arrangements. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.","17"

"N/A","The document goes on to list these priority industry capabilities, and under the heading ‘What are the PICs?’ the very last dot point is, lo and behold, ‘Combat Clothing and Personal Equipment’. So the minister himself, in allowing the department to authorise the sourcing of camouflage fabric from overseas, is actually defying his own policy guidelines. You have to wonder if this is sheer incompetence or whether it is the result of a government that has driven this nation into record debt and deficit and is now penny-pinching and scrimping to try and save a few dollars here and there. How much are we going to save? It was revealed in Senate estimates today that the Chinese tender was only 10 per cent cheaper than the Australian tender and that was only going to save Defence $1.5 million. Think of all the money that has been wasted with the home insulation program and all the rorting that has occurred there. Think of all those school halls that schools never wanted and had been tendered at very high prices. Think of all the waste of money going overseas that was supposed to stimulate the Australian economy. And yet this government was going to jeopardise the security of Australian servicemen and women by having this highly developed fabric produced by an overseas power. It just goes to show their priorities and their desperation in trying to retrieve some economic credibility. It is not just this pointless exercise in penny-pinching. This fabric, developed by Bruck Textiles in my electorate, in conjunction with Defence, does have very special spectral qualities. Australian taxpayers’ dollars have been invested in the development of this wonderful innovation, and this money was going to effectively be exported overseas. The government needs to stand accountable. The Minister for Defence needs to answer the questions: why did he allow this to happen in the first place and what other Defence contracts does the minister know about in his department that jeopardise Australian jobs and Australian industries? I will be pursuing the answers to these questions. These issues are of concern not only to people in my electorate but to people right around Australia. Minister, you will not be able to escape answering these questions indefinitely.","12"

I know that her bravery, her strength and her dedication to her students has been an inspiration for so many in the local school community. The school has established scholarship awards in Mitsuko Hodgen’s memory.

The minister said that without the My School information, the federal government would never have known these 110 schools had large numbers of students that required the additional assistance. I welcome the announcement to cross-reference state data with federal data. I think there are obvious statistical discrepancies, such as the comparison between a local school, Bulli High School, and Trinity Grammar—and of course we all wait for the information about resource allocation, which ultimately can only stand to benefit students in disadvantaged schools.","12"

The member for Perth recounted very calmly the number of police prosecutions against people who have attacked Indian visitors in Australia or Indian-Australian citizens.

"N/A","Although I may not agree with a lot of what the Whitlam government said and did, I certainly agree with that statement. Thirty-eight years after Gough Whitlam said that, it is unfulfilled. There are still today Indigenous communities right across Australia and other communities in country areas where such education is not available to our youngest. In 1989, Bob Hawke promised that one billion trees would be planted. Do we know—has there been a check—whether those one billion trees were planted? I would put to you that the Howard government’s program of funding Landcare planted far more trees than we could ever imagine and that was people power in action. Once again, this was a promise which has not been fulfilled that we know of—unless there has been an audit. Before the 2007 election Prime Minister Rudd promised new leadership and a new future. He held up a computer and said, ‘There’ll be one of these in every child’s hands by 2011’—next year. When questioned by young people, the Prime Minister said:","12"

When we as politicians make commitments before an election about what we are going to do, there should be an integrity check on the promises that we make to the Australian people; otherwise, we let them down badly. When a Prime Minister or any of us are checked like that, we have a responsibility. If we make a promise to the Australian people in an election campaign just for their green vote, like Bob Hawke in 1989, and then do not fulfil that promises, we should be called to account. And the only way we can be called to account is by the people on election day.","12"

"HWG","I rise today to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010 . These bills appropriate funding for government decisions included in the Mid-Year Economic and Financial Outlook and decisions made since its release. Last Wednesday was the anniversary of the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, and I think it is worth reflecting on how our nation has fared over these last 12 months. I think it is also worth reflecting on the very clear delineation of economic policy that the stimulus policy has made stark in Australian politics. On the one hand we have the government’s response—to take timely and effective action in the face of the most serious financial and economic crisis that the world has faced in more than 75 years. It is a response by a government that was prepared to use the full range of policy tools at its disposal: fiscal policy, both through transfer payments and government investment in infrastructure; monetary policy; financial regulation and intervention in financial markets; and international trade and finance policies. It is a response that has involved the federal government working with other nations, with the state governments, with local governments and with businesses to craft a response that would protect and strengthen Australia’s economy now and in the future. Fundamentally we have a government that understood that to contain the damage caused by the meltdown in global financial markets we had to maintain confidence in our financial system, encourage households to maintain consumption and provide businesses with the certainty and confidence to continue investing. On the other hand and in very stark contrast we had the opposition’s reaction. The Liberal and National parties opposed the infrastructure stimulus package at the height of the global financial crisis and have continued to oppose the stimulus package since. We have had the new Leader of the Opposition saying in the last day or two that the stimulus was a waste of money. We have had the new opposition leader saying in the clearest possible terms that it is the intention of the Liberal and National parties to stop the stimulus. That provides the clearest possible contrast. We have an opposition that would, by stopping the stimulus, stop economic policy which is supporting thousands of jobs, supporting tradies and small businesses across Australia and supporting thousands of Australian working families. As I say, the contrast could not have been clearer. And now, as Australia makes its way through this crisis, we are beginning to see the effects of the government’s response. The response has helped to maintain and rebuild confidence in the Australian financial system, it has helped to sustain consumer and business confidence and the government has made up for the decline in business investment and household consumption by injecting significant government spending into the economy. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook included significant upgrades in economic growth compared to the budget forecast for financial year 2009-10, which improved from negative 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Forecasts for 2010-11 improved from 2.25 per cent to 2.75 per cent. The fiscal stimulus added around one percentage point to GDP growth in 2008-09 and should add 1.5 per cent to GDP growth in this financial year. According to the Mid-Year Economic and Financial Outlook, private demand will contract by 0.75 per cent rather than the four per cent in the budget forecast. Australia has managed to avoid a recession through the worst global downturn in more than 75 years. Australia’s economy is the only advanced economy that expanded in the year to June 2009. According to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook update, Australia’s economic growth was positive, and Australia was the only advanced economy to achieve this. No major Australian financial institution collapsed; none required government to take significant shareholdings in return for dealing with toxic debt; nor were any nationalised. This can be contrasted with the situation in the United Kingdom, where the government has nationalised Northern Rock and taken significant shareholdings in Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Most importantly, the government’s response to the global economic crisis has helped to protect hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs. Unemployment is now expected to reach around 6.75 per cent. This is 1.5 per cent lower than it is estimated would have occurred without the stimulus. It is now clear—if there was ever any doubt—that the government’s response has been the correct response. It has left the opposition with no credibility on economic matters. On 12 October 2008, in the days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Australian government took the first steps to secure Australia’s economic position in the face of a rapidly deteriorating situation in global financial markets. Through the guarantee scheme for large deposits and wholesale funding, and the financial claims scheme, the Australian government made it clear that it would ensure confidence in our financial institutions was maintained. These measures ensured continued consumer confidence in our financial sector and guaranteed that Australian banks would still be able to access global capital markets—in particular, to rollover debt that was falling due. Without the guarantees that the government provided, financing for business investment would have dried up, interest rates would have been higher and we would have seen a sharp contraction in economic activity and a resulting loss of jobs for Australian workers. The very next day, 13 October 2008, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy, which would become the first part of the government’s program of economic stimulus. It contained $4.8 billion for immediate financial assistance to Australia’s four million pensioners, carers and seniors; $3.9 billion for low- and middle-income families; $1.5 billion for the first home owners boost; and $187 million to create 56,000 new training places in 2008-09. It also brought forward significant investment in nation-building infrastructure projects to 2009. This first initial boost to the economy focused significant transfer payments to those most in need and most likely to inject that money straight back into the economy—pensioners, carers, seniors and low- and middle-income families. It provided significant help for the building and construction industry as well as for first home buyers seeking finance in the midst of a drastic credit tightening by Australian banks. It helped to boost economic activity by bringing forward the government’s investment in infrastructure to make up for the failure of the Howard government in dealing with the capacity constraints during the boom. As the global economic situation deteriorated, the first stimulus the government announced was followed in February 2009 by the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. We had the anniversary of that plan, that infrastructure stimulus, just last week. Key details of this plan included $12.2 billion in one-off cash payments and $29.9 billion in shovel-ready infrastructure projects, including investing $14.7 billion in schools across Australia; $8.5 billion in critical road, rail and port infrastructure; $4.5 billion in the Clean Energy Initiative; $2.6 billion in the Education Investment Fund; and $3.2 billion in the Health and Hospitals Fund. The final element was investing more than $1 billion in the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, which is the largest one-off investment in local infrastructure in Australia’s history. Locally, in our community, what this infrastructure program has meant is large local council projects. A key example is the complete rebuilding of the Noble Park pool, which is now over 50 years old. That coincides very happily with the centenary of the community of Noble Park. The complete refurbishment of the Noble Park pool is a long overdue local project. The federal government funding is in the order of $7 million, and to that is going to be added a contribution from the City of Greater Dandenong and a contribution from the state government from its Better Pools program. What you see there are the three spheres of government—local, state and federal—working very cooperatively together to produce a community project which has been long awaited and is much needed. The work on that Noble Park pool refurbishment is well underway and will provide very direct benefits to the whole of our local community in Noble Park. The other major council in my electorate, the City of Kingston, received funding for the refurbishment of the Kingston Heath soccer facility—a project of over $2 million, provided through Commonwealth funding through the Regional and Local Infrastructure Program. Again, the works at Kingston Heath soccer facility are well underway. It is a much used and much valued local facility, used by soccer clubs from across south-east Melbourne, and the refurbishment of it is going to make a very substantial contribution to the sporting facilities in our area. The two main councils in my electorate, the City of Kingston and the City of Greater Dandenong, as well as the City of Frankston—which is responsible for the Carrum Downs area in the south of the Isaacs electorate—have all embarked on a range of smaller infrastructure projects, which have been funded by the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. Many of those smaller projects have already been completed or are well underway. I could mention a couple: the opening in January of the refurbished Tatterson Park, with a very extensive playground, in Keysborough, which is a City of Greater Dandenong Project; and the extension of bike paths in and to Braeside Park in the City of Kingston—notably, bike paths from Waterways to Braeside Park. Again, these are much needed and much welcomed local projects that the local councils have been able to undertake with the assistance of Commonwealth government funding. The schools projects, which have been funded by the Building the Education Revolution funding, have produced construction programs in every primary school in my electorate. The projects that have been undertaken at every primary school in my electorate are all welcome. They are all now underway and some of them are on the point of completion. I think the first primary school in my electorate that is going to complete its Building the Education Revolution project will be St Joachim’s in Carrum Downs. They have built a truly excellent school hall, which has already been welcomed by the whole of the school community. It is a facility that St Joachim’s, in the Catholic system, thought that it was never going to be able to build, and it is a hall that is going to provide a terrific facility for not only the school community but the wider local community as well. Other primary schools have embarked on the construction of classroom complexes. Again, many of the school principals, school council presidents and parents throughout my electorate have said to me over and over again over the last year how pleased they are at the building works being undertaken. They know very directly the support that these building projects at primary schools have provided for local tradies, in the creation of thousands of jobs through this program, and the great benefits which will flow from the construction of classrooms and halls—which primarily is what is being constructed—at each of the primary schools in our electorate. They are in no doubt as to the timeliness of the economic stimulus and the long-term worth of what is being constructed with the Commonwealth government funding. Returning to the national level, according to the latest Global Economic Prospects from the World Bank, the worst of the global economic crisis is behind us. Although this can provide some confidence, it should not allow complacency. The opposition, having opposed the effective and timely economic response of the government, is now demanding that that response, the stimulus, be withdrawn. That can be contrasted with the comments that have been made by economists across the world. To pick one, notably the International Monetary Fund in the November edition of Cross-Country Fiscal Monitor called for countries to maintain fiscal support but to devise credible exit strategies. That is precisely what the Rudd government has done. In contrast to the opposition—and the contrast could not be greater—the government has a clear and properly communicated strategy to withdraw the stimulus progressively as private demand recovers. As Peter Anderson, Chief Executive of ACCI, has said ‘an in-built scaling down of economic support is preferable to sudden withdrawal’. There should be no doubt as to how the infrastructure funding provided by the stimulus package has been able to step in to take the place of a downturn in construction activity in a whole range of sectors across Australia. You have only to look at the construction figures in different sectors of the economy to see just what a downturn there was and to readily understand that, if the government had not stepped into the breach and provided this infrastructure funding, there would have been a disaster for the Australian construction industry, with the direct loss of thousands of jobs and the direct removal of support for thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Australian working families. You can contrast the steady, measured and decisive approach of the government with the immense risks to the Australian economy which the opposition presents. It is a contrast between the Rudd government building a stronger economy for Australian working families and an economic team that could best be described as a rabble, an economic team which cannot even agree among themselves—highlighted by the extraordinary statements made by the opposition’s finance spokesman, Senator Joyce, just yesterday. Commenting on debt, Senator Joyce said:","17"

"HWA","I rise today to support the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010 . These two bills provide timely funding for numerous very successful government programs, schemes and funds, with the appropriations being sought amounting to a little over $2 billion. A lot of these projects have been part of the federal government’s successful stimulus plan. Our nation-building plan has been very successful and widely appreciated, certainly in my electorate of Kingston. Only two weeks ago I went with the Minister for Housing to visit some of the projects that are happening on the ground in the area of social housing. We visited 16 houses being instructed in Hackham—a lovely suburb—and these houses are well on their way. I visited this location with the minister only six months before, and at that time it was an empty block waiting for construction. At that time, we met with the company organising the construction of these houses. Six months later, we are seeing houses having their kitchens put in, the plastering done, the insulation put in and very soon will be ready for the first tenants to move in. This is an incredibly successful scheme not only because it has provided much-needed housing in my local area but also because it has provided an economic stimulus and has supported jobs. When I visited there six months ago, we discussed with the project managers, Quattro, that we wanted to ensure that local people were employed. So I was very pleased to have a visit from the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator Mark Arbib. He came down and had a ‘keep Kingston working’ forum. As a result of this, we saw on the worksite, only a few weeks ago, local tradespeople—local kitchen makers from Lonsdale, local tradies from Aldinga—all working on this project. They were all getting work because of the government stimulus strategy. So I think that was an exciting project and I thank the Minister for Housing for attending that. While the minister was in the electorate of Kingston, we also visited Southern Junction Community Services, a very reputable non-government organisation providing housing to people most in need. I do note that Appropriation Bill No. 3 provides an additional close to $20 million to the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for payments under the Rental Affordability Scheme. The Rental Affordability Scheme is a particularly important scheme for electorates such as Kingston where we are seeing that the affordability of rent—and I have spoken about this many times in the parliament—is becoming out of reach. We do know that when the cost of rent or repayments exceeds 30 per cent of someone’s income they are under housing stress. I meet people day after day in my electorate who do feel housing stress, so I was very pleased that, when the Minister for Housing was down, we were able to visit Southern Junction Community Services in an area where the scheme will deliver 83 new affordable rental homes in Adelaide’s southern suburbs by 2011. We met with Graham Brown and his board of Southern Junction Community Services and we were able to discuss exactly how this was going to impact on people within our community, particularly looking at people under housing stress whether they be families or young people in southern Adelaide. These houses will have a significant impact and deliver some great outcomes. The 83 homes being built will include a mix of studio apartments, two- and three-bedroom townhouses and three-bedroom houses. This is really important because in the southern suburbs of Adelaide we have often seen that housing availability has not always accommodated the different types of households looking for it. In some areas there is not enough housing for individuals—single person houses—and in other places there is not enough housing for families. These houses are really important and they will be rented out at least 20 per cent below the market price to tenants who meet eligibility criteria. The financial pressure caused by high rental prices is something which is hurting low- and moderate-income earners around Australia. The additional funding proposed in this bill is required due to the larger than expected number of charities and non-government organisations, such as Southern Junction Community Services, seeking to participate in the scheme. The previous government really did nothing when it came to housing affordability. I know that this was an increasing issue in my local electorate. Certainly, people in my electorate have welcomed the very practical and positive things that this government has done. There is the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which I have mentioned, and also the social housing under the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. These two things are really making a difference on the ground in Kingston. Appropriation Bill No. 3 also proposes to bring forward $290 million from 2011-12 for the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts to meet the increase in demand for the Home Insulation Program which is, once again, part of our practical solution to dealing with the financial crisis. This program offers up to $1,200 in ceiling insulation to owner-occupiers, landlords and tenants. Having opened on 1 July 2009, this has been an incredibly popular program that many people have taken up. To illustrate how popular it has been, as at November last year take-up of the government’s Energy Efficient Homes package saw ceiling insulation provided for over 600,000 Australian households and around another 100,000 households took up the solar hot water package. This compares to the previous government where only 4,000 people took up the solar hot water rebate. This government has seen where there is a need. It has looked at it in a time where we needed to actually do something that not only stimulated jobs and interest in the short term but also in the long term. These programs will help many people to cut their electricity bills. I think that this is really important. We have seen in South Australia just how hot it can get. Last year we had record heatwaves. This year we have certainly had many days over 43 degrees. This does produce significant stress especially on the elderly. We saw in the 2008-09 heatwaves that people had a lot of complications and found it very difficult to keep cool in their own homes. Certainly, a number of people have approached me who do not have insulation and cannot afford air-conditioning. Enabling these people to put insulation into their homes will be particularly important. The Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010 also proposes an extra $510 million for the Solar Homes and Communities Plan. This program will be replaced by the solar credit scheme, but they both provide assistance to households, small businesses and community groups for the cost of installing solar panels on their roofs. Once again, this has been a particularly exciting and well taken up program. I know that the opposition will say, ‘Well, it was our program.’ But let us just contrast how many people have taken this up in the two years that we have been in government. In less than two years, as of November, the government was on track to fund more than 120,000 installations of solar panels. This compares to just 10,000 rebates funded over the entire period of the previous government. This is another example of where this government is taking practical action to help people reduce their energy costs and to let them feel like they are making a contribution to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. I do know, despite what the opposition might have us believe, that people are concerned about climate change. They do want to do their bit to reduce carbon emissions, and the assistance through the government’s energy efficient home package and the solar credit scheme will specifically do that. Specifically, $40 million will also be provided to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to meet the increasing demands of general employee entitlements and the redundancy scheme caused by the significant increase in bankruptcies and insolvencies. I have spoken about this before, and I anticipate that the reforms in the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 will pass through the Senate committee process. Additionally, this bill provides more remedial assistance to those affected by the provisions in this bill. Finally, these appropriations bills propose an additional $12.5 million for the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for the Local Government Reform Fund. This will allow the fund to continue helping councils to manage their infrastructure plans for the future and will assist in the construction of community buildings such as libraries, community centres, sports grounds and environmental infrastructure. I make the point that this is really important for electorates like the electorate of Kingston. It is an outer metropolitan electorate where a lot of the community infrastructure was built perhaps 30 or 40 years ago, and nothing has really been done on that community infrastructure since. So 40 years later we see infrastructure that is ageing and—unfortunately for the local council—it is in need of repair and update all at the same time because it was all built at the same time. This is causing significant concern for the council and also shows that when infrastructure is built it does need a plan for how you are going to update it, because 30 years does come around pretty quickly. In my electorate we see the need for significant upgrades in community infrastructure but, at the same time as the infrastructure that was built 30 years ago needs updating, we also see new suburbs being built that are in desperate need of this sort of community infrastructure. Once again, the government’s Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan did provide significant money to enable a lot of local community infrastructure. I was very pleased to see that the council put that money into things in my electorate such as upgrading footpaths, which were in dire need of upgrading or, in fact, needed to be put in. It sounds like a very small thing, but not having footpaths is a really difficult thing, whether for parents trying to walk around pushing prams, or for older people in their gophers. Footpaths are just a basic thing to be provided, and I take this opportunity to reflect what my constituents are saying. Whether it is local or state government, these footpaths really do need to be made a priority. So I am very pleased that the money that the federal government gives will really help local government plan for the future in terms of infrastructure. I just want to note that footpaths really need to be one of those things. In conclusion, it is important that we pass these appropriation bills in a timely fashion because they will provide money to some significantly popular programs that are creating some real stimulus in the economy. We know that the opposition wants to pull the rug out from under the stimulus, but these programs are on the ground, helping to ensure that people remain employed and building some significant benefits for the future of Australia. I commend the bills to the House.","17"

"IYS","(1) As at 14 September 2009, what was the financial cost for evidence collection and analysis by the Department of Public Prosecutions and Australian Federal Police for the case of Mr Guy Campos, including the cost of trips to East Timor and witness interviews? (2) Will the inquiry be completed; if so, will it be completed using any tools available to the Government? (3) Can he confirm that Australia is internationally obliged to pursue the matter in line with the 1949 Geneva Conventions? (4) What efforts are being undertaken to keep Mr Campos in Australia given his temporary visa expires on 18 September 2009, and the evidence so far gathered suggests that he may be open to prosecution as a war criminal.","17"
"00AN3","(1) The AFP investigation into the matter of Mr Campos was conducted over the course of more than a year and involved complex inquiries into historical matters spanning several countries including Australia, East Timor and the United States. Up until 31 August 2009, the cost of the AFP investigation in Australia and abroad totalled $430,948. AFP travel costs to East Timor amount to $18,396. The costs associated with witness interviews are part of the overall cost of an AFP investigation. Up until 31 August 2009, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) had not paid any external costs for evidence collection and analysis. Since then accounts have been paid for legal advice totalling $13,420 including GST. No CDPP officers have travelled to East Timor. (2) The AFP investigation in this matter related to offences under the Crimes (Torture) Act 1988 for alleged conduct committed by Mr Campos in East Timor during the 1990s. As Mr Campos is not an Australian citizen, and as he is no longer present in Australia, he is unable to be charged in Australia under the Crimes (Torture) Act. I am advised that for these reasons the AFP investigation into these matters is not continuing. (3) The Geneva Conventions of 1949 impose an obligation on all States to prosecute or extradite a person alleged to have engaged in conduct that amounts to a ‘grave breach’ (within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions), where a prima facie case is established. It would not be appropriate to comment on whether the conduct alleged against Mr Campos amounts to a ‘grave breach’ within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions, as this would involve the provision of legal advice on a specific case. (4) Before his voluntary departure from Australia, Mr Campos was lawfully present in Australia on a bridging visa. The AFP investigation into these matters involved extensive inquiries in Australia and East Timor and the investigation was ongoing at the time of Mr Campos’ departure. The only lawful means for preventing Mr Campos from departing Australia before the expiration of his visa would have been to arrest him. However, I am advised that the AFP did not have sufficient evidence to proceed with any charge against Mr Campos at that time. (4) As Mr Campos was not at any time present in Australia as an unlawful non-citizen, it was not possible for the Attorney-General to consider whether or not to issue a Criminal Justice Stay Certificate to stay his removal under the Migration Act 1958 . In any case, where a Criminal Justice Stay Certificate is issued, it does not prevent a person from leaving Australia voluntarily.","17"
"JK6","The statement of principles referred to in Ms Bishop’s question is not in fact a statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The statement was actually adopted by the G8 at a meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Washington DC on 11 May 2004. This G8 statement of principles is, however, posted on UNHCR’s Refworld site. The Refworld site is a refugee decision support reference site, containing a collection of reports relating to situations in countries of origin, policy documents and positions, and documents relating to international and national legal frameworks. Australia is under no obligation to align its screening processes with those outlined in the G8 document. However, the principle of close cooperation between countries processing applications from asylum seekers to protect these processes from abuse by people who have been involved in terrorist activities as outlined in the G8 statement is one with which Australia strongly concurs. To this end, Australia has developed strong relationships and information sharing practices with a number of countries, taking into account asylum seekers’ legitimate confidentiality and privacy interests, to ensure that people involved in terrorist activities are not afforded undeserved protection through the refugee status assessment process. An example of these information sharing practices is that earlier this year, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that Australia has signed an agreement for biometric data sharing between Australia, Canada and the UK. Under this partnership, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will be able to securely and confidentially cross check fingerprints with Canadian and UK databases. These data sharing arrangements will allow DIAC to undertake more detailed identity enquiries if necessary, and to confirm if a client has had dealings with these countries. This will increase the chance of detecting persons of concern in immigration caseloads. The range of background checks undertaken by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship includes identity and character checks which include penal checks, where possible, with all countries in which the client has resided for more than 12 months during the previous 10 years. Australia also conducts background checks in relation to national security and counter terrorism. However, DIAC is not responsible for the processing of these checks other than to provide relevant information to the competent authority, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.","17"
