"The mass of electors would feel more confidence in Mr. Menzies as a leader, if they were convinced - and they by no means are convinced - that he means to place national needs before party exigencies.  The country is by no means satisfied that the Menzies' Government possesses either the vigour or efficiency which is needed to carry our war effort into top gear. For one thing, there lias been far too much wrangling and indecision within Cabinet itself. ... If the confidence of the country is to be securely held, the stamp of mediocrity upon the Ministry's general complexion and character must be removed. ... It has been a year of delays, a lack of policy, and of repeated shirking of responsibility."
"The Navy was at the highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable exploits of some of its ships overseas. The home defence army was well trained, and its equipment had been greatly improved. The strength of the Air Force had been largely increased, both in respect of home defence squadrons and the training resources of the Empire Air Scheme. The equipment of the Air Force had also been much improved."
"On the Wednesd a y fixed upon, you will be expected to show that, under a strong provocation, willing a general holiday, you shall have it in the teeth of a lying press and a recreant Parliament. Not a cab, bus, tram or train should run, not a ship should sail, not a shop or factory or hotel or theatre should be open; not a newspaper should come out: not a butcher's, baker's or grocer's cart should be seen in the streets; not a man of the all- powerful working class should be at work. Will you, as a unionist, help in the success of this policy? It is a policy for the protection and preservation of trades unionism, with all that it implies in better wages and conditions through the glorious gospel and might of organization."
"Hear, hear!"
"I do not say that it is. The suggestion by the honorable member for New England that there had been some failure by us to meet the implied obligations of Australia as one of the leading nations engaged in the South-west Pacific Area cannot be supported. Every requisition for the movement of forces or material made upon this Government has been complied with. In the face of this no one should decry what Australia has done, is doing, and will do to achieve final victory.  I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there should be no question of party in this matter, but the Leader of the Opposition fails to answer the Prime Minister's case which is - That for a substantial period of time ahead the man-power resources of the country do not permit of the employment of the Militia to an extent greater than is suggested in the proposed boundary. That this boundary will not limit in any way the utilization of other Australian service units wherever they can best serve the Allied cause. The present strategic plan for the theatre of war in which Australia has a very special responsibility and interest suggests further concentration of our human and material resources within that area, with two objectives - preserving Australia against invasion, and carrying out Australia's part in any offensives that may from time to time be determined. The Government, especially the Minister for Defence, is the best judge of what the security of the country requires and permits. In. his considered opinion the present plan offers a practicable solution of a difficult and delicate problem. Its adoption does not prejudice future revision by Parliament of the plan. At the present I submit that the plan should be followed. There are two fundamental principles which are carried into effect by the bill - first, the present plan fulfils all the needs of General MacArthur's strategy not only for the present but also for a substantial period ahead of us. These needs are not measured in any niggardly way. The extended area is a vast one and those who measure it on Mercator's- projection will be grievously misled. Equally, it is wrong to hold out the chimera of an immediate conquest of the vast area which is embraced by the present proposal. Grandiose schemes not based on any realistic and practical or common sense assessment of the agreed strategy and our present resources, and the available allied resorces, will turn out to be a delusion and a snare, and may lead to utter disaster to a young nation, the war effort of which has been magnificent. In these matters what is practical and possible is also what is best. The present task set us is a great and noble one; let us unite to perform it."
"That is no matter for the Government to consider. I definitely accept - one can do nothing else - the general principle that whatever government may be in power it will ensure that, as far as- possible our hold on this country shall, not be reduced to such n point that- it will be in danger. Obviously, opinions may differ as to what that point is. Whether the Government bo composed of honorable members who sit on this side of the House, a national government, or a Labour government, it will look first to its own defence; but if it to make its own defence an excuse for not sending troops out of Australia, no taking an adequate part in war operations, then the whole thing must break down in the eyes of the world."
"The transfer of workers from one industry to another should be on the approved basis of a greater need for skilled tradesmen in another factory or a greater concentration of men in order to stimulate production of a certain kind. Unfortunately, at the present time, transfers are effected to allow employees to get higher wages."
"1, 2, 4 and 5.The information sought by the honorable member in these questions is obtainable from the ordinary State Governmental Departments which record and deal with such matters.  3. Mr. Newman, in his capacity as Controller of Minerals Production, furnishes recommendations regarding the minerals position generally. If the honorable member has any suggestion that Mr. Newman's interests in mining companies conflict with his duties to the Commonwealth and will furnish particulars, I will be only too glad to have the matter investigated. 6.None. 7.See reply to 6. 8, 9 and 10.- The location, nature and extent and quantities of minerals being produced constitute evidence of the Government's activities in this important field and it is considered inadvisable that it should be made public at this time. If the honorable member is interested in any particular aspect I will be glad to furnish particulars to him for his confidential information."
