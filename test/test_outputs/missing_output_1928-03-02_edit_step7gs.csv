"There is no need for panic. All we need to do is to eliminate strikes and adopt efficient methods. This is imperative in the interests of the masses. We have been told by the  Reds, who are still leading sections of the Labour party, that the strike is the thing, but not the strike as it was formerly known. The policy of the  Reds  is to withdraw one man from this ship, and one from another, and so tie up operations on the waterfront. They have been doing this incessantly until we have reached a critical condition. We do not need any lessons on this score from the Northern Territory, although we know what happened there when the honorable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson) was partly instrumental in deporting Government officials from Darwin."
"That is so, and unfortunately some unscrupulous employers take advantage of the plight of these foreign migrants. Many of them, according to consular reports, have to work for their ' keep.' The Government is to be condemned for the ineffective protection afforded to Australian industries by the existing tariff schedule. We have practically an unlimited supply of the raw materials for many industries. If we utilized our raw materials for the metal and textile industries, there should not be a single person unemployed in Australia who was willing to work. In those two industries alone, we should be able to provide employment for all our own people and a considerable number from abroad. The Prime Minister in his speech the other day gave one the impression that he was addressing shareholders of an importing firm. He declared that the Government intended to protect Australian industries. Unfortunately, while we are waiting for that protection our people are suffering through unemployment. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) yesterday had something to say about a number of industries which he assured us were to be established in Australia as a result of the. tariff protection afforded by this Government. I agree with the Minister as to the wisdom of British manufacturers establishing branch houses in the Commonwealth so that Australian requirements may be met by manufacturing concerns within the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, many overseas visitors who come to Australia on industrial missions have a hazy idea as to what Australia should or should not do in the way of manufacturing. Lately, Mr. W. R. Morris, the well-known British motor manufacturer, has been giving us the benefit of his views. I can assure him that, if he cannot wholly manufacture cars in Australia, he will find that American competitors will do so and oust him from the Australian market. Not long ago, in my electorate I had an interview with Sir Henry Cowan who, as honorable members are aware, has been a member of the British House of Commons for twenty years, and has been associated with business concerns in Australia for 40 years. As Ave were parting I gave him a final message, telling him to advise British manufacturers that if they wished to secure the Australian trade they must be prepared to establish themselves in Australia, otherwise Australian requirements would be met by manufacturing concerns backed with American capital. Henry Ford has established works in Australia, and he is the forerunner of others who are now making inquiries here. Sir Henry Cowan informed me that he agreed with my view, and that he would do all in his power to impress upon his brother manufacturers in Great Britain the need to establish works in Australia. The Minister for Trade and Customs only yesterday said that before long huge railway engines would be built by our' engineering works in New South Wales. Why, he is behind the times! South Australia is to be congratulated upon importing the Pacific and Mountain types of locomotives, although I would prefer it to obtain models from America and to build its engines in its own works."
"Unemployment is such a poignant factor in both individual and national tragedy, and it means such irrecoverable waste of forces and materials both of production and civilization that this House would be justified, even had it not the specific power to deal with the causes of unemployment, to examine them at length. The discussion of the motion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton), has led to the statement of what the Labour party considers to be some of the causes of unemployment. I shall examine the case so presented and show conclusively, that what are alleged to he causes have nothing at all to do with unemployment. The motion deals with unrestrained migration, the curtailment of public expenditure, and the Governments alleged failure to assist industry. These are not real but bogus charges, brought \vp at this time for electioneering purposes. The policy of the present Administration, since it was constituted some five. years ago, has been to aim at the maximum amount of employment for the people of Australia, under conditions which will -not merely give them decent standards of living but also attract migrants of the best class to this country, and thus enable us to work out our own destiny. In my opinion, one of the most potent causes of the present unemployment is the tyranny exercised by the extremist leaders of the labour unions, who dictate to the unions a policy that, although consistently denounced at first by the same political leaders of Labour in both State and Federal spheres, has in the end been adopted because of the cowardice of some and the folly of other politicians. As a result of the operation of this extremist policy, and the political leaders acquiescence in it, ruin is facing many thousands in Australia to-day.  After the war industrial problems arose in practically every country in the world, but they have generally been solved by the co-operation of labour and capital, by an improvement in technique, and particularly by a stimulation of the morale of the workers in order to secure increased production which means an increased wages fund, and further employment. In Australia, however, the extremists have defeated every effort made by the Government to secure industrial peace and cooperation, and in so doing have exercised a tyranny which is almost unspeakable, and is reminiscent of the worst days of persecution in the history of the world. Not only have these extremists exerted pressure upon the political leaders of labour, but they have punished even honorable members in this House for holding to their opinions, and have crucified them for their convictions and their refusal to immediately bow the knee and accept other doctrines. Let me give four instances of such conduct within the last two or three years. In 1926 the industrial referendum was taken. It will be remembered that the leaders of the Labour party in this House said that although the proposals then submitted were not all that they desired, they were a considerable step in the right direction. They voted for the Governments proposals in this House, and said they would support them in the country. It is to the honour of the Leader of the Opposition and of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that they did this. But although the proposals had been endorsed in great part by the Labour movement, and had been a part  of its platform . for years, the extreme industrialists disregarded that endorsement, and conducted a vigorous propaganda which led to the defeat of the referendum. The members of the Labour party who stuck to their convictions were threatened with expulsion from the Labour movement and prevented from speaking publicly. That is a condition of things such as prevailed in the dark ages, when men were burned at the stake for their opinions. No one would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition and his supporters have ever been guilty of treachery to the principles of the Labour movement, yet for their stand on the referendum they were threatened with expulsion by the extremists leaders. Many Labour men at that time, not having the courage to stick to their convictions, weakly bowed the knee to the extremists, and assisted them to defeat the Governments proposals. Then there was the industrial mission to America. The appointment of that commission was recognized throughout Australia as a wise step, and the Governments proposals received support from the Trades and Labour Councils. In fact the councils nominated several of their members, including Mr. Jock Garden, to the commission. Because the Government refused to accept those nominations, and accepted instead those submitted by other unionists of Australia, the labour members of the Industrial Mission when they returned to Australia were persecuted by the extremists. One man in Adelaide was hounded from his job simply because he had had the courage to join the mission and to go to America to try to do something for his country. Another member, Miss May Matthews, who had been a labour worker for twenty years, has been denied the right to stand for pre-selection, and therefore cannot be a labour candidate at the next elections. She is being penalized for having had the courage to go to America, and by her observations there, to try to bring back information leading to the betterment of industrial conditions and the establishment of industrial peace in Australia. A similar position has arisen in connexion with the industrial peace conference which the Prime Minister proposes to convene in the near future. It remains for the future to show whether the cowardice that has characterized the so-called representatives of Labour hitherto will continue, or whether they will get courage to say that the movement towards the co-operation of capital and labour should be supported, so that production may he increased, the wages fund augmented and employment made plentiful. Let us take another illustration of the manner in which extremists dominate the Labour party, to the injury of the workers. Some time ago the Arbitration Court said definitely that it would grant a working week of 44 hours in particular industries, if certain conditions were observed, so as to ensure that production would be maintained at the existing level. The court pointed out that in its opinion that result could be brought about only by the adoption of piece work. What is the attitude of the extreme men in the industrial movement towards that system? It is shown by the recent statement of Mr. Chapman, secretary of the Railways Union of New South Wales. The court was appointed to give justice to both sides in industry, and admittedly it impartially considers the cases brought before it. Yet Mr. Chapman has said -"
"Mr. Bruce said that it was the survey of the position in the dried fruits industry by the commission which brought matters to a' head. The commission reported that the condition of the world's market for dried fruit had reached saturation point, and that the plans made originally on the basis of extensive developments in this industry must go by the board.  Mr. Bruce said that the investigations of the commission had also shown that a similar parlous condition of over-production existed in the canned fruit industry throughout the world."
