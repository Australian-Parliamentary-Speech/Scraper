"There is no need for panic. All we need to do is to eliminate strikes and adopt efficient methods. This is imperative in the interests of the masses. We have been told by the  Reds, who are still leading sections of the Labour party, that the strike is the thing, but not the strike as it was formerly known. The policy of the  Reds  is to withdraw one man from this ship, and one from another, and so tie up operations on the waterfront. They have been doing this incessantly until we have reached a critical condition. We do not need any lessons on this score from the Northern Territory, although we know what happened there when the honorable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson) was partly instrumental in deporting Government officials from Darwin."
"The honorable member is out of touch with the workers, in our big industrial centres in particular, and his interjection shows his ignorance of the true facts of the situation. There is no subject that this National Parliament should devote its attention to more closely at this time than that of unemployment. We should do our utmost to find work for the idle hands that are in every State in the Commonwealth. To have 100,000 work people out of employment means that at least 400,000 persons are directly affected as to their means of livelihood. Many others are indirectly affected.  But apart from the sufferings of the people - and they are bad enough in all conscience - there is the serious financial loss that this unemployment means to the country. The present condition of our employment market means that we are losing at least £15,600,000 per annum, and as this state of affairs has existed for the last six months, we have already lost between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000. If we add to that the accumulated wealth created by those employed on productive works it means that within twelve months this country will lose no less than £31,200,000. Prom a financial viewpoint alone, gauging it by the lowest possible standards and disregarding human suffering, Australia stands to lose the enormous sum I have just mentioned. When this country is losing so much through unemployment, why does the Prime Minister hesitate to put in hand works which should be undertaken? We are told by honorable members opposite that it is not the duty of the Commonwealth to provide employment for the workers; but I should mention one instance at least in which the Commonwealth should spend money and thus assist in relieving the situation. According to official figures, the Government has, since the Estimates were passed, made a saving of £1,375,000. I do not suggest that all the money voted should be spent, but some works which have been authorized should be undertaken. I refer more particularly to an amount of £333,000 in the Postmaster-General's estimates, which should be expended during this financial year in carrying out essential work. Everyone agrees with the old proverb that ' a stitch in time saves nine,' and the Postmaster-General (Mr. Gibson), in pursuing the policy dictated by the Prime Minister and refraining from spending £333,000, is allowing certain public works to fall into disrepair. I have been in conversation with responsible officers who have said that if men were available certain postal works would be prevented from deteriorating. What does such a policy involve? When the finances of the country are in a buoyant position the work will be undertaken and the cost will be considerably greater than if it were carried out today. I cannot understand why the national parliament countenances such a thing. The honorable member for Darwin (Mr. Bell), who is usually a very reasonable man, interjected with some ferocity when I said that 100,000 men were out of work. He doubted the accuracy of the statement. . The latest industrial statistics show that although only one-half of the unions send in returns, there are 38,600 unionists out of work. If that number is multiplied by two we get approximately 80,000 unionists who are unemployed, and it is only reasonable to assume that 100,000 persons - unionists and non-unionists - are workless. The Trades Hall Council in Victoria, to which reference has been made by the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster) and others, sends out a form known as an unemployment return which contains the following: - That form is signed by the secretary of the Trades Hall Council, and on the 21st November, 1927, a return was received by the secretary, Mr. E. J. Holloway, giving the number of unemployed unionists who had registered as follows : - It is safe, to assert that these figures have been largely increased since November of last year. Returns were received from only 25 of the 100 unions associated with the Trades Hall Council in Victoria. The secretary of the Trades Hall Council in obtaining authentic figures, received information from only a percentage of the unionists associated with the Trades Hall in Melbourne. It would not have surprised me if the Prime Minister, as leader of the Nationalist Government in Australia and acquainted with the actual conditions prevailing had, on the re-assembling of Parliament informed the members of all parties that as unemployment was so prevalent and there was so much human suffering, it would be wise for Parliament to authorize certain public works to give relief. One would have expected such an announcement from the right honorable gentleman; but he took refuge behind the States and certain organizations whose duty he said it was to provide work. He also said that the unemployment was of a temporary nature, due largely to the climatic conditions. Some honorable members know what it is like to be out of work. Some on this side of the chamber have had the experience of going home to their wife and children without any wages and have experienced the hardships and sufferings associated with unemployment. A correspondent of the Labour Daily visited Newcastle the other day and referred to what is happening there in this way -"
"That is no exaggeration. I could also quote from the Melbourne Age a letter from a minister of religion in the electorate represented by the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) in which he makes an earnest appeal to the residents of Richmond to respond to the call for relief. Women and little children are suffering and he is earnestly pleading for help. The Mayor of Brunswick has also made a similar appeal for the thousands who are out of work in that district. I ask honorable members, irrespective of their political creed, to treat this subject in a humanitarian spirit. Why should we say that it is the duty of the State to provide employment? Surely we should not allow this distress to continue. The Prime Minister had the audacity to say that certain statements made by the Leader of the Opposition would do an injury to Australia. The greatest possible injury will be done to Australia if it comes to the knowledge of the people overseas that in this new country where there is so little done and so much to do there are 100,000 people out of work. If there is any country in the world which should have a progressive developmental policy and should incur expenditure on public works, it is Australia. I am not one of those who compare Australia with the older countries of the world where most of the principal developmental work has been done. In Australia we have only scratched the surface and much remains for us to do. The Postmaster-General, in a weak-kneed way, allowed the Prime Minister to reduce expenditure in his department which, I believe, is paying well. Even if it were not showing a credit balance it would not trouble me in the least, because it is a government instrumentality which is assisting to develop the country. It is idle for honorable members to say that this motion has been submitted as election propaganda- I hurl the statement back in the teeth of those who made it - when the representatives of churches in the cities and the presidents of shires in the country are united for the purpose of succoring those in, distress. Is it suggested that the Lord Mayor of Melbourne would convene a meeting at the Town Hall in Melbourne at which representatives of many important organizations were present to discuss the best means of affording relief if the distress was not acute? ' This Parliament has protected' those engaged in the. dried and canned fruit industries, as well as the growers of Doradilla grapes. Some States have provided farmers with seed wheat, and in Victoria, in districts where the thrip pest has been prevalent, fruit-growers have been given work in road making. In the Victorian mallee the State Labour Government is providing chaff at a cost of £10,000 to feed working horses. Assistance has also been readily given by this Parliament to those engaged in the butter industry. If on other occasions we have been prepared to spend money to give relief to sections of the community, surely this Parliament would readily authorize the spending of money to provide employment for' those who, at the moment, are workless. This is a fair and a legitimate demand. It is one to which the heart of every true Australian should respond. Members of the Labour party have never lagged behind in matters of this kind. We have always been to the forefront in granting assistance to any section 'of the community in need of it. It is natural, therefore, that we should now be voicing this demand for some measure of relief for 100,000 people who cannot find employment.  But I must return to the remarks of the Prime Minister. I should have liked this debate to be conducted in such a way as to leave no cause of complaint on either side, because this is the most important topic that could be discussed by honorable members. Let us consider the feelings of men who are out of work. Let us endeavour also to realize the anxiety which continued unemployment means to their wives and families. How could the Prime Minister airily brush aside such considerations? Yet that is what he did. It was almost criminal on his part to quote what may be regarded as ' cooked ' statistics concerning unemployment when the welfare of so many people- is at stake. Whatever confidence I had in him was dissipated as I listened to his tergiversation and duplicity. I do not wish to describe the honorable gentleman as he has been described by certain of his critics. He is a man in authority, and, like the Centurion of old, it is within his power to say to .this man ' Go, and he goeth,' and to another 'Do this, and he doeth it.' The right honorable gentleman has at his command the services of trained officials, and I have no doubt that he has in his office, collated for him by officers and publicity agents, material enough to deliver 20 or 30 different speeches on as many different topics. Notwithstanding his advantage in this respect he did not, as one might have expected, reply immediately to the motion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton). Instead he secured the adjournment of the debate so as to come fully armed the following day to deliver his reply. If the right honorable gentleman had spoken immediately after the Leader of the Opposition had resumed his seat, one might have excused him if certain inaccuracies were disclosed in his speech. But having taken a day within which to himself furnish with the latest statistics concerning unemployment' it was inexcusable that he should state the number of unemployed in Australia ' at 8,000 below the figures contained in the latest official returns. Why should any member of this House resort to trickery of that sort when discussing such an important issue? The Prime Minister well merits all the hard things that have been said about him."
"Some people may regard his speech as ingenuous and perhaps clever. In my opinion he was guilty of political trickery, and is deserving of the strongest censure. If we were a parliament of jokers, an assembly of light-hearted men engaged in the discussion of a matter that did not touch so vitally the life and interests of the people, there might have been some excuse for the levity of the right honorable gentleman; but in the circumstances his action was unforgivable. It is a matter for deep regret that in recent times he has not often drawn from the well of truth.  Turning now to the migration policy of the Government, I direct attention to the manner in which New Zealand is dealing with this problem. In the Dominion, the Government led by Mr. Coates is of the same political colour as that led by Mr. Bruce in Australia, though its ideals may not be identical. Like Australia, New Zealand is in an unsatisfactory economic position; but unlike Australia, it is taking steps to meet the situation by restricting migration. In the annual report of the New Zealand Department of Migration there appears the following paragraph: -"
"That is so, and unfortunately some unscrupulous employers take advantage of the plight of these foreign migrants. Many of them, according to consular reports, have to work for their ' keep.' The Government is to be condemned for the ineffective protection afforded to Australian industries by the existing tariff schedule. We have practically an unlimited supply of the raw materials for many industries. If we utilized our raw materials for the metal and textile industries, there should not be a single person unemployed in Australia who was willing to work. In those two industries alone, we should be able to provide employment for all our own people and a considerable number from abroad. The Prime Minister in his speech the other day gave one the impression that he was addressing shareholders of an importing firm. He declared that the Government intended to protect Australian industries. Unfortunately, while we are waiting for that protection our people are suffering through unemployment. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) yesterday had something to say about a number of industries which he assured us were to be established in Australia as a result of the. tariff protection afforded by this Government. I agree with the Minister as to the wisdom of British manufacturers establishing branch houses in the Commonwealth so that Australian requirements may be met by manufacturing concerns within the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, many overseas visitors who come to Australia on industrial missions have a hazy idea as to what Australia should or should not do in the way of manufacturing. Lately, Mr. W. R. Morris, the well-known British motor manufacturer, has been giving us the benefit of his views. I can assure him that, if he cannot wholly manufacture cars in Australia, he will find that American competitors will do so and oust him from the Australian market. Not long ago, in my electorate I had an interview with Sir Henry Cowan who, as honorable members are aware, has been a member of the British House of Commons for twenty years, and has been associated with business concerns in Australia for 40 years. As Ave were parting I gave him a final message, telling him to advise British manufacturers that if they wished to secure the Australian trade they must be prepared to establish themselves in Australia, otherwise Australian requirements would be met by manufacturing concerns backed with American capital. Henry Ford has established works in Australia, and he is the forerunner of others who are now making inquiries here. Sir Henry Cowan informed me that he agreed with my view, and that he would do all in his power to impress upon his brother manufacturers in Great Britain the need to establish works in Australia. The Minister for Trade and Customs only yesterday said that before long huge railway engines would be built by our' engineering works in New South Wales. Why, he is behind the times! South Australia is to be congratulated upon importing the Pacific and Mountain types of locomotives, although I would prefer it to obtain models from America and to build its engines in its own works."
"I am glad to hear that. For some months- Victoria hai had copies of plans and specifications of those engines, and a locomotive of the Pacific type built at the Newport workshops hy Australian workmen, is now undergoing its trials, and very soon will be hauling the Sydney express from Melbourne to Benalla.  The following letter from the secretary of the Federated Coopers of Australia was handed to me by the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) : -"
"Unemployment is such a poignant factor in both individual and national tragedy, and it means such irrecoverable waste of forces and materials both of production and civilization that this House would be justified, even had it not the specific power to deal with the causes of unemployment, to examine them at length. The discussion of the motion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton), has led to the statement of what the Labour party considers to be some of the causes of unemployment. I shall examine the case so presented and show conclusively, that what are alleged to he causes have nothing at all to do with unemployment. The motion deals with unrestrained migration, the curtailment of public expenditure, and the Governments alleged failure to assist industry. These are not real but bogus charges, brought \vp at this time for electioneering purposes. The policy of the present Administration, since it was constituted some five. years ago, has been to aim at the maximum amount of employment for the people of Australia, under conditions which will -not merely give them decent standards of living but also attract migrants of the best class to this country, and thus enable us to work out our own destiny. In my opinion, one of the most potent causes of the present unemployment is the tyranny exercised by the extremist leaders of the labour unions, who dictate to the unions a policy that, although consistently denounced at first by the same political leaders of Labour in both State and Federal spheres, has in the end been adopted because of the cowardice of some and the folly of other politicians. As a result of the operation of this extremist policy, and the political leaders acquiescence in it, ruin is facing many thousands in Australia to-day.  After the war industrial problems arose in practically every country in the world, but they have generally been solved by the co-operation of labour and capital, by an improvement in technique, and particularly by a stimulation of the morale of the workers in order to secure increased production which means an increased wages fund, and further employment. In Australia, however, the extremists have defeated every effort made by the Government to secure industrial peace and cooperation, and in so doing have exercised a tyranny which is almost unspeakable, and is reminiscent of the worst days of persecution in the history of the world. Not only have these extremists exerted pressure upon the political leaders of labour, but they have punished even honorable members in this House for holding to their opinions, and have crucified them for their convictions and their refusal to immediately bow the knee and accept other doctrines. Let me give four instances of such conduct within the last two or three years. In 1926 the industrial referendum was taken. It will be remembered that the leaders of the Labour party in this House said that although the proposals then submitted were not all that they desired, they were a considerable step in the right direction. They voted for the Governments proposals in this House, and said they would support them in the country. It is to the honour of the Leader of the Opposition and of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that they did this. But although the proposals had been endorsed in great part by the Labour movement, and had been a part  of its platform . for years, the extreme industrialists disregarded that endorsement, and conducted a vigorous propaganda which led to the defeat of the referendum. The members of the Labour party who stuck to their convictions were threatened with expulsion from the Labour movement and prevented from speaking publicly. That is a condition of things such as prevailed in the dark ages, when men were burned at the stake for their opinions. No one would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition and his supporters have ever been guilty of treachery to the principles of the Labour movement, yet for their stand on the referendum they were threatened with expulsion by the extremists leaders. Many Labour men at that time, not having the courage to stick to their convictions, weakly bowed the knee to the extremists, and assisted them to defeat the Governments proposals. Then there was the industrial mission to America. The appointment of that commission was recognized throughout Australia as a wise step, and the Governments proposals received support from the Trades and Labour Councils. In fact the councils nominated several of their members, including Mr. Jock Garden, to the commission. Because the Government refused to accept those nominations, and accepted instead those submitted by other unionists of Australia, the labour members of the Industrial Mission when they returned to Australia were persecuted by the extremists. One man in Adelaide was hounded from his job simply because he had had the courage to join the mission and to go to America to try to do something for his country. Another member, Miss May Matthews, who had been a labour worker for twenty years, has been denied the right to stand for pre-selection, and therefore cannot be a labour candidate at the next elections. She is being penalized for having had the courage to go to America, and by her observations there, to try to bring back information leading to the betterment of industrial conditions and the establishment of industrial peace in Australia. A similar position has arisen in connexion with the industrial peace conference which the Prime Minister proposes to convene in the near future. It remains for the future to show whether the cowardice that has characterized the so-called representatives of Labour hitherto will continue, or whether they will get courage to say that the movement towards the co-operation of capital and labour should be supported, so that production may he increased, the wages fund augmented and employment made plentiful. Let us take another illustration of the manner in which extremists dominate the Labour party, to the injury of the workers. Some time ago the Arbitration Court said definitely that it would grant a working week of 44 hours in particular industries, if certain conditions were observed, so as to ensure that production would be maintained at the existing level. The court pointed out that in its opinion that result could be brought about only by the adoption of piece work. What is the attitude of the extreme men in the industrial movement towards that system? It is shown by the recent statement of Mr. Chapman, secretary of the Railways Union of New South Wales. The court was appointed to give justice to both sides in industry, and admittedly it impartially considers the cases brought before it. Yet Mr. Chapman has said -"
"As the result of absorbing 982,000 immigrants between 1900 and 1910, and as the result also of the inflow of capital that occurred during the same period, Canada was able to convert a tremendous adverse trade balance into a large favorable balance. It was able to double its production and increase its exports. The population of the dominion were not as faint-hearted as honorable members opposite, who, because there has been a partially adverse season, and a drought in some of the States, and the time payment system has been indulged in too freely, declare that the whole scheme of migration should go by the board. Have they no faith in the future of this country? The Government and its supporters, and the great bulk of the population, many of whom have themselves come from the Old Country, are not afraid of the future, and I shall give figures later to show that there is no occasion for fear. Honorable members opposite attribute the present labour trouble to -a curtailment of public works expenditure. That is a remarkable volte face; because during the Budget debate, honorable members charged me with the crime of having borrowed to such an extent that the public debt had been increased by £2,000,000, or by £6,000,000- there was a doubt as to the amount - during the last five years. This year, despite loan retrenchment, we are borrowing £7,875,000. Honorable members opposite now grumble and say that we should not curtial borrowing, but should keep public works in progress. They neglected to mention that although the Commonwealth has increased its indebtedness by. £9,000,000 in six years, the States have borrowed £200,000,000 in the same period. They omitted to say anything about the wonderful increase in reproductive assets in Australia, that Commonwealth loans have been spent which have enabled the country to carry on in a much more satisfactory way than would, otherwise have been possible. Last year the Opposition objected to public borrowing, and now they take exception to its curtailment. Although there has been a reduction of loan expenditure, at the instance of the Loan Council, £46,000,000 of loan money is. to be spent this year by the States and the Commonwealth. Honorable members opposite say again that it was a terrible thing to reduce taxation last year by £1,750,000, because the money could have been used to provide employment in the carrying out of public works. This side of the House believe that the best place for surplus money is in the pockets of the people, so that it can be used for developmental enterprises, because in that way it is likely to be spent far more wisely and reproductively than if it were used for public works carried on under Government control for relief. Persons spending their own money take a personal interest in seeing that the best value is obtained for their outlay.' The curtailment of loan expenditure was decided upon after the most careful consideration, and retrenchment was permitted only in the case of works whose stoppage at the present time would not seriously interfere with their becoming ultimately reproductive. A similar course has been followed by the States.  Now I come to the Opposition's third charge, that the Government has consistently failed to assist industry. I have already said that our policy has invariably been to provide the maximum amount of employment for the people, and the figures prove conclusively that that result has been obtained. We have tried to stimulate production, we have increased the total wages fund of the Commonwealth, and we have added to the avenues of employment. Our policy has been definitely directed to ensure that the workers of Australia shall be able to compete successfully with the workers of other countries, because only by that means can we keep employment in Australia. We have reduced production costs in every possible way. For instance, we have reduced taxation, and we have attempted to improve transport facilities by means of our road policy. We have commenced to put into operation our policy of unification of railway gauges, in order to keep down the cost of transport. ' We have fostered scientific research to reduce the loss caused by pests. We have adopted better marketing methods to ensure improved prices for goods sent overseas, thereby increasing the wages fund in Australia. We have secured the orderly marketing of our produce overseas, and we have endeavoured to enlarge our markets by means of imperial preference. All these things have had a direct effect upon the value of our products, and will prove of benefit to Australia generally. We have aimed at increasing our output in every possible way by securing a maximum degree of standardization in connexion with industry, especially secondary industry. We have tried to promote industrial peace by encouraging goodwill between' employers and employed, in order to get the best results from the labour of the workers, which is the only way to improve the conditions of living. We have given marked assistance, as the Minister for Trade and Customs 'has shown, to both primary and secondary industries. He gave a list of the primary industries that have been stimulated by the tariff - butter, maize, fruit - dried and canned - cheese, hops, wine, sugar, timber and cotton, are but a few. The production of wheat and wool has been stimulated by the reductions in direct taxation that have been made in the last five years, and by the removal of taxation anomalies. We have attempted to develop secondary industries as far as possible, and have also tried to secure their development in a manner that will ensure that men with the greatest technical skill shall be' encouraged to come to Australia. I think that the facts adduced by the Minister show beyond doubt that we have been successful in thai direction in no slight degree. The Government has recognized that there are four big items in life - agriculture, mining, industry, and transport - which must be encouraged. Ministers have assisted primary producers to produce the raw materials required and the necessaries of life, and have stimulated secondary industries to increase the population at the quickest rate and making it possible to obtain the highest available value for the goods that are manufactured. But what has been the policy of the Labour party, both Federal and State? It has been in the direction of killing those industries which so vitally affect the welfare of the nation. Take agriculture, for example. Yesterday in Queensland a rural workers' award became operative, under which in either dry or wet weather, during harvesting operations or at any other time, the employees may not work more than 44 hours a week. Every one is aware that it is absolutely impossible to carry on agriculture under such conditions. Account must be taken of the weather conditions, or one is hopelessly left. Farmers of all shades of political opinion in Queensland are united in holding the view that the award will crucify their industry and confine their operations to areas which they are able to cultivate unaided by outside labour. The Labour party has always been careless in its attitude towards the interests of agriculture. If the arbitration law had been applied to that industry 30 years ago, when secondary industries were brought within its scope, it would have ceased to exist and Australia would have been ruined. Almost every increase in wages and the improvement in the living conditions of the men who are engaged in secondary industries has had to be borne by the primary producer and made possible by his labour. Let us now consider the mining industry. It is well known that the Mount Morgan mine, which turned out some of the finest engineers the world has produced, and would have had a considerably longer life if properly looked after, was killed by the conditions that were imposed by the government in which the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore) was Premier. A similar state of affairs exists throughout the mining industry as a whole, because the Labour party has been recklessly unmindful of the effects of its policy. It is killing the goose that lays the golden egg. I wish to place on record the attitude cf both industrial and official labour towards industry generally. It has the wild idea that if output is restricted unemployment is reduced. That policy is preached and practised all over the Commonwealth. The standard rate of wages must be paid by all industries irrespective of the amount of work that is done. It frowns on the piece-work system. The result of the operation of this policy is that the margin, between the wage paid to (he skilled and unskilled worker has progressively declined, the effect being that between 1910 and 1920, the number of unskilled workers in the Commonwealth increased at a rate four times as- great as the growth of the population, while skilled workers maintained the same rate of increase, and primary producers become proportionately fewer in number. Thus, Australia is gradually becoming the wage slave of other countries. If we continue to produce only unskilled workmen and goods that require only the employment of unskilled labour, it will be impossible to maintain our present standard or to carry on any big industry in competition with the rest of the world. That is the direction in which the policy of the Labour party has been steadily leading us during the last 30 years. But the decline has been much more rapid in the last five or six years, since the extremists obtained control of the movement and jettisoned those who desired to promote the welfare of Australian industry along sane and sound lines. Others were coerced into acquiescing in, and accepting, what they formerly denounced. Thus they were guilty of treachery towards those whom they are supposed to lead. This fact is becoming generally recognized by every person in the community, including the workers. The other day, in Queensland, a gentleman who claimed to be the leader of the unemployed throughout Australia pointed out that the policy of the unions and the Labour party generally, was gradually bringing about a condition of ' high wages for a few and many men out of work and no wages at all.' He said a policy which permitted more pay for less work was no good to Australia, and that we had to exhibit a willingness to do more work for those higher wages. I believe in the payment of the highest wages possible; but the amount of work done must be increased commensurately. I can prove from hundreds of documents that that is not merely my own opinion. At one time the honorable member for Dalley held very strongly the view, 'If you do not do the work you cannot get the money. ' The present Premier of Queensland has, during the last few months, shown courage by telling the workers frankly that neither in Australia nor anywhere else can a 48-hour week standard be obtained by working only 44 hours. The other day Chief Judge Dethridge put the matter plainly in the Arbitration Court when he said -"
"I am endeavouring to point out that if the political and industrial leaders of the Labour party viewed matters sanely, such disastrous happenings would be obviated.  During the last five or six years France has successfully concentrated its attention upon improving its industrial production. Although in its effort it has electrified its system of transport and power production, which necessarily means a saving in the use of coal, the consumption of coal in France increased from 45,000,000 tons in 1919 to 60,000,000 tons in 1924. The cooperation existing amongst all parties has resulted in increased production and a consequent increase in the number of industries operating. In 1923, 38,000,000 tons of coal were consumed in Canada, despite- the fact that for the preceding five years the average yearly consumption was only 32,000,000 tons, and that, during that period hydro-electric schemes were inaugurated which effected a saving of practically 29,000,000 tons per annum. That indicates that the consumption of coal in Canada has practically been doubled. This, again, has been due to cooperation among all parties, and the determination to get the utmost out of industry. In Australia the object appears to be continually to engender quarrels between employee and employer. In Queensland, where the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore) was for some years at the head of the Government, the State railways show an annual deficit of something like £2,000,000, which is reflected in the taxation, railway freights, and price levels of that State. Our overseas shipping has been strangled as a result of these continual industrial quarrels. Last year not merely our own ships, but oversea ships belonging to Great Britain, were held up by industrial extremists, without incurring very much rebuke from the officials of the Labour party. As a result, £1,000,000 worth of trade was diverted from British to foreign bottoms, and Great Britain, our best customer, was the loser. The people of Australia now demand to be told what is the intention of the Labour party in connexion with this industrial unrest. It is not the Federal Government, but the Australian Labour party that is arraigned on a motion such as this. What is the answer of that party? Throughout this debate honorable members opposite have continually harped on the financial policy of this Government, declaring it to be one of the contributory causes of the present trouble. I desire to dissociate myself entirely from the pessimism displayed by honorable members opposite, some of whom think that because there is a certain amount of financial stringency the country is going to the dogs, and will never recover. Our average production for the five years from 1921 to 1926 increased from £305,000,000 to £397,000,000. There has been very little change in price levels, and the increase in the total production during the same period was 25 per cent."
"I am replying to honorable members opposite. I am replying to those members who, when they were leaders, ran away from their responsibilities, and who now run away from their own statements when we seek to nail them down to them.  We come now to- the manner in which the Government has dealt with the finances of the Commonwealth. It has been suggested that because we have carried on in a certain way, unemployment has been brought about. The contrary is the case. We have found as a result of experience that the co-operation which the Commonwealth Government has been able to exercise with the States has resulted in reduced loan charges, and the formation of sinking funds in a reduction of the rate of interest. If the honorable member for Dalley will cast his- mind back to a transaction of his own, when he was Treasurer of Queensland, he will remember that the cost of raising a loan for the Queensland Government in America was £4 per cent. On the other hand, the charges on the last loan which we raised in America were only £2 10s. per cent., a clear saving of 30s. The important consideration in regard to borrowed money is the effect which it has on production. During the war the percentage of our interest charges to our total production mounted tremendously. Ever since then, however, the rate has been declining. Those percentages were as follows : - If we look at the matter from the point of view of the amount of interest on the debt provided by the various services on which the money was spent and the balance to be provided out of taxation we arrive at the following figures: - It will be seen, therefore, that our position is steadily growing better. That is because practically all the borrowing done by the present Government has been for reproductive work, such as the installation of telephones, which have returned not only interest but provision for sinking fund as well. The fact that we have borrowed this money has nothing to do with the present unemployment. It has tended to prevent unemployment, rather than to increase it. The last charge levelled against the Government is that we have created certain expensive commissions. Almost every speaker has said that we have done this at great and needless, cost to the country. The experience of other governments shows, however, that the appointment of commissions has something to recommend it. Take the case of New South Wales, where unprecedented losses in industry and great unemployment were brought about through the passing of hasty legislation. Last year Mr. Lang brought down his system of child endowment, without first having the system inquired into by a commission of experts. Speaking as a New South Welshman I know that that measure practically crippled the State commercially, and brought about a position of business panic and unemployment from which it has not yet recovered. The cost of all the commissions which have been appointed by the Federal Government during the last ten years does not amount to what New South Wales lost in one year, because of Mr. Lang's failure to remember the old adage, ' Look before you leap.' The honorable member for Dalley said that we should give the money to the States and allow them to develop their own land settlement schemes without interference from the Commonwealth Government. Even the Queensland State settlement schemes, however, have not been entirely successful. The Samson Vale settlement has disappeared from the face of the earth; and the Beerburrum settlement, so to speak, wishes it could disappear, because everybody there has failed. It is clear that if such 'schemes had been properly investigated in advance much money would have been saved to the people, and there would have been more money available to pay wages."
"Yes, and there is plenty of occasion for it. As a matter of fact, the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster) got on to the sob stuff before he finished his speech. His sob stuff was ' Why cannot we get together? Why cannot the worker let the boss tell him how kind he is in the process of crushing and bleeding him in preparation for further pressure and bleeding?' Yet that is exactly how the proposed peace conference would work out.  Honorable members of the Labour party have been twitted with not believing in the Arbitration Court. I believe in arbitration but only so far as it will meet the circumstances. I do not believe in the present system except as a palliation of present conditions. When the court talks of giving a little of the profit made by the industry to the man who does the work, I shall believe in arbitration, because it will be getting somewhere definite; but it never talks of giving to the working man any of the profit derived from his industry. It strips him naked in the court. I remember the brushmaker's case in Adelaide many years ago. Women went into the witness-box before Mr. Justice Gordon, and told him how much they spent in groceries, meat, and clothing, and on dad's tobacco and lodge money; their domestic arrangements were literally stripped naked to disclose how they spent the few pounds their husbands earned. After the evidence was given the President of the Industrial Court, knowing full well that nothing could be paid to the workers in the industry unless there was a profit attaching to their work, fixed what he described as the ' irreducible minimum' on which a man, his wife, and three children could live. He added the following addendum, ' I find that it costs just as much to keep a man up in the Stockade as is paid to workmen in an industry in South Australia.' That is the basis of arbitration as we know it to-day; but if labour has got a little more out of it than was got at that period of which I speak, the credit lies with the men whom the honorable member for Wakefield describes as agitators. The honorable member is a nice one to talk about agitators. When he talks he goes absolutely mad. If he were in the midst of a mob of hungry men and talked as flamboyantly as he did this morning, he could not disclaim responsibility for any ebulition or inopportune happening that might be brought about. For him to talk about agitators is for the pot to call the kettle black. There is no greater agitator in manner or language than the honorable member when he is addressing the House. If necessary I could quote statistics to show what a calumniator he was in his attack upon the honorable member for Grey (Mr. Lacey). But I have no desire to quote figures. Nor have I any desire to go through a long, rambling resume of the actions of the Government that have brought about the present unemployment. I want Ministers to try to do something to pull the Commonwealth out of the slough into which it has got. Honorable members of the Opposition have been accused of promoting this debate for the purposes of political propaganda, but it would be a disgrace to civilization if we could not come to a national parliament and call attention to a set of circumstances that has come under our notice. In South Australia I did not identify myself With the unemployed until a week or two ago, but when I saw. a- gathering of 2,000 unemployed, all of them healthy, strong men, willing and ready to work, I could not help associating myself with them. I had nothing to offer them from a Commonwealth point of view. I could only tell them that Commonwealth works were being curtailed because of the financial position. We have the word of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that the existing financial system will not allow the Commonwealth to absorb these unemployed workmen on Commonwealth works. I say now what I said to those unemployed, ' To-day you are useless and scrapped, and the Commonwealth cannot feed you. But if war broke out to-morrow, nine-tenths of you would be described as fit to serve. You would be sent white feathers urging you to join up.' The Treasurer said that if money were borrowed in Australia instead of overseas the commercial equilibrium of the Commonwealth would be disturbed. On the 15th July, 1915, 'Willie' Watt made the same statement in regard to a £5,000,000 loan. Since that time, Australia has borrowed over £300,000,000 within its own shores. Now we are told that the country would collapse like a pricked bubble if £20,000,000 were raised in the local market. Loan transactions during the war period showed how little the right honorable member for Balaclava knew of the power to expand credit. I do not say that the cash which the Government requires is available in Australia, but the currency needed to meet the necessities of the moment can be provided if the Government so desires. But of course, the god of profit must be served. Anybody who has money to lend must have his 5 or 5£ per cent. At the beginning of the Great War the interest rate on Commonwealth loans was 4 per cent. Mr. Fleming, who then represented Robertson, said they were gilt-edged securities, and he urged people to put their money into them. In subsequent flotations, the rate increased gradually till it reached 6 per cent. The patriots who sooled on other men to fight for them and were not game to enlist and enter the wet trenches and eat tin dog, would not allow even their money to serve the country unless they got a substantial profit from it. Nine-tenths of the men who are out of work to-day have worked themselves out of their jobs. Statistics prove that the productivity of labour was never greater than it is to-day. That is true of the garnering of wheat, the curing of hams, the clipping of wool, and the making of boots, hats, tin pannikins, and everything else. Sir Robert Home said a few days ago that there is no finer type of man in the world than the Australian, but thousands of our men have worked themselves out of their jobs, and the little Australians opposite, having skimmed all the cream off the milk, would allow the real producers of wealth to starve. They would treat the workers worse than the cattle and machinery on their farms; they say it is not their responsibility to find employment for the men who need it. If they have no such responsibility, why do they endorse a financial agreement which will enable the Commonwealth to control the finances of the States? This Government ha3 deprived the States of the per capita payments, and having claimed the right to call the tune to which the States must dance, expects to be immune from the results that follow. If any trouble comes from organized labour through the economic circumstances existing to-day, the blame will attach to this and other Parliaments which have not done their duty, which, we are told, is to govern and not to trade. The Treasurer stated that the interest payments overseas amount to about £25,000,000, which is approximately the amount which is being borrowed abroad. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjected that the Prime Minister did not deny that his Government was borrowing to pay the interest bill. Then the Treasurer speciously explained that it was better to pay the interest due abroad with money raised there than to bring borrowed money from overseas and send it abroad again, thus paying double exchange. That is a fact of elementary finance, is known to the veriest tyro, but the statement that we borrow money to pay interest abroad remains uncontroverted."
"So that the employers might evade payment for the holidays. They are the most cunning crowd in Christendom. On one occasion I interested myself in an analysis of the various laws on the statute-book. I found laws directed against burglary, obscene language, theft, assault, and many other offences against the community. These enactments were applicable to all sections of the community, but the vast majority of the laws on the statute-book were designed to keep the commercial community honest. There are laws relating to companies, land agents, doctors, dentists, and dozens of other persons engaged in commerce or the professions; but, except for the Arbitration Act, no law has been necessary to keep the working man up to the collar. In South Australia even the Factories Department will not chase up an employer who has broken the law. Although a man wearing a horse-hair wig may sit in a court to fix the wages and hours of labour, the employers can sack 30,000 men for a week in order to escape payment for holidays.  The Treasurer's principal argument was that the Labour leaders in this Parliament are controlled by the 'Reds,' and have not the courage to stand by their convictions. To illustrate his point, he asserted that when we desired to advocate an affirmative vote in respect of the referendum proposals submitted to the people at the last election, we were obliged to obey the dictates of industrialists connected with another branch of the movement. Mr. Grayndler, the general secretary of the Australian Workers' Union, is credited with having fired the first shot in the anti-referendum campaign, but as soon as he did so he left for Java on a holiday. We have been told that because the ' Reds ' asserted their disapproval of the Government proposals to enlarge the industrial powers of the Commonwealth on the ground that industrial conscription would result, we were forced to advocate disagreement with them; but the very man whom the Treasurer declares was the principal ' Red ' to whom we have to bow the knee, was selected by the Prime Minister as an appropriate representative of organized labour to accompany the industrial delegation to America. The fact of the matter is that the Treasurer, like his colleagues on the other side of the House, is prepared to state his arguments in any way that will meet what he conceives to be the requirements of the moment, without having any regard for the facts. 'We have been advised to urge that labour representatives should be allowed to participate in the coming peace conference. But such a conference will not get us anywhere if the Government persists in its intention to allow representation to bodies other than recognized labour organizations. In our opinion it is essential that the industrialists should be permitted to choose their own representatives to' the conference. For my own part I should be quite willing for bona fide labour organizations to be represented at the conference, for no harm can come to them from hearing what their opponents have to say. The suggestions at the conference are not likely to amount to any thing more than a general adoption of the principle of the survival of the fittest. Such a doctrine will never be acceptable to us. The Labour movement has not grown to its present state -in five minutes. It passed through much travail before it became sufficiently powerful to compel- the various Governments to pass legislation to regulate the hours of labour and working conditions. Our opponents frequently twit us by saying that organized labour has done nothing to improve the lot of the workers; but looking back over my short life, and thinking of the experience through which I passed - I began life as a factory lad, then became a commercial traveller, and ultimately found myself a member of this Parliament - I can see a marked improvement in the standard of living of the common people. Years ago women and children were obliged to work long hours in factory and field for a mere pittance; but to-day the hard work of the nation is done principally by its men. We have very little child labour now, and the ruling wages in those industries in which women are employed are infinitely higher than those of the bad old days. Let us assume for a moment that the peace conference is held and that an agreement is reached which will have the effect of establishing as a principle in Australia, payment by results. Let us assume also that the workers agree to accept lower wages and work longer hours than at present. Will that solve our unemployment problem? It will not. The solution of our problem will not be found in increased production. As the honorable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) pointed out the other night, our storehouses are already full to overflowing and the return for our wool clip is quite as satisfactory this year as it has been in recent years. It is not more production that we need, but a more .even distribution of the wealth that is produced. If we persist in our present methods and produce more, it will simply mean that the few will be wealthier and the many poorer. We shall have m'ore unemployment than there is at present. What is necessary to enable us to remedy our trouble is a complete change in our economic system. . The first thing suggested is to dispense with interest on capital. I have taken out the figures in connexion with the New South Wales railways, and find that they are not earning interest on the capital invested in them. I am also conversant with the position in South Australia. Before our railways can earn a penny they have to pay an exorbitant amount of interest to the overseas or local money-lenders. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) spoke of paying £25,000,000 overseas, and apparently it will be a perpetual borrowing business to meet interest on loans. But the £1,000,000,000 which Australia owes, capitalized at 5 -per cent., means £1,000,000 a week, which we have to earn before we can pay wages or obtain the ordinary necessaries of life. It is astounding to realize that from the fruits of our labour we have to pay away £1,000,000 weekly in interest. This must be changed, and there will be no industrial peace in Australia until we produce for use and not for profit. It is the duty of the Government to find employment for those who are out of work. At a meeting of the unemployed in Adelaide which I addressed, I suggested that it would be advisable for the men to parade through the main streets, so that the people would realize the seriousness of the situation. I told them that I was prepared to lead them, and, although I was told that they had marched without effect on previous occasions, I persuaded them to form a procession and march through the streets so that those who in the ordinary course of affairs were not brought into close association with the distress in their midst would realize the gravity of the situation. I led those men through the streets, and, for the information of the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster), I should like to relate the attitude adopted by ' Von ' Homburg in that city. The party with which the honorable member is associated would not, during the war, trust that gentleman, who prior to the outbreak of hostilities represented the district of Murray. He was defeated, I think, on two occasions, but subsequently he was again taken to the bosoms of those who had previously supported him. He is now the Attorney-General of South Australia. It is amazing to live and realize the hyprocisy preached at that time. The Attorney-General told me that I was simply leading the men up a hill and down again; but, curiously enough, the same morning he arranged for 130 telegrams to be despatched to the different district councils throughout South Australia, asking them if they could give relief to the unemployed."
"The interjection of the honorable member reminds me that the Government has been effectively criticized by all speakers from this side of the House. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) stated the case for the censure motion, and his remarks were endorsed by the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin). The statistics with regard to unemployment quoted by the Prime Minister and Government supporters have been proved to be inaccurate. If the figures relating to the adverse balance of trade were not ' cooked ' they were, at all events, handled very awkwardly.  As the position has been . fully stated by other honorable members on this side, no good purpose would be served by my covering the same ground. The honorable member for Gwydir (Mr. Abbott) had something to say about child endowment and national insurance, which, we have been assured, is the settled policy of the Government. Both national insurance and child endowment have been features of Labour policies for many years, and since they have now been adopted by the Government, it is obvious that the Labour party must always have been on sound lines. Had the proposals of the Government with regard to both those questions been given effect, the situation to-day might not have been so serious as it is. Nothing, however, has been done to deal with the present industrial depression. All members of this Parliament owe a duty to humanity. I could not help feeling, when the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster) was speaking, that the people who are suffering most are not receiving that consideration which they are entitled to expect. I am well acquainted with the career of the honorable member for Wakefield, and I am familiar with the tenets of his early political faith. I do not wish to hand out ' sob' stuff, as suggested by the honorable member for Gwydir, but I wish to secure justice for those who are suffering at the moment. It is the right of the unemployed to have the opportunity to work. The position in Adelaide is little short of desperate, and I question if the State Government can do much to relieve the situation there. The Leader of the Opposition in the State Parliament (Mr. Hill) made certain proposals recently, but the Premier of that State (Mr. Butler) denied that any of the suggestions could be given effect to. While there is this conflict of opinion between the two leaders, the position of the unemployed in that city has become extremely acute. The suggestion was made that the unemployed should take drastic action, even to the extent of breaking a few windows. I strongly objected to such tactics, and pointed out that the men's position would be worse than ever, because they would be gaoled by the police."
"Mr. Bruce said that it was the survey of the position in the dried fruits industry by the commission which brought matters to a' head. The commission reported that the condition of the world's market for dried fruit had reached saturation point, and that the plans made originally on the basis of extensive developments in this industry must go by the board.  Mr. Bruce said that the investigations of the commission had also shown that a similar parlous condition of over-production existed in the canned fruit industry throughout the world."
