"When asked what he made of Senator Joyce’s remarks and whether they were irresponsible, the representative of Citigroup said they were ‘absolutely’ irresponsible. That is where we have the statements by Senator Joyce and the response to them from the marketplace. It is not the first time Senator Joyce has opened his mouth on this. He has made similar remarks about the sovereign debts of the various states of Australia and the sovereign debt of the United States of America, the largest economy in the world, where he said that they were at risk of general default, resulting in turn in global ‘economic Armageddon’. What has happened in response to this? In this morning’s Age , we have the shadow Treasurer stepping up to the plate and saying boldly that in fact there is ‘no danger’ of Australia defaulting on its debt—thank you, Joe—and, on top of that:"
"So in the Age he says he fundamentally repudiates what Senator Joyce has to say on sovereign debt, and on the ABC this morning he says he has full confidence in the shadow minister and presumably that which he says. Is it any wonder we find it a bit hard to work it all out? But the final word on this must go to the Leader of the Opposition himself. The Leader of the Opposition, when asked whether he backs or does not back Senator Joyce, was all over the place this morning. Four times he was asked whether he would back Senator Joyce as shadow finance minister come the next election:"

"It took him two times. The wheels were turning in his head and he suddenly thought: ‘Whoops! I’d better actually say I have confidence in Senator Joyce.’ It had to be squeezed out of him. It was a painful process. It had to be squeezed out of him. I understand that watching this circus is entertaining and diverting for many people, but you can get a real sense of how a prospective government is going to govern and how it is going to behave in government by watching how it behaves in opposition. If this circus were occurring in government, there would be absolute mayhem. Investors would be spooked. Our No. 1 ally would be demanding an explanation for the finance minister of this country announcing it was about to default. Australian jobs would be threatened and we would have a bitterly divided government in a period of great global challenge. By appointing Senator Joyce as shadow finance minister, by allowing this circus of great division and disunity to continue, by indicating no interest whatsoever in economic issues, the Leader of the Opposition shows that he is a giant risk to the Australian economy and that he is not worthy of the trust of the Australian people to manage our economy and our finances."

"The member for Bowman then left the chamber. —This government is proud of its record of more than 200,000 computers in Australian secondary schools; proud of the fact that we have the biggest school modernisation program underway in Australia’s history; and proud of the fact that we are undertaking fundamental reforms in the quality of education through the My School website and the investment in disadvantaged schools. This is a record of achievement in education. When the Leader of the Opposition stands up and speaks about integrity of commitments, I have one set of words for him: rock solid, solid gold guarantee—the absolute ‘rock solid’, ‘ironclad’ commitment that he gave to the Australian people on his Medicare safety net undertaking. The Leader of the Opposition stands up and speaks of integrity, but ‘rock solid, ironclad, absolute commitment’ were his words on the eve of the 2004 election when he said he would not touch the Medicare safety net, would not touch the thresholds, and then four months later upped the thresholds both for low-income earners and for middle-income earners. Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he raises and continues to raise questions of integrity and commitment here, one by one we will go through what happened under his period as health minister, one by one we will go through his record in terms of the Medicare safety net—that rock solid, ironclad commitment that he gave to the Australian people—and, beyond that, we will look very carefully at what the Leader of the Opposition had to say as he sought to weasel his way out of the fact that he ripped $1 billion out of Australia’s public hospital system. The Leader of the Opposition was health minister for four years and what he came out and said was, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me; in fact, it is just that the increase in expenditure on health slowed a little bit.’ I can say to the Leader of the Opposition that we are going to peel back those numbers day by day and look at precisely what he did in the period 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007—the period when he was health minister—so proud he is of his achievements in this respect. We welcome a debate on the record of his achievement in health against the record of achievement of this government in health. We welcome a debate on the record of this government in education against the record of those opposite on education. Every time the Leader of the Opposition opens his mouth, ‘Absolute, rock solid ironclad commitments,’ we will be listening very carefully to the integrity of his words, as we watched with great disappointment the honouring of those commitments by him in the past."
"To what is he referring? Work Choices, of course—the great reform of the Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts on the front bench, who he has promoted to the front bench. ‘Of course,’ he says, ‘only the name Work Choices is dead’—you know, like the parrot: ‘It’s not dead; just pining for the fjords.’ Of course, Work Choices would come back under the Leader of the Opposition if he ever were to become Prime Minister. He went on to describe the spending on schools that everyone is fond of as ‘very low-grade spending’. Who is engaged in building these infrastructure projects that the opposition leader continues to oppose to this day? Of course, it is our tradies and the small businesses who supply them. The opposition voted against—and to this day continues to oppose—that spending and support for small business. We can conclude from that that the opposition leader, with his extreme views, is a big risk to Australia. I can illustrate that further because yesterday the opposition leader floated a policy of six months paid parental leave. When looking for the source of funding for this—and I believe he referred to the book on the Alan Jones program this morning—he referred back to his book where he developed this policy and said: ‘It could be funded through a small general levy on business. Small business would instinctively regard any extra cost from the levy as unfair.’ You bet your sweet bippy they would regard it as unfair. We are talking about sources of funding and integrity. When the shadow finance minister was asked on Lateline just last week how he would fund the coalition’s $10 billion climate change con job, he referred to the tax system and said, ‘That is the whole mechanism of where we get the money from.’ The whole mechanism is the tax system. That would be true to form. Why? Because the coalition holds the record as the biggest taxing government in Australia’s history, as confirmed by the budget papers. Small businesses would be in the firing line from either the levy or the taxes that Sir Barnaby Bjelke-Petersen has described as the source for this extra revenue to fund the parental leave scheme and also—"

"That is the shadow minister’s position. He is also on the record as respecting the climate science and the need for emissions trading as I have adverted to. It is almost enough to make one feel a bit for him. He is now surrounded by climate change sceptics, he is taking economic instructions from Senator Joyce and he is putting his name to an economically irresponsible and environmentally unworkable coalition policy. He is putting a brave face on it, as he did at the National Press Club today, but I tell you what—it is compromising him deeply. The coalition policy will not work. We already know that emissions will rise by up to 13 per cent over year 2000 levels under their plan. Their policy relies on costly subsidies for favoured projects. Yesterday I pointed to the analysis by Bloomberg that the abatement cost will be in the order of $64 per tonne. The Department of Climate Change analysis also suggests the carbon abatement cost per tonne will be in excess of $50. The Leader of the Opposition claimed it would be $15, I think, when launching the policy. It is completely uncosted and irresponsible economically, with a large burden on the economy. There is no obligation on large emitters of carbon pollution to reduce their emissions. Their proposal is going to put up prices. There is no compensation for pensioners and households. It is a totally economically and environmentally irresponsible position to adopt and it is already creating uncertainty for investment in the energy market because everyone knows a carbon price is coming and that it must be fixed by a market efficient method. The truth is that many on the other side still agree with the government’s position. It is to be remembered that only 10 weeks ago a majority of the coalition party room supported emissions trading and supported the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The fact of the matter is that they remain deeply divided over this issue. I noticed in parliament the other day, when the member for Wentworth was giving his address on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation, the member for North Sydney came in to offer support. You should have offered your support when it really counted, when the national interest was at stake, and not been seduced by the media and by the urgers in your own party to be the third man and come last in the race. The important thing is to support economically responsible policy, but all of you, if you oppose the CPRS when it goes to the vote tomorrow, will fail that test."
