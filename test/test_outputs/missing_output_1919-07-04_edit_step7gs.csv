"It is only too true that this state of affairs relates not to the home of one child only, but is characteristic of thousands of homes in Australia to-day.  The honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Mcwilliams) said last evening that several hundred soldiers had been prevented from returning to their homes in Tasmania because of the action of Mr. Walsh, general secretary of the Seamen's Union, in calling out the crew of the Wyandra. That statement illustrates the colossal hypocrisy of the Government, who are trying to persuade the people that the seamen are the cause of the present trouble. As a matter of fact, the Government are deliberately holding up the coal supply and trying to utilize the Seamen's Union, just as they availed themselves of the Eveleigh Workshops dispute in 1917, to starve the women and children of this country, and to blame the workers for the trouble, in order to break down our industrial organization. They wish to remove the political representatives of the working classes here. The country is being run at the present time by a gang of murdering thieves. It is a conspiracy-"
"Several honorable members interjecting,"
"Order! I took the somewhat unusual course of suspending the sitting in order to afford some honorable members sufficient time for calm reflection, in the hope that they would recognise the seriousness of the position that was developing. One of the duties imposed upon me, as the presiding officer of the House, is to see that the rules are. respected.  I must therefore ask the honorable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine), now that he has had ample time for reflection, to withdraw the words of which complaint was made at the time of the interruption of our proceedings."
"No, and many other men entitled to leave did not get it. When General Monash was brought down to Devonport, he approved of leave and it was given."
"I am not prepared to admit that he is the best friend of the soldiers, but he is a very good one. I do not, however, want to discuss Mr. Keith Murdoch. The point is that the arrangements made were that, during December, 14,000 men should he sent away. In mistake, I gave the figure just now as 12,000 men. There were to be 16,000 sent in January; 18,000 in February; and so on, increasing by 2,000 each month. Those arrangements were made in December. Mr. Keith Murdoch wrote his letter on 8th December; but the arrangements of the Demobilization Department with the Shipping Comptroller were upon the basis I have quoted. The Government have been charged that they deliberately blocked men from coming home. They did nothing of the sort.  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition quoted certain figures regarding the number of men despatched during December, January, and February. Those figures, I believe, are correct. They are certainly not up to the totals which I have just quoted, the reason being that the Imperial Government could not provide the ships. The Shipping Comptroller could not keep anywhere near to his original agreement with the Australian Military authorities. In regard to the figures which Mr. Higgs quoted, it must be kept in mind that in February there was a tremendous slump. The total went down to about 4,000 or 5,000 men. That was directly due to the great strike throughout the United Kingdom among the men responsible for refitting and finishing the fittings on troopships. It was not a question of a strike among waterside workers, as we know that body in Australia, or of a strike of seamen; it affected carpenters and artisans. The trouble was not settled in London and Southampton until some considerable time after matters had become normal in other ports. We felt the effect of the strike in February, mainly because the ships which had been allotted to the Australian troops by the Shipping Comptroller were in the Thames and at Southampton Docks. That fact explains the fall in the February returns. General Monash - as Mr. Murdoch cabled in the extract which I have just quoted - knowing that the Australians would include a very large number of unionists, and that they would not desire, unless circumstances were very grave, to attempt to take the places of the men on strike, simply put the whole case before the men themselves. I know, from personal contact with the situation, that he stated the position to the men who were to come home on one ship in particular, and that was the Euripides. He said, in effect, 'There is the ship at Tilbury Docks at the present moment. I cannot control the strike. I am not in any sense responsible for it. On the other hand, I cannot secure a vessel from the Shipping Comptroller to replace that ship. It is for you men now to say whether you will take the place of these who are not at work, and prepare the ship to be sent home with yourselves on board.' Thereupon a number of the Australian troops concerned undertook to fit that ship as well as others; and that is how the difficulty was overcome. Moreover, Mr. Keith Murdoch told the Australian people on the 28th February that that was so; and I can support what he wrote, because it was an absolute fact. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made another statement to the effect that strong pressure would secure ships."
"I beg the honorable member's pardon. I was under the impression that he had made it as his own statement. I only know this, that General Monash and his staff, and Mr. Hughes on every conceivable occasion, and Sir Joseph Cook at every opportunity, did their utmost to get shipping from the Comptroller. Honorable' members opposite, however, should place themselves in the shoes of the Comptroller. That official had not only the Australians to consider - he had to provide for the transport of food supplies to England. He knew that there was food to be got from the United States and Canada. He was compelled to bring the foodstuffs from the nearest points first, in, order to relieve the tension. British public opinion would never have stood for an official who would say, 'Let us put all the ships on the Australian run. Let us send all the Australian troops home in them. There is food to be got from Australia; but I will admit, that the ships will be away for six months, while, if I were to send vessels to Canada they would be there and back with foodstuffs within a month.' We should endeavour to realize, also, some of the difficulties which our representatives in the Old Country have been, and are, up against. It is not simply a case of putting up their hands and saying, 'We demand the ships.' Mr. Keith Murdoch knew that as well as I did. General Wisdom was appointed to take charge of transportation organization. I met him a few days before I left London, and I shall mention what was said at that meeting merely to indicate the attitude of responsible officials concerning demobilization. General Wisdom was in high glee. He said, 'I have just secured another ship which the Canadians had had on offer, but which they have not been able to use. I have persuaded the Shipping Comptroller to turn it over to the use of the Australians; and, although it means that we must prepare our draft and make ready all the necessary information after the men have been selected, and that we shall have only five days in which to do it, I have nevertheless agreed that we shall fill the ship and send her out.' That officer has been right through the mill, starting as a major and finishing as a brigadier. He knows the game. He knew what the Australian soldiers wanted. He was so keen over getting that extra ship that he showed his gratification in unmistakable manner. While honorable members in this House criticise the Government and hold them responsible, they must remember that the individual administrative duties in London are being performed by men who are as keen to get the Australian soldier back home as anybody out here in Australia."
"I do not agree that that was the case. Let us examine the various dates. On 8th December Mr. Murdoch wrote from the Old Country, and  January's figures showed an increase over those of December."
"Then why is Senator Pearce required there?"
"I did not see anything in it disrespectful to the British Government. The honorable member knows as well as I do that the gentlemen who compose the British Government are human just as he and I, and are liable to make the same sort of mistakes. After all, it is time after time necessary to get to the right man in order to 'make good.'  The honorable member for Capricornia referred to a speech made by Major Henley, who is member for Burwood in the New South Wales Parliament. No date was quoted as to when the ships in question were offered and refused, and I remind the honorable member that to offer a ship to the Australian authorities to-day, and say that it must be loaded on Sunday is not practicable. On this side of the world we desire every man to return with a full statement of his affairs as they have developed oversea. In giving this information, I am not using technical terms, but stating the facts as briefly as possible in a fashion that honorable members can accept and appreciate. We desire to have with each man a photograph of his pay ledger card in order that when he arrives here it may not be, as it was originally, a matter of weeks and months before he can be finalized. Profiting from mistakes in the past, the Department on the other side decided that after selecting a man for a quota or draft, they would get all the particulars and papers necessary, and send them on the ship on which the man travelled, so that he and they might arrive simultaneously. In about 1 per cent of the cases the plan fails even to-day, as the most carefully arranged mechanism and administration must fail. When this honorable member of the State Parliament of New South Wales makes the assertion he does, it would be as well to find out the date on which the ships were offered and rejected, and the period that was allowed in which they were to be filled with men. I do not know the circumstances at all, but-"
"The honorable member has no right to judge unless he knows.  He asked me a little while ago to prove something, and I do not wish to retaliate by asking him to prove his statement, because he does not know the facts."
"The honorable member for Kennedy (Mr. McDonald) by interjection asked when the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) would reply, and the Acting Prime Minister was good enough to refer to myself in connexion with demobilizaton matters."
"He called upon you to give your testimony."
"I cannot admit that. The administration at Horseferry-road was as good as could be found anywhere."
"The complaint here was that returned soldiers did not have the opportunity of getting those positions, and that men who had not seen a day's active service were chosen in preference to them."
"It is evidently a double-barrelled complaint, but I believe I am right in saying that quite a number of the men who went away from here - in fact, about half of them - have seen overseas service.  Sitting suspended from 1 till 2.15 p.m. While I commend the promptitude with which the Government dealt with the work of demobilization in London after the armistice had been signed, I do not think that the complexities of the undertaking were realized by Ministers here, nor did the Government in Australia, in my judgment, make the preparatory arrangements which ought to have been made before the armistice. The matter was brought under the notice of the Government in July and August of last year, but while the demobilization schemes of other countries, including some of the Dominions of the Empire, had been outlined and agreed upon by their respective Administrations, we in Australia were undecided. Various propositions were put to the Government, but were neither rejected nor accepted. Some little time might have been saved in organizing the Demobilization Department in London had proper attention been given to the original suggestion put forward from the Imperial end. I am glad that the Leader of the Government requested me to deal with the demobilization proposition. Before I left the Old Country, General Monash also asked me, not only to advise members of the Cabinet here as to what was taking place, but also to make it as widely known as possible, since he recognised that the work he was undertaking, which was not perfect in his eyes, needed some explanation, in order that the people, and particularly the members of this Parliament, might appreciate some of the difficulties associated with it. Turning to the repatriation proposals in the Ministerial statement, I say quite frankly that my brief experience in my constituency taught me that the work of repatriation bristled with difficulties. The Department entered upon it without any precedents for its guidance. Precedents had to be created from day to day and week to week, and at the outset the machinery governing . the repatriation effort was necessarily imperfect. There have been individual cases where the regulations framed under the Act have pressed harshly, and, in the view of some honorable members, rather unjustly, but my experience of the Department is that it is not only sympathetic in its treatment of the returned soldier, but does its utmost to meet the varying and conflicting requests that are put forward. We all know that what suits one individual may not suit another, and that a regulation framed to-day to meet, perhaps, quite a number of cases of a particular kind may be apt to press heavily on other individual cases. Taking the work of the Department all through, however, when we find that, after allowing for the men who have returned to their former avocations without assistance, only 4 per cent of those who have been dealt with by the Department have not been satisfactorily placed, we must agree that its performance is most creditable. I was surprised that the honorable member for Brisbane (Mr. Finlayson) should have attempted to throw on the Government the whole responsibility for the industrial unrest prevalent throughout Australia to-day, on the ground that they had not made it easier for various unions to approach the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Every honorable member of this House is familiar with the constitutional and other difficulties that have been in the way, so that the honorable member, in seeking to lay the whole of the blame at the door of the Government, was most unjust. He knew perfectly well that his statement was incorrect. The effect of the return to civil employment of the men who have been fighting is not being felt in Australia only. The matter is one that affects the whole world, and industrial unrest to-day is world-wide. In to-day's newspapers there appears a cablegram reporting a speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), in which he clearly indicates that industrial unrest in the Old Country is a very pressing question, and reminds both Capital and Labour that in order to satisfactorily settle it, the greatest care must be exercised in the reabsorption of our tens of thousands of soldiers into civil employment. I believe that in this process a good deal of friction is inevitable, since it means the displacing of a great number of women workers and of others who necessarily filled the gap during the absence of our men at the front. That friction, however, is not going to be removed by the making of inflammatory speeches. Every honorable member should realize the responsibilities resting upon him, and if we are to assist in bringing about a better understanding between employer and employee, we should get to grips with the problem before the nation."
"The causes of industrial unrest are clearly associated not only with the industries and the technicalities relating thereto, but with the wider social, domestic, or national questions affecting the homes and domestic concerns of the people."
"I do not agree with that at all. It is not a question of 'getting the wind up' in their case. I remind the honorable member that the Government of the United Kingdom offered a shipyard as a going concern to different federations of the steel and iron trade, with permission to step into it, and pay for it on the very lengthiest of terms, or to run it for a given number of years to see what sort of a fist they made of it. There is no question of the British Government 'having the wind up' is there? Unfortunately, the workers' organizations, for some reason or other, turned the proposition down, according to cabled reports. Again, in West Hartlepool, a private employer offered his employees in a shipbuilding concern equal representation on the directorate, and, after the payment of their own and other salaries and working costs, an equal share in the profits. Sir Robert Hadfield in 'the Birmingham district did exactly the same thing. It is up to us on both sides of the House to do our part as responsible public men in introducing the idea of the alliance into our general commercial life, in order that, on the one hand, the man who does not believe that any good can come from labour may be converted, and, on the other, that the man who, as a representative of organized labour, thinks no good can come from the employer may be converted also, and that we may have a better tone, a more humane understanding, and a new spirit in the community, to use the phrase which honorable members opposite cheered just now. Industrial unrest is not confined to Australia. It is not the sin of this Government, nor would it be the sin of the Opposition if they were in power. The simple fact is that the whole world is feeling the strain, and unrest is showing itself everywhere."
"I invite the honorable member to bring his cases along, when he speaks, as I am doing now. I am quite willing to learn. During the last six weeks I have had opportunities of seeing the balance-sheet of more than one concern which was openly accused in my own State of becoming rich and fat at the expense of the community. I am not a chartered accountant, but I hope I have enough brains and common sense to understand a balance-sheet when it is put in front of me, and I say distinctly that, although those charges were levelled promiscuously against these firms, their balance-sheets, which were shown to me in confidence, showed nothing in the way of huge profits accounted for either by salaries, by provision for future expansion, by development, or in stock."
"We must press these questions again, because they are of urgent importance. Any honorable member who chooses to inquire into the matter will find that in regard to all importations into the Commonwealth we are controlled by the London Shipping Conference, which, in its turn, is controlled from the United Kingdom. The Empire, so far as I can, understand it, .is self-contained. At the present time we are a nation within a league of nations, and if we can arrange for the Imperial Government and the Dominions Governments to take united action to limit the percentage of profit that may be made by any individual, we shall have a reasonable chance of grappling with the ever-increasing cost of living."
"I did not say anything of the kind, and the honorable member must not put statements into my mouth which I did not utter."
"The honorable member prided himself upon being the only member of this Chamber who does not interject, and I want him to live up to that reputation. He waxed fairly eloquent in regard to the Whitley report. I invite honorable members to peruse the cables that have been published in our daily newspapers during the past few days, and to say what is going to be the fate of the Unionist party in the House of Commons? Why, 200 members have already waited upon Mr. Bonar Law, their leader, and have stated emphatically that, if the Government are going to indorse the Whitley report, there will be ructions in the political arena."
"I recognise that South Australia has always done its duty in that connexion. We have no right to delay in this matter. If the party opposite were in earnest, and if the Prime Minister were in earnest in a desire to 'remove the disabilities under which the people of Australia suffer, they would have submitted at the election in 1917 a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution. Had that been done, what would have been the result? Seeing that we were even then feeling the pinch of the profiteer and the exploiter, I believe that the people would have consented to the amendment necessary. I suppose that a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution will be on the political menu which will be presented to the people at the coming elections. Every one knows what the Labour proposal will be. It has been my individual proposal for a long time. I have long said that I questioned whether an ordinary amendment of the Constitution would be satisfactory. I say that every Constitution in Australia should be put into the melting pot as soon as possible, that we might draw from it a National Parliament clothed with the powers which it was originally believed this Parliament would possess. We could then delegate to provincial councils - not State Parliaments - certain powers which they might appropriately exercise. Under existing conditions the State Parliaments have delegated certain powers to this Parliament and have kept us within well defined limits, which we cannot overstep or the High Court will pull us up. The distress at present prevailing is of such a character that something should be done at once to relieve the people. We cannot ignore the fact that men, women, and children who ought to be well clothed, well housed, well fed, and fully employed are to-day ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and in very many cases unemployed."
"Speeches of a similar character were delivered by many at that deputation. Mr. Hughes, prior to leaving for Great Britain, had intimated by a speech in this House, and by some action he took, that the Government intended to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry. This was one of those high-flown titles which are given to some organizations, and which, though they impress some people, never impress me. I never had very much faith that this organization would do much for our Australian industries. We told Senator Pearce that the Bureau would be of very slow growth, would probably be controlled by a number of university professors, and that very little benefit would accrue from it to the industries and workers of Australia. We pointed out to him that organization as necessary, in order to prepare for the time when the war had come to an end. I have not Senator Pearce ' s reply to the deputation, but I can give the effect of it. He said that he quite realized that the representations made by the deputation were quite correct, that the Bureau of Science and Industry could not meet all the demands of Australia, and would certainly not satisfy the people of Australia in making their industries prosperous, establishing new industries, and providing employment for the people. He said he would take the representations of the deputation to Cabinet, and that the Government would endeavour to evolve a scheme to meet their wishes. I make bold to say that, had the Government at that time taken in hand the proper organization of industry in Australia, we would not be in the muddle in which we find ourselves to-day in regard to demobilization and unemployment. We should have done it long ago, and we are late in taking action, but we must do something in this matter.  I am sorry that the honorable member for Fremantle is not here, because I propose to make a quotation from the London Times of 10th May of this year. I was looking over the file the other day, and from the latest number on it I extracted many valuable quotations. In the Times of the 10th May of this year there is an article which contains the following statement: -"
"Yes, this distress is increasing. I am not here to give expression to those eruptions that take place now and again, but it appears to me that what is happening now is symptomatic of the feelings in the community. For instance, I believe it is an absolute fact that in the constituency represented by the last speaker, the honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Burchell), it was necessary, recently, to restrain 200 returned soldiers, who were unemployed, from doing something serious by marching them through the various streets, singing songs until they had cooled down. This distress is present among soldiers, not only in Australia, but in Great Britain also. If any honorable member cares to read the English files - he will not find this information in the daily press of Australia, because it is carefully excluded in order to keep the people here in the dark - he will learn something of what is happening on the other side of the world. I believe, however, that the soldiers are making themselves heard in Great Britain to a greater extent than is the case here, and that the Imperial Government are making greater efforts to redress their grievances. Everybody knew, when the war broke out, that a considerable sum of money would be needed to pay our troops overseas, and while on war service, and to provide for their pensions and repatriation. Why, then, did not the Parliament exercise some of its powers, limited as they are under the Constitution, to obtain more revenue? Why did not the Government take over all insurance business - life, fire, and marine? I would even disregard any State proposition. At the outset of the war the British Government took over the whole of the marine insurance business, and made millions of pounds. Their control of this business is now helping them to pay the bill. Why should not Australia do the same, and obtain some of the big revenue that at present flows into the pockets of private individuals. France, I suppose, has done more in this direction, and enjoys more State monopolies than in any other countries. The latest State activity in France is the monopoly in the supply of petrol to the French people, by which the French Government expect to make £1,500,000 a year. Why should we not do the same in Australia? Why should not the Government control all supplies of kerosene, petrol, and other oils in Australia? Something should be done to develop the oil supplies of Papua and investigate our own resources. It would pay this House to set apart next Wednesday afternoon for the discussion of this subject, and to pass a vote of £500,000 for the development of our resources by boring, and the employment of such experts as Lord Cowdray obtained in Great Britain. For centuries the geologists of Great Britain had declared that there were no oil deposits within the United Kingdom., but quite recently a supply has been obtained at 3,000 feet. I understand a bore is yielding 400 gallons per day, and it is expected that further borings will very largely increase the supply.  The opinion of a geologist need not be regarded as final. Events have proved that a first class practical oil-borer - a man thoroughly conversant with oil discovery in all its phases - is often the better man to decide this important question. I deplore the apathy in regard to the oil resources of Australia. For some years boring operations have been carried out in South Australia, and we are extracting oil from our shale deposits in other parts of the Commonwealth. I believe that eventually large supplies will be obtained from Papua, but greater vigour should be displayed in research and in exploratory work. The proper course is to nationalize the distribution of oil supplies throughout the Commonwealth, and to do away altogether with private enterprise, thus securing for the Commonwealth revenue the large profits that are at present being made out of the business. I speak as one who has resided in the country during the past twelve months, and whose illuminant is kerosene. I know only too well how great has been the increase in its' price as compared with the time when, first, I lived in the country in 1902. We have now to pay nearly three times as much for a tin of kerosene. Why is this so? Some people say it is because shipping is short. I know, however, that that is not the only reason. I remember reading that when America entered the war, the Secretary of the United, States Treasury, Mr. McAdoo, declared that it would be necessary to levy heavy income taxation upon the people of the United States, and he had some figures prepared indicating how the wealthier individuals of the Republic would be taxed. Rockefeller, the great oil king, was shown to have an income of about £12,000,000 per annum, and under the new income tax schedule he would be called upon to pay about £7,500,000 a year to the United States Treasury. Some people might think this was a pretty heavy impost; but Rockefeller stretched out his long arm, and with his big fist he is now dragging from every user of American kerosene an extra price for this particular commodity. Every other user of kerosene in the Commonwealth is now helping to pay Rockefeller's taxation to the United States Treasury. Can it be expected that people who are on the verge of starvation will sit down quietly when they know that men like Rockefeller are day by day delving into their pockets and taking from them money which they can so ill afford to spare? I well remember what the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) said when the then Prime Minister (Mr. Andrew Fisher) introduced his first Income Tax and Probate Bill. The Acting Prime Minister, who was then a freelance, said he knew that a large number of people would be called upon to pay the tax because, and he added, 'There is going on in every community a nitration process, and this impost will filter down and down until it reaches bedrock,' Bedrock, he added, was represented by the working people of this country, who, because they could not pass it on, would have to carry the burden. Not only are the people being charged exorbitant rates for food, clothing, and on every article in everyday use, but they know they have to pay the rich man's taxes as well. With this galling fact staring them in the face, are they going to sit down quietly. Can it be expected that they will be amiable when they know that this robbery is. going on? I say that unless some redress is given, not only shall we hear the stamping of the feet and the shouting of voices, but I fear something worse will happen in this country."
"Such things are, undoubtedly, happening. The man to whom I have referred, and who is the breadwinner for six others, is to be thrown out on a literally and metaphorically cold world. There is nothing for him to do. Such a system will not lead to proper demobilization, or to the establishment of contentment throughout the community. The fiat should go forth from the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) that in such cases there shall not be disturbance of employment. There have been bungles in regard to repatriation, some of which occurred merely because the organization of relief was not begun soon enough. President Wilson said, immediately after the armistice, 'Now, you American governmental departments, get busy! Do not wait upon private initiative. The Government must establish works to provide employment for our people.' That was the right attitude, and it was prompt. We have made no such preparations.  With regard to the Tariff, honorable members opposite hold that it is right that we should wait for the return of Mr. Hughes, so that we may ascertain the proposals of the British Government. What bunkum! There are items in the Tariff concerning which we are entirely independent of Great Britain. Thousands of items are of a purely Australian character, and give employment solely to Australians. Why wait? An interim Tariff should have been introduced long ago. Certain industries to-day are dependent on the sometimes slender and brittle thread of Ministerial promises. But in some cases the thread has snapped. The promises of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) have not been kept, and, as a result, very many people have been thrown out of employment. Even the honorable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) would not embark on a big industry, entailing large expenditure, simply on a Ministerial promise. Some people did so, however, regarding the promise as emphatic; and what is required, in the light of their experience, is something in black and white in a Statute by way of protection. To their shame, there are people in Australia who, when it became known that, in consequence of the war, shipping would be short, and travelling to Europe dangerous, scuttled to Japan to arrange to bring goods manufactured in that country to Australia as quickly as possible. The quantity of such goods has increased by leaps and bounds, and I ask : What hope have we, under Australian conditions, of meeting such competition? In some articles recently published in a Melbourne newspaper we are told of thousands of boys and girls being kept in compounds in order that they may work for long hours each day in factories for a wage of 4½d. per head. The result is that there are Australians here who are buying goods created out of the blood and sweat of little Japanese children. How can Australian industries flourish under such conditions? Allied or not, we must have absolute prohibition if we are to protect Australian industries from competition of this kind. I do not know how the Free Traders propose to meet the position, but I have heard that some of them have been converted from their fiscal theories and fallacies; at any rate, they desire to make this country, so full as it is of raw material of every kind, as nearly self-contained as possible. Week by week men and women are being thrown out of employment, for the simple reason that Australia is using goods made under the conditions I have indicated. The highest wage paid to the most skilled artisan in Japan is about1s. 6d. per day, and it is only during wartime that the work people have been able to extract an extra 6d. We cannot profess to maintain the principle of a White Australia if the ports of the country are thrown open to the products of cheap labour of this kind. There would have been a certain guarantee to those who desired to start industries here if we had passed an interim Tariff. Had that been done, we could, at the close of the war, have considered our fiscal arrangements from beginning to end, and brought about an up-to-date Tariff."
"The conditions on the sugar plantations of Java and other places are deplorable, a good number being, I believe, under Dutch control, and the native labour employed under what is almost a system of slavery, or semi-slavery. The same may be said, unfortunately, of Fiji, and in this regard the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a good deal to blame. The conditions there are a danger to our civilization; and I believe they must have been largely brought about by the consent of the British Government. Fiji is only a Crown colony, and I cannot imagine that the importation of tens of thousands of Indian coolies could have been effected without the knowledge and sanction of the British Government. An official report by one who has visited the sugar-fields of Fiji, and a report from a representative of the Indian Government, are such a slashing condemnation of the operations of this company, and of others, that I feel sure the British Government, or some other Government, will, in consequence, make somebody 'sit up.'  Since the war terminated not only trade unionists and working people generally are asking for protection in England. I saw in the Times a great page advertisement, calling on the middle classes to form one great union, and there is a provisional executive, including many members of the House of Commons. The object is to have some organization by means of which the voice of the middle classes may be heard in. the efforts to solve some of the problems which confront the Old Country, and to safeguard them from being made the dupes and victims of profiteers. There is the same need in Australia for some such action, and, although I am a member of the Labour party, I believe that if I were to convene a meeting of those who call themselves the middle classes - though it might be difficult to define them - the attendance would be overflowing. Mr. Knibbs can work out his figures to the nicest fraction, but any intelligent house-wife will tell you what a difference there is between her bills five or six years ago and her bills to-day in the matter of groceries, clothing, and so forth. Indeed, it is a marvel to me how many in this community manage to live. The other night I was addressing a meeting, and mentioned, that so far as I could make out, £1 in 1910 would purchase as much as £1 13s. 10d. will to-day, and an interjector called out that the difference was really much greater. After the meeting the man who had interjected told me that, employed on the wheat stacks, he earned SA. 7s. a week, and that after providing for rent, union dues, and for his wife and six children, there was so little left that he could not afford to buy a decent suit in which to attend his union meetings. I could not disbelieve the man; and if that is the case with a wage of £4 7s., what must be the conditions in homes where the average earnings are £2 10s. to £3, and where the families are equally large, or larger. In my own electorate I find the streets where the working classes live full of youngsters, whereas in the more 'toffy' parts hardly a child can be seen playing about. The working men are the greatest producers in the country in more senses than one, and they provide that great essential, human beings. I know the electors of Dalley, for I lived there as far back as 1886; and I do not wonder at the honorable member (Mr. Mahony) pleading for the women and children who are suffering from hunger. Can we be surprised at the honorable member bursting the bounds of ordinary decorum, and smashing into smithereens the rules of this or any other House, when he thinks of the awful distress that prevails in that industrial centre. The Government must be held distinctly criminal if they allow the present state of things to continue, seeing that it can be so easily prevented. What is the good of the Government providing £1,000 to be doled out in relief? Our people do not want doles; they have proved their independence on the battle-field and on the cricket and football fields, and, manly and womanly as they are, they hate such parity. What they demand is work to exercise their muscles and brain, so that they may increase the wealth of the country, and enable us to meet the present financial position. Starvation and unemployment never did any country any good. Have we no national spirit or spirit of humanity? In Great Britain, even in the university arena, it is being realized that something must be done. But university appointments will not create bread, aud it is work and bread that are wanted now. The working people have made this country what it is, and they and their children ought to have a chance. With vigorous men and women, well fed and well clothed, Australia has a great future. Our agricultural areas are a mere nothing compared with the value of human souls; let us in all our legislation do that which will bring some relief to the sufferers in our community. I wish to see Australia living under peaceful and well-ordered government; but unless something is done we shall be in danger of happenings for which we shall be sorry, aud it is the duty of the Government to provide work and food for the people. Debate (on motion by Mr. Sinclair) adjourned."
