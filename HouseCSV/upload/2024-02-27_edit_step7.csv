"0","0","0","1","1","0","2","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Thank you to all those who have joined us here in the chamber today. I am going to commence my final contribution to this place in the same way I began my first one, in acknowledging the Gweagal people of the Dharawal nation of southern Sydney—a very special people, because they were the first to engage with Lieutenant James Cook on 29 April 1770. That place in Kurnell is a very special place. We speak a lot about reconciliation in this place, as we should, and my experience of that place as each and every year we gather in a ceremony of reconciliation, I think, speaks to the best spirit of that. I also spoke about that place in my maiden speech in this place. I said that it was important that we recognise this site, and I am so pleased that over the time that I have been here, we were able to achieve that.  On that site now, there is—artists call it an installation, others would call it a monument, and some might call it a statue—call it whatever you like, but I know what it means. There is the totem of the Dharawal people, the whale, and it's beautiful. There are many other installations around the shore, but the one which is most striking, as the tide comes in, laps on it and recedes, is the skeleton of a whale, but it is also the skeleton of a ship like the Endeavour. On each of the rings of that skeleton is inscribed the journals of Lieutenant James Cook. If you haven't been there, go there. It is a wonderful place to reflect on how two stories become one. For me that's what reconciliation with Indigenous people has always been about. We weave together the individual strands of individual Australians of so many different backgrounds and experiences, from our Indigenous peoples to the most recent citizens. Each strand unique, but together weaved as one. For me that site will always mean that, and it's wonderful to acknowledge it here today, as well as the artists and the so many who made that possible. As was my practice as Prime Minister, always, when acknowledging Indigenous Australians, I would also in the same breath acknowledge those men and women who served Australia in our defence forces, both those who served in the past and those who serve now, for the simple reason that they are the providers of our freedom. Everything we have in this country we owe to them. In one of my early days—the member for Blaxland is here—we trekked Kokoda together in the spirit of bipartisanship. He was a little quicker than me and still is. We trekked Sandakan, we trekked the Black Cat Track up there in northern Papua New Guinea and we also went on to Gallipoli. At the end of those treks we would stand together with the young people who were with us—whether it was at the Bomana cemetery or in Lae or Sandakan or elsewhere—and we would hold hands, look at those tombstones, thank them and commit ourselves to living lives that would be worthy of their sacrifice. It was incredibly moving. And we would say, 'They gave their tomorrows for our today.' So it is easy for us all in that spirit to acknowledge our defence forces, those who serve in them—and serve in them today, far from here and nearby—and simply say thank you for your service. Today is not an opportunity to run through a bullet point list of things. It is, importantly, an opportunity for me to simply express my thanks and appreciation and admiration for those who have made my service here in this place possible and to pass on what I hope are some helpful reflections from my time here that may assist those who continue to serve. Let me begin with my thankyous. Firstly and importantly, to my constituents in Cook: it has been my great privilege to have served you as your local member in this parliament for these past more than 16 years, where you have been kind enough to elect me on six separate—six successive—occasions. I thank you for the tremendous and steadfast support you've provided to me and my family, who join me here today, during this time. Whatever was going on at the time, whether it be success, failure and everything in between, when I returned to the electorate—and those who know the area will know what I'm talking about—and particularly as I went up the rise of the Captain Cook Bridge and descended into God's country itself, the shire, I would feel a great sense of belonging. I would feel a great sense of reassurance and peace. All of us who live there know this. This is as much, though, about the people as it is the place. It is home and always will be. Mine is a community that is unashamedly proud of our country, that deeply values family life and what it takes to live a life that keeps families together, that works hard. They take responsibility for themselves. They appreciate and respect both their own and others' good fortune, and they are generous to those around them, celebrating their successes or providing a hand up whenever and wherever it is needed. It is also a community that enthusiastically shares and supports and maintains the important community and social infrastructure that preserves our way of life. It is a community that does not leave it to others, including the government. Mine is a community that does not look for what it is owed but what it can contribute, for how it can make a contribution, not take one, both nationally and locally. They are a community of patriots, and I am pleased to describe them as such in this place. In both my local and my national roles, including as Prime Minister, I have always been guided by the strong local values of my community—family, community, small business—and what I describe as the fair go for those who have a go. This is what makes the shire and southern Sydney such a great place to live and raise a family. And there are plenty of quiet Australians who understand that as well. Ever since I was first elected, I have always seen it as my job to try and keep it that way, and I believe I have honoured that commitment. I particularly thank the myriad of community organisations, sporting clubs, school communities, volunteers, small businesses, church and charitable groups that make our local community, as they do all of our communities, so great and so resilient, including my beloved Sharks. These groups and organisations are the heart of our community, and I've always enjoyed the role I have played to support and enable them in their efforts, and I'm proud of what we have been able to achieve altogether in our community over this time. I also want to thank my many local Liberal Party supporters and members, in particular Mike Douglas; Louise De Domenico, who was also on my staff; and my conference chairman and great friend, Scott Briggs, for always keeping the local show on the road. A special thank you also to our neighbours and friends in Lilli Pilli, Port Hacking and Dolans Bay. You had to put up with more than most—cameras, security, traffic, the odd protest and home invader. To Jamie and Anna and to Joe, Chrissie and Stan, I look forward to continuing return the favour of mowing your lawns for years to come. It will be quite some time before I settle that debt! A big thank you also—I'm sure Jenny would agree—to Rob and everyone up at D'lish. As politicians we know that we are the tip end of the spear. Yet, behind us, there are so many people who we are supported by. They are incredible, dedicated, professional, intelligent, loyal, good humoured, sacrificial and amazing people who, for reasons that I suspect will never cease to amaze all of us—and it certainly humbles us—choose to commit themselves to the causes that we have identified and we seek to champion as members of this place and, when we have the opportunity, in government. They become a family. They support one another. They form close and lasting relationships, together embarking on one of the great seasons of our lives. I have been blessed in this area more than I could ever deserve. From my local office team in the shire, especially to Julie Adams; to the incredible professionals who headed up and worked in my prime ministerial and ministerial offices, especially Dr John Kunkel, Phil Gaetjens and Anne Duffield; and to my longstanding original staff Latisha Wenlock and Julian Leembruggen, who is here today: the journey would simply have been impossible without you all, all of those you ably led and all who worked together in these causes, so many of whom are here today—and I thank them for being here. There are too many of you to mention all by name, and nor do I wish to injure your reputations by doing so! But I hope you all feel the full partnership of our service together and what we were able to achieve and contribute. Thank you. I also wish to thank all those who cared for me and my family over the years when I was Prime Minister, as the Prime Minister now would know. To our household staff at the Lodge and at Kirribilli, led by the beautiful Trina Barrie and the incomparable Adam Thomas: you provided a space for Jen, Abbey, Lily, Buddy, Charlie and I to be a family. Thank you. To the members of my close protection team at the AFP over the years, who continue to look after us even on the odd occasion these days: thank you. I want to specially mention Travis Ford and Jen McRae, who were terribly injured in the line of duty, protecting me in a terrible car accident in Tasmania. I will always be grateful for your sacrifice. When their colleagues rushed to them at the scene, their first words—not knowing what had occurred—were: 'Is the boss okay?' Thank you. To Mick: I'll be in touch about that fishing trip we talked about, as we promised each other on the road on so many occasions. To my parliamentary, ministerial and cabinet colleagues with whom I served over the years, some gone from this place now and many still here: I want to thank you for your support and your dedication. As your leader, you gave me your best in some of Australia's most difficult times. I asked you to follow and you did, and together we achieved an election victory that none thought possible, and we kept steady hands on the tiller during the greatest set of challenges that have confronted our nation since the Second World War. Thank you for your service. For the opportunities afforded to me by my party leaders over this time—to Brendon Nelson, to Prime Minister Tony Abbott and to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull: thank you. To my now party leader, Peter Dutton, with whom I served in cabinet through all the years of the coalition government: thank you for your respect, your loyalty, your support and your consideration, especially that which you've shown me as a ministerial colleague, as Prime Minister and as an ex-PM in your party room. Jen and I both appreciate the kindness and generosity you and Kirilly have shown to both of us and our family. For the great friendship and encouragement afforded to me by some very special friends as colleagues, to Big Mac, my Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack; and Catherine: thank you. To Josh Frydenberg, who I was speaking with this morning, and my deputy leader and Treasurer: thank you, Josh. To Marise Payne, to Greg Hunt, to Michaelia Cash, to good old Benny Morton and to Alex Hawke, who sits with me here today and who keeps me entertained each question time still—there's plenty to entertain us: thank you. And to those who've gone from here—to Steve Irons and Stuart Robert, who I flatted with for many years; to Lucy Wicks and the incomparable Bill Heffernan, who I flatted with for the first six years and survived; and Louise Markus—thank you. To the broader Liberal Party members and our supporters led by Andrew Hirst, John Olsen and Nick Greiner, thank you. To those who supported me from the Public Service as a minister, Treasurer and Prime Minister, thank you, especially for your service during the pandemic, which I extend to everyone in the Public Service, who showed the true spirit of what public service was with sacrifice and dedication. Thank you to Phil Gaetjens, who was the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, but, particularly, thank you also to Professor Brendan Murphy and Professor Paul Kelly, who became well-known figures. To General JJ Frewen, thank you. To General Angus Campbell and Greg Moriarty, thank you for all you did to help me secure AUKUS. When I left the job after the last election, when we lost, I remember saying to them, 'Now, please don't stuff it up,' which they are not, together with the Minister for Defence. To the Prime Minister, to the Deputy Prime Minister, to the members of your government and to Bill Shorten, we have contested fiercely in this place. I've had my wins and I've had my losses, but I wish you all well in your service of the national interest. Too often in this place we confuse differences of policy with judgements about peoples' intent and motives. This is not good for our polity. We may disagree but we need to honour the good intentions of all of us. I wish you well in your service, as I've said, and I especially want to thank you, Mr Speaker, for the special kindness and respect that you've shown to me in this place since the last election and here again today. To the Prime Minister and your now new fiancee, Jodie, congratulations on your engagement. Jen and I wish you all the very best for your life together. At some point, this all ends and, while there are no hard feelings, I'll obviously be supporting my colleagues and Peter Dutton to ensure that that day hastens sooner rather than later. But, when it does, you will look around and Jodie will be there, and I can assure you—as Jen has been to me—it makes a world of difference. When I first entered politics, the former member for Parramatta, Julie Owens, who many of us remember well, gave new members some good advice at our orientation about making sure you do not neglect the friendships you had before you came. I took this advice very seriously. I'm even more pleased that my friends and family did. Thank you to our wonderful friends that are here today—to Karen and Adrian Harrington; to David Gazard, the 'Gaza man'; to Arthur and Ingrid Ilias; to Bill and Anne Knock; to Peter Verwer; to Scott Briggs, who couldn't be here today; and to Lynelle Stewart—we love you very much and appreciate you. To my Christian pastors, Brad and Alison Bonhomme, to Mike and Val Murphy, to Joel and Julia A'bell, to Jock Cameron and to my brothers in Christ, Andrew Scipione, John Anderson and Lloyd Thomas, who's here with his wife Fi today, thank you for your prayers, your counsel and your encouragement. I also especially want to thank Bishop Antoine Tarabay and all of our Maronite brothers and sisters—I've become an honorary Maronite, I think, in the years past—and especially our dear friends Danny and Leila Abdallah, Bridget Sakr and Craig McKenzie, who have taught us all what faith is really all about. As most people know, subject only to God, my family is the centre of my life, and at the very centre of our family is Jen. I cannot imagine life without her. I love you, Jen, and always will—that is the cross you have to bear. Your love has been my stay and strength. You are the other half of our joined soul, who, by the grace of God, brought Abbey and Lily—our miracle girls—into our lives, who we celebrate and love. I thank Abbey and Lily for their own sacrifices as they have grown, necessitated by having a father in public life. They are beautiful girls in every way, as you can see, and I could not be more proud of them as a father. They are our joy and our delight, and I am so pleased that we can now have the time that was necessarily denied us for so long. In preparing for this day, Abbey and Lily suggested that I should play a type of Taylor Swift bingo, and I'm wearing the bracelet, by the way—it has 'ScoMo' on it. They said to try to work the names of every single Taylor Swift album into my remarks. Well, what's a dad to do? Here I go! It is true that my political opponents have often made me see red. When subjected to the tortured poets who would rise to attack my reputation, in response I have always thought it important to be fearless and speak now or forever hold my silence and allow those attacks to become folklore. Ever since leaving university—in 1989!—this has always been my approach. My great consolation has always been my lover Jen, who has always been there for me whenever I need her, from dawn and beyond the many midnights we have shared together. See, I'm actually a true new romantic after all. I can assure you there is no bad blood, as I've always been someone who's been able to shake it off! Anything for my daughters. I also want to thank, of course, Jen's mum, Beth, who is looking after the cat and the dog today, and Jen's late father, Roy, an amazing human being, for always being on my side; as well as Jen's siblings, Gary and Cecily, and all their families. Finally, I thank my mum, Marion, who is here with my late father, John, today together. I also want to thank my brother, Alan, of whom I am extremely proud. My family, growing up, were the dominant example for my life. They taught me that life is about what you contribute, not what you accumulate. They taught me about the duty and dignity of public service, but, beyond this, I would never have known God and my saviour, Jesus Christ, if it was not for them. I can think of no greater gift. Okay, that's the emotional stuff done! You're not used to seeing that side of me. Having said my thankyous and expressed my appreciation, I would now like to reflect on just three things I have learned along the way that may help those dealing with the challenges of the future who continue in this place. The first of these is that, without a strong economy, you cannot achieve your goals as a nation. All good government must start with nurturing a strong, innovative, dynamic, entrepreneurial, market based economy. In the 1980s we threw off the shackles of the federation institutions that Paul Kelly, who is here today, wrote about in The End of Certainty as holding our economy back. This led my generation into 30 years of economic change that, despite some missteps along the way, including a recession we had to have, produced the longest period of continuing economic growth that any nation in the modern world has known. There have been strong contributions made to this achievement by both sides of politics, which I acknowledge—always, though, with Liberal and National support. As we entered the pandemic, I was pleased that, after almost six years of painstaking fiscal effort, we had restored our budget to balance and maintained our AAA credit rating. This was achieved by focusing on economic growth and containing growth in public spending. At the time, our government had the lowest rate of growth in public spending of any Australian government for decades. This would prove vital in the years that followed. Having saved for a rainy day, it was now raining. It was pouring, and we had to respond. Australia would emerge with one of the lowest fatality rates from COVID in the developed world. When compared to the average fatality rates of OECD countries, Australia's response saved more than 30,000 lives. We were described as the gold standard of COVID responses by Bill Gates at the Munich security conference and the second-most COVID prepared nation by the Johns Hopkins Institute. This will always be to Greg Hunt's great credit and that of all those he worked with—his eternal credit. It is also true that, during the pandemic, the rate of death by suicide actually fell and remained down in 2021. This was nothing short of an answer to prayer and the extraordinary efforts of our mental health workers, professionals and services, and I want to acknowledge Professor Pat McGorry and Christine Morgan, who were incredible supports to me during that time. Our plan was not just about saving lives but about saving livelihoods as well. This was achieved with Australia emerging with one of the strongest economies through COVID. Our historic economic response kept 700,000 businesses in business, it kept more than a million Australians in work and, despite these unpredicted outlays, Australia was one of just nine countries to retain a AAA credit rating. Our response was timely, it was targeted and it was temporary. We responsibly retired measures as soon as it was prudent to do so, leading to a historic reduction in the actual budget deficit, with the budget even moving into structural surplus during COVID. As Josh asked me to remind everyone this morning, the unemployment rate had a '3' in front of it when we left. JobKeeper and the myriad of economic supports—designed by Josh and me, with Mathias Cormann and later Simon Birmingham and the whole team at Treasury and the ATO—would have been fanciful had we not entered into this crisis with a tank that was full. We cannot take our economy for granted. Employers and businesses creating jobs is how you run a strong economy and put a budget into structural balance and keep it there. During my time in this place I observed that many of the old partisan differences on economic policy have, regrettably, re-emerged. In 2019 we fought an election on this and we prevailed in our miracle election win. Looking forward, we must be careful not to reinstitutionalise our economy. Such an approach will only negate the capacity we have as a nation to deliver on the essentials that Australians rely on; it will crush entrepreneurial spirit and that wonderful spirit of small business, and leave us vulnerable in the face of new threats to our sovereignty. That brings me to my second point. Those threats are there and they're real. During my time in this place, and especially as Prime Minister, we have seen an end to the post-Cold War period of globalisation and the emergence of a new era of strategic competition, where our global rules based order is being challenged by a new arc of autocracy. This arc of autocracy, which I referred to as Prime Minister, ranges from Pyongyang to Beijing to Tehran and Moscow—a chord of would-be regional hegemons who would prefer power to freedom and care little for the price their own citizens pay to achieve their ends. For this reason our government stood firm against the bullying and coercion of an aggressive Chinese Communist Party government in Beijing who thought we would shrink when pressed. Indeed, we not only stood firm but worked with our allies, our partners and those in our region who wished to protect their own sovereignty to counter this threat to regional peace, prosperity and stability. AUKUS, the Quad, new trading and defence relationships, the first ever comprehensive strategic partnership of any nation with ASEAN and others including PNG, and the Pacific Step-up—all designed to protect our sovereignty and stand up for a global rules based order that favours freedom, especially here in our own region in the Indo-Pacific. In this respect, I pay tribute to the work of Marise Payne and Dan Tehan, as well as Simon Birmingham. I thank the Trump and Biden administrations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, my good friends Boris Johnson, James Marape, Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo and Robert O'Brien. I pay tribute to late and great Shinzo Abe and his successors, prime ministers Yoshi Suga and Fumio Kishida. The 2022 election may have provided an opportunity for Beijing to step back from their failed attempts at coercion, but we must not be deluded: tactics change but their strategy remains the same. We are not alone in waking up to this threat. Investors are now, rightly, pricing the risk of their investments in an authoritative communist China, while consumer advocates are waking up to human rights abuses and the environmental degradation that infects these supply chains. This requires continued vigilance and the connection between all spheres of policy to create and protect supply chains and integrate and align our strategic and military capabilities so we can protect our sovereignty and counter the threat that is real and building. In Tehran, we find the funders, trainers and apologists for terrorists, seeking to acquire the most deadly defence technology imaginable: nuclear weapons. Their green light for the Hamas terrorist attacks on innocents in Israel, on 7 October, is unforgiveable. In response to such overt attacks there can be no equivocation on where we stand as a representative democracy when another, who has been such a great friend of Australia, is under attack. There also can be no equivocation in calling out the anti-Semitism that has now occurred in this country, to our shame, and in other places across the Western Hemisphere in the wake of 7 October. To that end I am pleased to acknowledge the presence today of the Israeli ambassador, Amir Maimon, in the chamber today. Am Yisrael Chai. In Ukraine, fighting continues to rage two years after Russia's illegal invasion. I'm proud of our swift response to support Ukraine. This must continue and is utilising every resource and capability we can reasonably provide. Ukraine may be a long way from Australia, but the implications of a Russian victory will reverberate just as quickly in our own hemisphere, emboldening again those who seek to challenge our region. My third point is: how do we stand and on what ground? We stand on the very same ground that established our western civilisation and that inspired and enabled the modern, pluralist representative democracy we now enjoy. We stand on the values that build a successful, free society, like individual liberty, the rule of law, equality of opportunity, responsible citizenship, morality and liberty of speech, thought, religion and association. All of these stem from the core principle of respect for individual human dignity. So do representative democracy and even market based capitalism. This is a unique Judaeo-Christian principle. It is about respecting each other's human dignity through our creation by God's hand, in God's image, for God's glory, where each human life is eternally valued, unique, worthy, loved and capable. This is the very basis for our modern understanding of human rights. With the advance of secularism in western society, we may wish to overlook these connections or even denounce them. But the truth remains. Human rights abuses were once called crimes against God, not just against humanity. They are, and they remain so. These truths are not self-evident, as some claim, as history and nature tells a very different story, though divinely inspired. You don't need to share my Christian faith to appreciate the virtue of human rights. I'm not suggesting you do. But, equally, we should be careful about diminishing the influence and the voice of Judaeo-Christian faith in our western society, as doing so risks our society drifting into a valueless void. In that world, there is nothing to stand on, there is nothing to hold on to, and the authoritarians and autocrats win. In the increasing western embrace of secularism, let us be careful not to disconnect ourselves from what I would argue is our greatest gift and the most effective protector of our freedoms—the Judaeo-Christian values upon which our liberty in society was founded. Even if you may not believe, it would be wise to continue to understand, respect and appreciate this important link and foundation. To conclude, you'll be pleased to note a warning about politics, where I've spent most of my professional life, as most of us here have. I know that all political philosophies and ideologies, including my own, are imperfect and regularly confounded by events outside our control. I experienced this firsthand leading Australia through the global pandemic. In my experience, the practice of politics is largely about contesting which approaches are less imperfect than others—in my view, those are the approaches of the Liberal Party—and then trying to humbly appreciate and compensate for their imperfections. It's like Winston Churchill's famous line, and I paraphrase: 'Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others.' While a noble calling, politics can only take you so far, and government can only do so much. You can say the same thing about the market. You won't find all the answers there, either, and you won't find it in unrestricted libertarianism and more-command-and-control communism. In the Liberal Party, we have always believed in how great Australians rather than governments can be, with the true test being how we can enable Australians to realise their own aspirations. I suspect that much of our disillusion with politics and our institutions today is that we have put too much faith in them. At the end of the day, the state and the market are just run by imperfect people like all of us. While politics may be an important and necessary place for service, I would also warn against it being a surrogate for finding identity, ultimate meaning and purpose in life. There are far better options than politics. In The Dignity of Difference, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote that the great tragedies of the 20th century came when politics was turned into a religion and when the nation, in the case of fascism, or the system in communism, was made absolute and turned into a god. I leave this place not as one of those timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat. I leave having given all in that arena, and there are plenty of scars to show for it. While I left nothing of my contributions on that field, I do leave behind in that arena, where it will always remain, any bitterness, disappointments or offences that have occurred along the way. I leave this place appreciative and thankful, unburdened by offences and released of any of the bitterness that can so often haunt post-political lives. This is due to my faith in Jesus Christ, which gives me the faith to both forgive and be honest about my own failings and shortcomings. During my time as Prime Minister, the power and necessity of forgiveness was demonstrated to me most profoundly by the Abdallah and Sakr families, whose children were taken from them, and they found the strength in their faith to forgive. For those who perhaps may feel a bit uncomfortable with my Christian references and scripture references here or at other times, I can't apologise for that. It says in Romans 1:16: 'For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.' It says in 2 Timothy 1:17: 'I am not ashamed for I know what I believe and in whom and I am convinced that He is able to protect what I have entrusted to Him until that day.' In that vein, let me quote one last scripture in this place as an encouragement to all who continue to serve. 2 Thessalonians 2:16 says: 'Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God and our father, who has loved and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace, comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and deed.' Thank you all those who join me here today or are listening elsewhere for your kind attention. As always, up, up Cronulla! on indulgence—I thank the member for Cook and the former Prime Minister for what was a very thoughtful, generous and warm final speech in this place. He has certainly left nothing on the field, and he can be proud of that fact. He has shown a real respect for this parliament in giving that speech here today and, importantly, a real respect for the people of his electorate, because none of us have other titles unless we have that very important one of MHR, member of the House of Representatives, for our particular electorates. I know that he is very passionate about and proud to represent the Sutherland shire for the electorate of Cook. I also give my respect to the former Prime Minister for the public recognition that he gave that all of us in this place rely upon so many others—our electorate officers, our ministerial staff, public servants and, as he said, our CPP. I well remember the news of the accident in Tasmania on that day. I spoke with the then Prime Minister on that day to check that he was okay and to check that the police officers who serve us and protect us were okay as well. I confirm that the then Prime Minister was very emotional about feeling that other people had been hurt in protecting him. That was to his great credit, and I acknowledge that. He has had so much support. We all ride on other people's shoulders to get here, and more important than any of the paid staff in various roles are, of course, the unpaid staff and they're sitting up there as well with you today. I can say, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that Prime Minister Morrison was a truly formidable opponent, and that to win an election is a big deal. Not many people have done it. To be one of the 31 prime ministers is something that can never be taken away, and I know that when you leave this place, Mr Morrison, you'll always be former prime minister Morrison. In the United States, they acknowledge these things differently, of course, and I suspect you may go to the United States, as do other people afterwards, just so that you keep that title of Prime Minister! It's an interesting tradition. When I was first called 'Deputy Prime Minister' when I was there after 2013, I hadn't quite clicked at that tradition. It says something about the respect for the office, which is so important. We always knew that, whatever the circumstances, this was a person who would bring 100 per cent of his energy and determination to the political contest. That was something that was acknowledged by Labor. It won you the admiration of your Liberal and National party colleagues. In 2019, that was very successful in your election at that time. I also want to acknowledge the contribution that the member for Cook has made as a parliamentarian. Your first speech in this place was16 years and two weeks ago. More than half of that time was in government and indeed in cabinet, and, for nearly half of the time in government, you were serving as Prime Minister—as I said, one of only 31 people to know that incredible honour. You and I have had our differences, but we have absolutely agreed—absolutely agreed, and I hope that you have the same view that I have, which is that we do not doubt for one second that this is the greatest country on Earth and that our job, wherever we come from in the political spectrum, is to try and make the greatest country on Earth that much greater by what we do each and every day. As Prime Minister during a once-in-a-century pandemic, the member for Cook was confronted with a challenging set of circumstances and just so many unknowns. This was an unprecedented time. It was a time of real anxiety amongst so many Australians, especially in those early days. It required decisions to be made that, if you had said prior to 2019 that a government, with the support of the opposition, would literally work with states and territories to stop people leaving home, to stop social interaction, to stop the normal activity that we engage in in this great country, and that it would close borders, not just national borders but state and territory borders as well, you would have thought that was something of fiction—that that would not be possible. We shouldn't take for granted the fact that those decisions were made and that that required leadership by yourself as Prime Minister and by the premiers and chief ministers working together across the political aisle. It required us, as the opposition, to sit in the cabinet room for some discussions, as well as in this place, and say what hasn't often been said by an opposition, which is: 'Regardless of what happens, we will vote for what is put forward.' That is what we did, in order to provide not just political certainty but, critically, economic certainty and social certainty, and the confidence that the Australian public required of their political leaders at that time in order to make personal sacrifices. No-one had ever envisaged Australians being put in a position to make such sacrifices, whether as individuals, as businesses or through the family unit. In your speech today, you spoke about good intentions. I don't doubt that everyone at that time had good intentions. Not everything was perfect, but today is not a day to dwell on that. Today is a day to say that everyone went into those processes with good intentions, and I don't doubt for one second that that was the case. So many of those decisions were critical, and it was important to project confidence. The nation needed that confidence. I'm sure that in the solitary moments, of which there were too many for all of us, due to the COVID restrictions, you must have gone through some really difficult times in trying to reassure yourself that the decisions that were being made—big decisions—were the right ones. I don't doubt for one second that the motivation in that was absolutely right. In your first speech you said, 'Family is the stuff of life.' All of us know that serving in this place takes a toll on family life, including during that period, of course. For the member for Cook, I imagine this will be a day of some mixed emotions, as farewells always are. For your daughters this will be a day of joy. And congratulations, Abbey and Lily, on encouraging your dad to work in that Taylor Swift reference! It was quite an achievement to go through all of those album titles and add in some song titles as well, just to complete the picture—to fill in the blank space, so to speak. It is fantastic that you're joined by your beloved mum, Marion, and she is very welcome here. We've had private discussions—I'll let the gallery in on a secret: even the toughest of political opponents can have private discussions—and I know that today you'll be feeling a sense of loss for your father. Jenny, I want to take this moment to acknowledge the dignity and diligence with which you have performed your role in public life. It is a difficult role. There's no script or manual, unlike in the United States. It's a very different system. And I thank you, Scott, for your personal wellwishes for myself and Jodie going forward. You're right: you always think about the things that really matter and the people around you when you leave this place, which we all will—hopefully not for some time, but you do think about those things. Family is so important. I know how critical Jenny's support was for you during your public life, particularly during what was an incredibly difficult period when you were Prime Minister during the pandemic. On behalf of the nation, thank you to the Morrison family. As Prime Minister, I will be so bold as to say I speak on behalf of the entire nation because I do believe in that respect. Scott—I'm going break with protocol there and not be pulled up with a point of order—I wish you every success for your future. Thank you for the service that you have given to this place; to your community in the great Sutherland Shire; to your party, the Liberal Party, of which you are a proud servant; and to your nation. on indulgence—I thank the Prime Minister for his fine and very heartfelt words in response to the contribution today. It's a day of deep emotion right across the chamber. That was evidenced in the Prime Minister's contribution. It was certainly evidenced in Scott's speech as well. On behalf of our party, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our 30th Prime Minister and the 14th leader of our party. I thank him for the sacrifice that he made for our country and I thank him for the way in which he led our party. Sixteen years is a very significant contribution to public life. That period has a punctuation mark today, but I'm sure in many ways it will continue. In his maiden speech, the member for Cook predominantly spoke about three issues: family, faith and the Australian vision. He also spoke about a fourth, which he spent a lot of time on today, which is forgiveness. There's a consistency in Scott Morrison that we saw 16 years ago, and that was evidenced again today. I think that's really what has been at the heart of Scott's continued success as a leader, as a prime minister, as a local member, as a father and as a husband. He has endeared himself to many colleagues over the course of his journey for that very reason. Scott was quite modest in his speech today, but we can go back through some of his significant achievements, not just as Prime Minister but as immigration minister and as Treasurer. He retained the AAA credit rating, presided over a series of decisions which were tough decisions but ultimately in the country's best interests and delivered us back to a balanced budget position after a fairly precarious inherited position. He made decisions that ultimately, although not known at the time, put our country in the best possible position to deal with the scourge of the COVID-19 pandemic. There were many of us who worked closely with Prime Minister Morrison at that time, and it was confronting, certainly from where I sat. There were the initial briefings that we received from the Chief of the Defence Force, from the Chief Medical Officer and from the experts otherwise and there was the intelligence that we were receiving from Europe and about what was happening in North America and elsewhere. As the Prime Minister rightly pointed out, the decisions that Scott was able to take really steered us through a very difficult course and put our country onto a path that we should be very proud of. They were decisions in relation to the health portfolio, and the former Prime Minister rightly acknowledged Greg Hunt for the work that he did in literally saving lives. There are many things that you can hang your hat on after a 16-year career, but having had the leading role in saving tens of thousands of lives of fellow Australians who would not have survived otherwise has to be at the top of the tree. As Scott pointed out, they were not just lives but livelihoods. To this very day, whenever we move around and speak to individual business owners or employees, countless people across the country cite the fact that their business would not have survived. There are 700,000 of them and over a million employees, a million Australians, who ultimately would not have been in the position that they were without the decisions taken by Prime Minister Morrison, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and others who sat around that National Security Committee decision-making body. That is one hell of a legacy. But it didn't stop there. I think Prime Minister Morrison's crowning achievement has been the AUKUS deal that was struck between the United States and the United Kingdom. I can tell you it was no easy feat. The Americans had only shared their closest held secrets with the Brits in the 1950s, and, despite numerous requests from very close allies during the intervening period, they had not decided to share that secret and have that confidence in another leader up until their interaction with Prime Minister Morrison. It will be the underpinning of our security for decades to come in a very uncertain world. Scott Morrison has that as part of his legacy. It doesn't stop there. Scott was able to bring Japan and India together in the QUAD and form a very close relationship, as he said, with the then Japanese Prime Minister, who was tragically lost, but also Prime Minister Modi as well. They had a mutual respect for each other and they knew that it was in the best interests of our respective countries, but collectively, to be able to come together to provide support for each other, not just now but into the decades ahead. Again, that was a very significant achievement. I think it's true to say that the Prime Minister, as he then was, stood up immediately in a way that not many other world leaders did in relation to Ukraine. One of my proudest moments in this place, Scott, was seeing the decisions that you swiftly took to provide support to people, which ultimately went to your values of faith and family and your vision, particularly in relation to humanity. The decisions that you took and that we took in government supported the people of Ukraine and the bravery of President Zelenskyy and ultimately resulted in saving the lives of men, women and children to this very day. You spoke very passionately about the rise and the unacceptable incidents of antisemitism that we see in our country today. It is endemic and it is shameful. You had the courage to stand up, consistent with your long-held values, to call that out, to be a friend of Israel and to provide support to people, who, on 7 October, had suffered the most horrific attack since the Holocaust, when six million people were gassed. You stand as a world leader, as a result of all of that combined, that we can be very proud of. I want to say thank you, on a personal level. We did have an exchange in 2018, as I recall, but when we came out of the meeting that day you were gracious enough to extend the hand of friendship to me, and I pledged to you on that day that I would serve you loyally. Together, since that day, I think we've been able to bring our party together in a way that wasn't possible for the period after 2007. I'm very grateful that that friendship continues today and long into the future. I wish you every success that you deserve into the future. I wish Jenny and the girls every success. The two beautiful young adults we see today, Abbey and Lily, were little girls, and we watched them grow up. They might watch the footage now and think, 'Why did I wear that? Why did I say that? Why was my hair cut like that?' as my kids often do. You have so much to be proud of. In this place, as the Prime Minister rightly points out, family is often forgotten. There will be a lot of cynicism in some of the reporting of Scott's speech, with its references to his faith and to his God. In this age of inclusion those people, who would normally parrot the fact that we need to be more inclusive and that our society needs to be more tolerant, will be the people who scribe tomorrow in a cynical way the words that Scott—in a very heartfelt way—conveyed to us today. There's a significant amount of irony in that. It's not going to change. That's the reality of the world in which we live. For Abbey and Lily, they know that they've been born into an amazing family, and Jenny is central to all of that. She's been graceful, she has been supportive, she's been generous and the country saw in her—at that time and since—somebody with a very big heart and somebody who loved her husband very dearly. So I want to say to the Morrison family, thank you for sacrifice and thank you very much for the contribution that you have given to our country. To Mrs Marion Morrison today and, in his absence, to John, thank you very much for the values you've instilled even to the current generation. The legacy that you have presided over is significant in itself. My closing words are to Abbey and Lily. Thank you very much for facilitating that daggy dad moment, as well, where your father went through, at your wish, to detail the Taylor Swift songs. He got away with it and it shows the influence that you have on his life, which is a very special thing. We wish him every success and good fortune and good health into the future. He has served our country with great distinction and we honour him today as a leader of our party and as a leader of our great country. on indulgence—Jane McNamara is one of those rough-and-tumble, down-to-earth, say-it-as-it-is mayors we all know and love in regional Australia. She's been mayor of Flinders Shire, centred on Hughenden in north-western Queensland, for eight years. Jane is someone who can see a fake, a fraud, a phony or someone who is insincere from a mile away. She rates highly one Scott Morrison, the outgoing member for Cook. 'Give him my best,' Jane said when I spoke to her last night. 'Tell him I'm sending virtual hugs his way.' Mayor McNamara well remembers the member for Cook's visits to Cloncurry, Julia Creek and McKinlay during the terrible natural disaster that hit her region in early 2019. The people in those far-flung Queensland towns have not forgotten those visits and nor will they. The member for Cook as Prime Minister brought funding and, perhaps more importantly, hope to those flood affected communities and they appreciated it. It saved them. Not only did he stop by but he returned later to see how they were faring. That is the measure of the man and underlines the leadership he showed on that and many, many other issues. I was there in February 2019 when the then Prime Minister told officials to get financial assistance in the bank accounts of devastated farmers within 24 hours. Those farmers had endured years of drought, but when the rain came it fell in biblical proportions and almost washed away the spirit of those hardy cattle producers. They were on the brink. Three years of rain had fallen in just 10 days. The Prime Minister was having nothing of bureaucratic delays and obfuscation. 'Get the money to them and do it within 24 hours,' he insisted and instructed. It was a decisive moment—stirring stuff, Morrison style. On 24 August 2018, the day the member for Cook was elected Liberal leader and later Australia's 30th prime minister, we had a meeting immediately after his party room ballot. I remember it clearly. As the Nationals leader at the time, I sat down with the Prime Minister designate to sort out the directions our parties—different but together—would go in on certain pressing issues. There are a number of them. I recall writing down two words, the member for Cook did the same, and then we showed each other. Both of us penned the same thing: 'Drought visit.' It was the start of our successful working relationship. We were different but we were together, and that's the way it should be. The following week the member for Cook and I found ourselves with Stephen and Annabel Tully at their 72,843-hectare Bunginderry Station at Quilpie, more than 200 kilometres west of Charleville—a long way from anywhere, you could say. It is in the electorate of Maranoa, represented by now Nationals leader David Littleproud. As the member for Maranoa said at the time, 'they're bred tough but no one is immune from this ongoing drought'. And he was right. Indeed, the Prime Minister saw the value of wild-dog fences, and other pest and weed management practices. They were valuable lessons for him to see firsthand and get a better understanding of farmers and regional, rural and remote Australians. Prime ministers of this country need to be the farmer's friend. The member for Cook was, in his time in the top job. He and I had any number of serious matters to deal with as Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister between 2018 and 2021. As I told Q+A: 'The golden age of Australian democracy'. Insert laughter here. But it was. Drought, bushfires, floods and then a global pandemic. The worst of those COVID-19 times brought out the best in Scott Morrison. He went above and beyond, working incredible hours to save lives and protect livelihoods. He was calm, publicly confident and dedicated. He was unflappable. I must say, our relationship survived some truly testing times for the nation and those even closer to home, such as the time when he stole one of my all-time favourite press secretaries, Dean Shachar, for his own office. Dean's in the advisors box now, and I'm still dirty on you, Scott, for doing that. But, anyway, we'll forgive and forget, as you've shown us the benefit of forgiveness today. Seriously, I do wish you, on behalf of the Nationals, all the very best, and I thank you for care, understanding of and delivery for those who lived beyond the bright city lights. Personally, on behalf of Catherine and I, and our family, thanks for your friendship, your support and your good humour. I'm not going to mention bad Santa, nor the census. Insert laughter here. May you, Jenny, your girls Abbey and Lily, and your mum, Marion, enjoy good health, happiness and every success in the future. Finally, Jane McNamara has a Droughtmaster—an appropriately named breed—steer named ScoMo 2. This, now 800 kilogram, bullock was a mere poddy calf, you'll remember, in the midst of the 2019 floods. And the Prime Minister gave it a feed as the cameras snapped happily away. Because of his fame from those photos, the calf got his name and a guarantee of a life of grazing. He won't know his life of contentment and happiness is due to the PM's intervention; he will not. In the same way, I guess, many Australians will never fully appreciate the efforts and work Scott Morrison put into ensuring that their lives, too, were better. Ultimately I believe history will be far kinder to the Morrison years of government than some are now. In the words of St John, Scott, you have fought the good fight, finished the race and kept the faith. Thank you. As we look to conclude the member for Cook's valedictory, I will just offer my brief comments. Thank you for your contribution to the community of Cook. Thank you for your contribution to the parliament. Thank you for your contribution to this nation. Go in peace as you embark on the next chapter of your life, my friend.","Valedictory","PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MORRISON (Cook) ","(12:01):"

For the information of members, if you look at the pace at which this debate has been going, while allowing people their full speaking time, a whole lot of people have been going short. I expect we'll probably be able to come close to finishing the debate tonight. If we're able to do that, it will leave time tomorrow for a much longer consideration in detail period than we've had for any other bill. I expect that would be more than enough. This motion simply says that, at 5.30 pm, if there are any remaining procedures to take place, they would take place at that point in consecutive occurrence. The reasons we're doing this on Wednesday rather than leaving it to Thursday are twofold. One is that, by going late tonight, we should have more than enough time for everyone to speak, including people who want to go for their full speaking time. Secondly, on Thursday—and I'll move the motion for this tomorrow—we have the address from President Marcos, which means capacity to finish the legislation at that point won't be available. I commend the motion to the House. We won't be supporting this gag motion from the government. This is yet another time in which this parliament is being treated in this way. Let me be very clear to the Leader of the House that we never object to sitting late to deal with legislation, which is essentially covered by his clauses (1) and (2). We always, where practical, oppose the guillotining of debate, and that's really what the government is doing here in clauses (3) and (4), regardless of the words just spoken. These would require that any remaining questions be put immediately without a debate at 5.30 pm, as the manager said. But, ultimately and in practice, it means there will be no further speakers on the second reading. That is essentially where we're at. Irrespective of consideration in detail, we think it's very important that our members get an opportunity to speak on the second reading. Let's not forget housing is a monumental crisis in this country. That's what the bill deals with. I think it's only fair that all members get a reasonable opportunity to speak. The bill can be debated when the House next returns in March. I can understand why the government would seek to move this bill. The Help to Buy scheme is quite an embarrassment at the time of the housing crisis, which has been necessitated by the poor decisions of this government. We have this paltry bill lobbed up to the parliament to replicate a scheme that exists in virtually every state around the country to create more shared-equity places, when there are literally thousands of shared-equity places that are going unused in those state schemes because Australians don't want these products. It's clear—and we've seen this before from the manager—that the government is so desperate for a win on Thursday that they're again trampling on the rights of the House. I had the benefit for many years of the very effective Manager of Opposition Business, as he was, being a bastion for the rights of members. He was a champion for the rights of members to have an opportunity to represent their electorates on matters of importance. The reality is that there are few issues more important to Australians at the moment than the housing crisis that's been necessitated by the poor decisions of this government. How on earth does that Manager of Opposition Business that I recall in my mind accord with a now habitual process of this government guillotining debate? I think it's concerning. Unfortunately, it's left again to the opposition to make sure that we have orderly and proper legislative process. I can understand why the government has not been particularly pleased with the debate on the Help to Buy Bill thus far. I can understand it is quite an embarrassment when you have inconvenient facts, like the futility of the scheme and the fact that it's very unloved around our country. I can understand why they would not want that being debated. But it wasn't the opposition who chose to introduce it. It wasn't the opposition who waited nearly two years before introducing this bill. It isn't the opposition who is hopelessly late. And, as I outlined in my contribution to the House at the time, when the government are two years late in delivering their homework and that homework is lobbed up in the state that this bill has been lobbed up, I can understand it is a source of absolute embarrassment. But in the end the Leader of the House should take that up with his minister. His disappointment in the minister should not manifest itself in guillotining debate to spare themselves the embarrassment that is caused each time they hear inconvenient facts, like that there are thousands of shared-equity places already going unused around this country. So, what's the answer to the housing crisis? More shared-equity places. It's nuts. That's why I move the following amendment to this motion: That paragraphs (3) to (5) be omitted. For the benefit of members, this simple amendment to the motion will just strike off the offending clauses (3) and (4) as circulated. It will also remove clause (5), which gives the government special powers to dictate the arrangement of business, again breaking every high-minded argument made by the now Leader of the House. I look forward to him channelling his former self and wholeheartedly supporting this motion. The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Buchholz ): Is the amendment seconded? Mr Coleman: I second the amendment. The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The question is that the amendment be agreed to. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing order 133 the division is deferred until after the discussion of the matter of public importance today.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","14","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","On a different note, I want to confirm, as I have said in private discussions with the minister, that the coalition won't oppose this bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Military Invalidity Payments Means Testing) Bill 2024. We have some experience on this side of the House in dealing with the consequences of the High Court decision in Douglas, which were far reaching for veterans in a social services way and in a tax and myriad other financial ways. The former government and now the current government are seeking, through this bill, to address the issues that emanated from a different interpretation from the High Court in the Douglas decision. So, in that spirit of understanding, we won't stand in the way of the bill, but we will seek further assurances that there are no unintended consequences resulting from this bill, the unintended consequences essentially being any negative consequences for our veterans community.  There's a little under a thousand people, we're assured by the government, who are likely to be impacted by these changes. They are essentially changes to the treatment of the assets test and the way in which the payments, which were the subject of the Douglas decision, are now treated. There are no adverse consequences for that cohort of just under a thousand people. Again, the government's given us an assurance—and I have no reason to doubt their sincerity—in seeking to ensure that those people who have served our country, as the former prime minister in his valedictory speech just said, who sacrificed so much to defend the freedom of our nation, are not in any way worse off as a result of these changes. We will seek to have this bill in the Senate go to a committee because, I must say, there have been some requests to us from the veterans community on a couple of issues to ensure that, as is promised, there are no negative consequences. We've sought assurances and advice on these matters from those veterans as well, and there does seem to be some uncertainty, which would benefit from this bill going to a committee and being examined in more detail. I appreciate the haste with which the government wants to legislate these changes, but I think that, for the veterans community's sake, we should really run the ruler over this closely, again not because I doubt the sincerity of the government but because this is a notoriously complex area and we shouldn't in any way, shape or form, for the sake of haste, progress this bill with any conceivable risk of veterans being worse off. Some of the concerns from stakeholders have been that clarification is needed on whether these amendments in the bill will exclude military disability pension income streams from asset assessments with regard to myriad family law matters. I won't go through all matters individually, but it's fair to say that a number of those concerns have been grouped with those who have financial orders and others in relation to family law matters. We also believe clarification is required on how the bill will affect the eligibility for family tax benefits, childcare subsidies or the low-income healthcare card. We believe that, ultimately, in the absence of the government having reached out to those groups and clarified precisely what the consequences would be, it should go to a committee. That will ultimately be a decision for the other place, but that is my preference, and the basis upon which we will be supporting this bill in the House is making sure we get those absolute assurances, because we do not want a situation where the government declare with certainty, as they have to me and as they have publicly, that no-one will be worse off. Indeed, the minister in the second reading speech gave a very clear indication that not only was the purpose to ensure that no veteran was worse off but that, in fact, no veteran would be worse off in practice, so it was concerning for me that a couple of the welfare organisations still had these questions, which also indicated a lack of consultation with the government in relation to them. If I may provide any advice to the minister, it's that, in treading in this space, you are well advised to consult very closely with veterans, because they understand their personal circumstances better than anybody. That is certainly the approach I took as a minister in the former government with regard to taxation matters that resulted from the Douglas decision. I won't detain the House on what I hope ultimately becomes a fairly uncontroversial bill to clean up understanding of the law in light of a High Court interpretation, but I reiterate to veterans that we are supporting this bill on the basis that there are no adverse consequences for any veteran. We've had those assurances from the government. We're concerned that the government hasn't necessarily assuaged the fears of veterans' organisations who've raised the matters that I've just outlined, so in that spirit we look forward to the government providing those assurances. And we think that going to a committee to briefly look at this to give comfort to veterans, who deserve that comfort, that they won't be worse off as a result of these changes is important, and that's the basis upon which we will be supporting this bill.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","16","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","This bill is called the Fair Work Amendment Bill, but it should be called the 'fix up the extraordinary incompetence of the Albanese government bill' because this is the bill where the government twice accidentally voted for criminal penalties for people who breach provisions of its right-to-disconnect stop orders. On two occasions, without actually realising that is what they were doing, the government went into the Senate and said that people who breach those rules should be guilty of a criminal offence. This is the most basic issue of competence, and it is a damning indictment on this government.  It's not that surprising, because they outsourced this piece of legislation to the Greens. This was the Greens idea, of course, and the government enthusiastically went along with it. They even helped the Greens draft the bill. So they helped the Greens draft the bill; they worked with the Greens on the bill, but then they claimed they didn't understand they were actually criminalising the activity. Government officials in Senate estimates have confirmed that the government and the department were aware of this amendment. I'll read directly from what those officials said: The department was aware of the amendment. It had provided advice to government on the drafting of the amendment and assisted with the drafting of the amendment … So the government's fully aware of the amendment on this so-called right-to-disconnect issue and nobody realised. The minister for workplace relations didn't realise. The Leader of the Government in the Senate didn't realise. Nobody in the government leadership team realised that they were about to walk into the Senate and vote to criminalise people who may breach this new provision. It is absolutely extraordinary! It's no surprise that there has been so much condemnation of this. The CEO of Wesfarmers Group, Rob Scott, who employs 120,000 people, said: But what has now happened is we've created additional red tape and complexity in what is already a very complex workplace relations system. That can't be good for anyone. He goes on: We're reducing flexibility, we're making it harder for harder for businesses to comply. And that can ... not only bad for businesses, but bad for wages over the long term. On top of all that, the government accidentally criminalised any breach of this provision. The government wants to add complexity. It wants to add red tape. It wants to make it effectively harder for people to comply. But do you know what it wants to do most of all? What the government wants to do most of all is curry favour with the Greens. The government needs the Greens to get legislation through the Senate. So when the Greens come up with something like this, including this extraordinary provision to criminalise breaches, the government goes along with it. It's a terrible indictment on the incompetence of the government. We will not be opposing this amendment, because it seeks to cure this extraordinary incompetence, but what an extraordinary reflection this is on the chaotic incompetence of the Albanese government.

Getting an appointment with a GP in my electorate has never been more difficult than it is today. An influx of population coupled with GPs reaching retirement age and the changes to the distribution priority areas have resulted in untenable numbers of people attending the emergency department out of pure desperation. Bulk-billing rates are the lowest we have seen in my electorate, with Cleanbill recently finding that not one regular GP practice offers bulk-billing to all patients and only a handful continue to bulk-bill for existing pensioners. We are yet to see any positive flow-on from the tripling of the Medicare incentive.  I met with a local GP, Dr Debra King, last week. She runs three practices in my electorate on the Mid North Coast with her husband. She was extremely concerned about the new payroll tax burden that is being placed on New South Wales GPs next financial year. This unnecessary tax will completely wipe out any benefit that the boost to the Medicare rebate has given and cause multiple practices around the regions to close. I urge everyone in New South Wales to put pressure on the Minns government to prevent this impending burden on our already stretched GP practices.

Established in 1964 when Para Hills was a new, developing community, the club initially played in the Hard Wicket Para Districts competition. In 1971-72 the club joined the Adelaide Turf Cricket Association, with Captain Bob Jones leading the A grade to an A8 premiership in that first year. By 2023 the club had scored 19 senior premierships and 14 junior premierships, four of those in a row from 2019 to 2023.  The success of the club can largely be attributed to the loyal group of committee members, volunteers and local players. This has resulted in 51 people receiving life memberships for their dedication to the club. The club continues to grow and has now introduced a junior girls pathway and an inclusive league team which were also 2022-23 premiers. In 2023 the Para Hills Cricket Club was awarded the South Australian Cricket Association community club of the year. Congratulations to President Tyson Roling and all the present and past club members, players and supporters on a wonderful first 60 years.

The former creates division and criticism to get attention at the ballot box; the latter is elected for their genuine care for their community. Forrest criticised the coalition, who he said are putting at risk the acceleration of our transition to renewables. Our government's policies, though, like Rewiring the Nation, the Hydrogen Headstart program and the Capacity Investment Scheme, are already great drivers of major change, which he well and truly acknowledged.  Captains of industry like Twiggy are calling for greater cooperation from political leaders to accept the reality that the global transition to green energy makes economic sense and to ensure Australia is in a position to take advantage of the immense opportunity this transition brings. Instead of blithering on the so-called virtues of small modular nuclear reactors—or, to use his words, those 'misinformed, unscientific, uneconomic, plucked out-of-thin-air bulldust of nuclear policies'—we can move faster and harder into the renewable future. If the opposition, the Liberals and the Nationals, will not listen to government, the economists, the scientists or your communities, then perhaps they should take a listen to industry.

But, with the housing affordability crisis, that dream is slipping away before our eyes. We all know it. We hear the stories of despair in our electorates every day of young people and young families being shut out of the property market. That's why I introduced into this parliament my first private members' bill, which would ban foreign property speculators from buying homes and units in Australia for two years. Many countries have already introduced such a law, including our Commonwealth cousins in Canada and Singapore.  Since the COVID pandemic, the activities of overseas property speculators have been ramping up big time. The National Australia Bank's recent residential property survey found that the market share of foreign buyers in new Australian housing markets in October to December 2023 grew, for the fifth straight quarter, to a 6½ year high of 11 per cent. In New South Wales, foreign buyers had a 15 per cent market share. We could make thousands of new homes and units available to Australians immediately, without having to take years to build them, by putting a pause on foreign property speculation and giving more Australians their shot at the great Australian dream. This is not about turning our backs on the world; it's about putting the interests of Australians struggling to get into the market ahead of the interests of cashed-up foreign property speculators.","Housing","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEE (Calare) ","(13:40):"

Dunkley is an electorate made up of mortgage holders, rent payers and working-class Australians. These are decent and hardworking people who make Australia and these are the people who will benefit the most when it comes to Labor's tax cuts. The Albanese Labor government has committed time and time again to supporting those who helped build this country and who contribute so much to the economy. We have introduced measures to help communities, including cheaper child care for those with little kids, cheaper medicines, electricity bill relief, increased rent assistance, more Medicare bulk billing, fee-free TAFE, building more affordable homes, expanding paid parental leave and getting wages moving again. Labor's tax cuts will make a real difference for the 13.6 million taxpayers across this country who will receive them, which is 2.9 million more than who would benefited from Scott Morrison's plan from five years ago.  I know that voters in Dunkley this weekend have a choice between a local candidate Jodie Belyea who supports billions in targeted relief and a Liberal mayor who has only increased the pressures on families, with massive local government rate hikes in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. Do the good people in Dunkley want to give their vote to a party who will rip up Medicare, that votes against wage growth and who has said no to our plan, at every step of the way, to help Australians? The choice is that simple. A vote for Julie Belyea is a vote for a local voice committed to helping the community of Dunkley.

That emotion was felt after seeing the Four Corners episode on supermarket power. We got a front seat witnessing the career implosion of the now former CEO of Woolworths, Brad Banducci. He attempted to smugly deflect an expert's opinion about their dominant power in the food and grocery market, a market that is concentrated to such a significant extent that it dwarfs comparable markets in countries like the US and the UK. It's such an overwhelming level of market power and concentration that shoppers, suppliers and farmers alike are going on record talking about the many negative impacts that such market conditions are having, from farm gate to table plate.  No market is well served by two companies with a combined market share of 65 per cent, and neither are everyday Australians, particularly those in my electorate of Spence. The Albanese Labor government appointed Dr Craig Emerson to lead the review of the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct, an important first step forward to curb power.

Ninety per cent of Australian women taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut, thanks to Labor. A childcare worker, a disability carer and an aged-care worker will get a bigger tax cut, thanks to Labor. It's gender-equity-lens policy design that brings a real benefit to women. The gender pay gap is the lowest it has been on record because of Labor. Today's figures are also a call to action.

It means that 84 per cent of taxpayers will be better off under this plan when the Senate passes this bill. Ninety per cent of women taxpayers will now receive a bigger tax cut. Those are the priorities of this government. We are making sure that people will earn more and keep more of what they earn. That is the core of this plan, and that is what we are delivering. Nurses, teachers and truckies will all be better off. Ninety-five per cent of them will get a bigger tax cut because of this plan.  One of the most important things we're doing with this plan is making sure that people on the lowest of incomes actually get a tax cut. So people earning under $45,000 will get a tax cut. Under those opposite, they got nothing—absolutely nothing. That's the priority of those opposite. In our reformed plan, those taxpayers earning under $45,000 will actually get a tax cut.

On 1 July this year our government wants to deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer, all 13.6 million of them. We want people to earn more and we want people to keep more of what they earn but there are some barriers to this. The barriers to this are, of course, the Liberals in the other place moving amendments to restore the principle of their unfair tax cuts on stage 3, and the Greens political party have foreshadowed amendments to kick it all off to a committee so the Senate can talk about it some more by the end of the month. We want these tax cuts to pass this week, because women in particular will benefit from our tax cuts. Ninety per cent of women will be better off than under the old Morrison plan.  This government has put economic opportunity for women at the heart of our agenda. Today we have required large companies to publish their gender pay gap and what that is about as transparency, making sure that people are aware of exactly what companies are doing. This has added to the support we have for feminised industries such as the 15 per cent aged-care worker increase that we have put in place. But those opposite do not even support that. Senator Canavan has gone onto the media saying the latest gender pay gap report is 'useless' and would encourage men to support men's rights activists like social media identity Andrew Tate—Andrew Tate! He said, 'This gender pay report must be the most useless set of data that a government agency has ever collected.' So while some of those opposite are out there saying this is a 'good thing' and even claiming credit for it, others are out there saying it is 'completely useless'. What the Senate can do, with the support of the Liberals and the Greens, is to vote for these tax cuts, and vote for them today. Vote for people to earn more and to keep more of what they earn—not stand in the way like the Liberals and the Greens want to do in the Senate. This is what Australians deserve to deal with cost-of-living pressures. The member for Fisher is interjecting continually during question time. He was yesterday and he's started today.

Mr Burke: Once again, in terms of asking questions to the correct minister for their responsibilities, I know that it's possible for the Prime Minister to take any question or for it to go to any other minister, but the direction of questions is consistently—if you listen to the whole preamble and where the question is headed—going to a different minister to the person who has policy carriage. I want to hear from the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Dutton: As is well known, included in the ministerial responsibilities for the minister for immigration are the criteria that need to be decided upon before he settles on the figure of 500,000 people a year. The reality is that the minister needs to take into consideration, as he would, the advice from Treasury, Finance and other departments about the impact of this Albanese government decision to bring in 1.6 million people in five years.

Of course, the Labor government is delivering on our promise to lead the way in closing the gender pay gap in Australia. Last year we passed legislation that would increase transparency and reporting for gender pay gaps, and today this data has been released. If those opposite were serious about this issue, they would immediately ask Senator Canavan to withdraw his comments about this data. If they are serious about it, they will rebuke him for the comments that he has made about the release of this data.  The Workplace Gender Equality Agency has published gender pay gap data for nearly 5,000 Australian private sector employers for the first time ever. This is a historic step towards transparency and accountability in addressing gender inequality. We have seen a median total remuneration gender pay gap of 19 per cent or equivalent to $18,461 a year. Thirty per cent of Australian employers have a neutral gender pay gap of within five per cent of zero, and that is good news, but it also means that over two-thirds of employers have a gender pay gap, which means that the majority of Australian workplaces have a long way to go to close their gender pay gaps. In every industry in Australia, the median of what a woman is paid is less than the median of what a man is paid. For all employers, the publication of their gender pay gaps is a call to action: a call to focus their performance on gender equality, to take action and to improve it. For employees and for consumers, this will provide insights and information about where they work. Women continue to be overrepresented in lower-paid roles and underrepresented in more senior, highly paid roles. That is why this government is working so hard to drive better outcomes for all workers, especially for women. Its actions are making a difference in women's lives—like the tax cuts that you are stalling at the Senate. They are tax cuts for every Australian woman taxpayer and will put money back into the pockets of Australian women. This plan will see a tax cut for every single woman who pays tax in Australia. Our plan will see Australian women taxpayers receive, on average, a tax cut of over $1,600 from 1 July and will see a bigger tax cut for over 90 per cent of Australian women taxpayers, or 5.8 million of them. Labor's efforts are already delivering outcomes for women, with the gender pay gap now at a record low. The publication of gender pay gaps is a critical tool to continue this important work to ultimately achieve gender equality in Australia. If those opposite were serious, they would rebuke Senator Canavan for his comments and they would absolutely make sure that they passed Labor's tax cuts in the Senate today. I remind the minister—I didn't want to interrupt—of standing order 65, about addressing remarks through the chair.","Gender Equality","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat—Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) ","(14:10):"

You'll always have people on this side know that releasing that data is effective. You will only find those on the other side of politics anyone arguing that it's useless.  With the data that's just been released, we now know we have the gender pay gap at its lowest ever level, and overnight we've had the release of the company-by-company data. The days of secretly paying women less than men are now over. That's as a result of particular changes that had been made by law by this government. It's part of a suite of measures aimed at closing the gender pay gap. There was one time in the previous term when there was a sharp fall in the gender pay gap. It was in the November 2020 figure. But it wasn't because women's wages were suddenly rising; it was because lockdowns happened and male wages collapsed. That was the only time that you had a sharp closure of the gender pay gap. The view of this government is that the way to close the gender pay gap is to get wages moving and to look at where there is a disadvantage in feminised industries and change the laws so that those wages move too. The data that's been published shows that 30 per cent of businesses are in the target range, but, for more than 60 per cent of companies, women are still paid more than five per cent less than men. That's why this government has taken the measures that it has. It's why we've banned the pay secrecy clauses. It's why we've expanded access to flexible work arrangements. It's why we now have a positive duty to protect against sexual harassment. It's why we established 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. Every one of these changes deals with participation as well. Every one of these changes corrects a system which has structurally disadvantaged women workers. It should be the case that, when you go to work and you work hard and you get paid, that pay simply reflects the effort you've made and what you have brought to that job. But, as we see with company after company after company, women are still in a situation where that gap, while lower than it has ever been in the history of its being recorded, is still structurally too high. As long as there are those opposite who think that acting on this and publishing this data is somehow useless, we will have a group opposite that has no intention of closing the gender pay gap, which explains why they have opposed each of the laws we brought in to close it.

That means that when they pull out of the petrol station they know that every litre of fuel is going to go further because their vehicles have the most efficient fuel standards in the world.

It's one of Australia's most important patient organisations.  I also want to thank the member for McEwen for this important question, because, as he knows, we did promise for 50 Medicare urgent care clinics to be opened over the course of last year. Instead, we delivered 58. They are open seven days a week with extended hours, are available for walk-ins and, importantly, are fully bulk-billed. We plan to deliver even more this year. Our dear friend and colleague Peta Murphy promised to deliver an urgent care clinic in Frankston—one of a series of commitments that she made and delivered for better health care in her community. Since 30 June, that clinic has delivered more than 12,000 services to the people of Dunkley. More than one in three of those services have been delivered to kids under the age of 15, providing an option for anxious parents who need urgent care for their kids out of hours, on the weekends or simply when they can't get into their normal GP—like Amanda, who wrote to us and said: 'I'm so grateful for this service. I took my two-year-old for review today when I couldn't get an appointment. She was seen straight away. They gave wonderful and timely care for my boy, who is now on the mend.' It's better urgent care when and where people need it, but it's also an option that means people don't have to go to the hospital. More than 60 per cent of patients attending the Frankston clinic say they would otherwise have had to go to the Frankston emergency department, like Paul, who said: 'We really needed attention when most of the GPs were closed for a closed head injury. It kept us from having to visit the Frankston emergency department. Thank you.' That's why, as the member for McEwen points out, our government has worked so closely with states and territories to ensure that these urgent care clinics are located where they'll have the most benefit for hospital systems. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition had a different idea for relieving pressure on our hospital EDs. It wasn't a new model of care. It wasn't a network of new clinics. Instead, he announced in his first budget as health minister that he wanted states to start charging a fee at the emergency department, fitting out all of our triage statements in the 750 public hospitals around Australia with EFTPOS machines. That was his idea of relieving pressure on EDs. It's fit for a man, of course, who wanted to introduce a GP tax as well. We are proud of the legacy Peta Murphy led and the measures that we've put in place to make it easier and cheaper to see your doctor in the electorate of Dunkley. We're determined to protect those measures from this man.","Health Care","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUTLER (Hindmarsh—Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House) ","(14:24):"

These are the same people that said that, frankly, the minimum wage would wreck the economy, tax cuts for all Australians was Marxist economics and a war on hardworking Australians, and the weekend would be over and there'd be no more barbeques for everybody. We all know that what those opposite say is, frankly, demonstrably untrue. Now, of course, we are seeing it again. Instead of making claims that they know are false, those opposite need to explain why they think hardworking Australians should be denied access to cars that are cheaper to run. That is the campaign that those opposite are running. They need to explain why he wants Australians buying a new car to pay more for petrol than they need to.  Again, I want to quote a very auspicious Australian, I will say, on this matter. They're someone who might have known a thing or two about the introduction of fuel efficiency standards. I remind the House that, when this very good member at the time stated they were looking to introduce fuel efficiency standards, this is what they said: … when fuel efficiency standards were introduced in the US, the most popular models before introduction stayed the most popular models after introduction … what we'd call utes … There wasn't a material change in price and we don't expect that there would be a material change in price here. Who said that? That was, of course, the member for Bradfield, when he was introducing the fuel efficiency standards back, I think, in 2018. We know that Australians are missing out on fuel savings because those opposite did not have the courage of their convictions when it came to fuel efficiency standards. Right now Australians are missing out on millions of dollars of fuel savings that they could have saved if this government had actually pursued that. On this side of the House we want Australians to have greater choice of new vehicles and to spend less of their hard-earned cash on fuel.","New Vehicle Efficiency Standard","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[5]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat—Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) ","(14:28):"

"0","1","0","0","1","0","150","Rishworth, Amanda Louise MP","HWA","Kingston","ALP","N/A","1297","I'd like to thank the member for Reid for her question. We visited some such workers just last week in her electorate, and I thank her for sticking up for the workers in her electorate and right across Australia.  The Albanese Labor government is delivering a tax cut for every taxpayer, which will divide meaningful cost-of-living relief for Middle Australia on 1 July this year. Under Labor's tax plan the average Australian worker will get more than double the tax cut they would have received under the previous government's plan. This means workers will have more money in their pocket on 1 July. Indeed, 84 per cent of taxpayers will now receive a bigger tax cut. Some of the workers who will keep more of what they earn because of Labor's tax plan are our social and community service workers. These workers are often the first port of call providing support to some of the most vulnerable people in our community. The support provided by these workers touches the lives of those experiencing poverty, disadvantage and hardship. These are the workers that are delivering our government's escaping-violence program, working day in and out facilitating financial assistance and providing confidential support for people who have recently left a violent intimate partner. These caseworkers deserve to keep more of what they earn. These workers earn approximately $88,000 a year, and under Labor they will receive a tax cut of $1,879. That's $800 more than they would have otherwise received. The Albanese Labor government is committed to supporting our community sector workers. This has been evidenced not just by the bigger, better tax cuts but by our decision to increase indexation and supplementation payments to more than 700 community organisations. These payments are critical to ensure that community service workers get the wage increases they are entitled to. It is clear from our actions that our government want workers to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Those opposite want people to work longer for less, and nothing demonstrates this more clearly than their vocal opposition to our bigger, better tax cuts. Of course, the opposition have called our tax cuts Marxist and an electoral scam. They have made their intention clear in the Senate. The minister will pause. The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order. Mr Fletcher: On relevance: it was in fact a commendably tightly drafted question. There is no basis for the minister to be getting into the territory she's now getting into. I ask the minister to return to her answer. Ms RISHWORTH: This government is putting the tax cuts through the Senate now. Those opposite should not play petty politics. Get out of the way. Support our tax cuts. Support Middle Australia.

The member for Gippsland might want to have a little word in the shell-like ear of our old friend the member for Bradfield, who has dealt with these sorts of scare campaigns in the past and, I must say, very eloquently and very commendably and very efficiently—knocked all the scare campaigns away in his very eloquent op-ed in the Australian, which is still on his website as we speak, today.

Food manufacturing is the single biggest sector of Australian manufacturing, directly employing nearly 200,000 Australians and providing huge value-add to our agricultural sector. It's the economic and industrial lifeblood for many regional towns and outer suburban communities, and a vital part of our growing manufacturing sector that now employs more than 930,000 Australians.  Over 85,000 new jobs were added to the sector compared to when those opposite were last in government. Forty per cent of employees in food manufacturing are women, and we're supporting manufacturing workers by helping them to earn more across the manufacturing industry. Workers are earning $144 more per week on our watch, and Labor's tax cuts will mean the average food and beverage manufacturing worker will get a tax cut of $1,206. It's clear: earn more and keep more on this side; work longer for less on that side. That is the big difference. I'm asked whether the facts about the impacts of what we are doing are being disputed and the answer is: absolutely, yes. We've seen the mindless obstructive negativity of those opposite. When we wanted to invest in manufacturing capability, they voted against the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund. When we want to shield manufacturers from the worst of the energy price rises, they vote against our energy price relief. They're only interested in talking about manufacturing if they can talk it down. Surprisingly, it's the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who wrote an op-ed in the Australian calling a manufacturing sector a 'graveyard' and also goes on to say—and it didn't stop—'littered with the bodies of once great companies claiming that the rate of insolvencies was higher than it's ever been'. It's just a futile attempt because, when those claims have been examined independently, they're not supported by fact. It's not the only doozy.

She points out, though, a very important commitment made by the former that we have committed to continuing. That is the establishment of a Head to Health centre in Mount Barker in the Adelaide Hills.  The Head to Health service is a new model here in Australia. It, like the urgent care clinics, is a walk-in service; you don't need to make an appointment. It's fully bulk billed, so fully free of charge. It is designed to provide a service for people who need urgent mental health support. That might be a person experiencing very real distress, who needs some support in the immediate sense and then a referral, perhaps, to another service or back to their usual practitioner, or people with more severe and complex mental illness, for whom there are limited services—I think members across this chamber would agree—right now. We're establishing a network of 61, including five services in South Australia. Two are currently open: one in the centre of Adelaide and one in the member for Barker's electorate in Mount Gambier. And three of them will be opened over the course of this year: one in Mount Banker in the Adelaide Hills, one in northern Adelaide and one in Port Pirie in the member for Grey's electorate. I'm advised that the tender was completed by Country SA Primary Health Network, the PHN, that covers, I think, the entirety of the member for Mayo's electorate. That tender was closed at the end of last year, and the intention is to have that service operating by mid to late 2024.","Mayo Electorate: Health Care","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[3]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUTLER (Hindmarsh—Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House) ","(14:44):"

We do know that some people are doing it particularly tough at the moment, which is why we're working to deliver real assistance to help ease cost-of-living pressures for Australians.  Through our plans to boost wages and our new tax cuts, we want Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. Come 1 July, every Australian taxpayer will receive a tax cut. That's 13.6 million Australians getting a tax cut. The vast majority will be getting a bigger tax cut under Labor's plan. We also have a plan to help Australians who want to buy their first home or buy a home. Our Help to Buy shared-equity program will be life changing for tens of thousands of Australians. It will provide a pathway to homeownership for people who have been locked out. It is targeted and aimed at low- and middle-income earners deliberately because we know that many renters could service a mortgage, but they can't get the deposit. Help to Buy will help these low- and middle-income Australians get over the hurdle of a deposit and enjoy ongoing savings thanks to smaller repayments. Eligible participants will only need a two per cent deposit for the program. The government will then support them with an equity stake of up to 30 per cent for existing homes or 40 per cent for new homes. We know that Help to Buy will be critical for many Australians, because we have heard from them about what this will mean. Like Chris from Canberra, who said, 'Without Help to Buy he would not be able to afford a property for many years.' And like Gemma from Sydney, who said, 'Help to Buy would completely reorientate my life.' And then there's Stephen from Brisbane—I'm not sure if it's the member over there. I doubt it. He said that he has enough savings to buy through shared equity but not without this help from the government. These are real people who need this real assistance to get into homeownership. But what do we have? We have those opposite and those over here who are blocking this. Those opposite and their friends in the Greens are teaming up again to again stop Australians from getting into housing.

"0","1","0","0","1","0","256","Bowen, Chris MP","DZS","McMahon","ALP","N/A","1301","I again very much welcome the question and the chance to correct the misinformation being put by those opposite. The member for Flinders would be interested to know that her average constituent drives 18,911 kilometres a year and would save $1,503 in fuel costs if they had access to more efficient cars. The member for Flinders might want to explain to her constituents why she is against more choice for them.  This is the latest example in a long line of misinformation we have had. We have had the continual claims from those opposite about car prices. The analysis released by the minister for transport and I made very clear that in no country that has introduced vehicle efficiency standards have increases in the price of cars resulted from that policy. The member for Bradfield agrees with that. He said it himself on many occasions when he was very eloquently putting the case. This is just the latest example of misinformation. We saw the Leader of the Opposition last week talking about the current situation— Mr Taylor: You're the master of misleading! I have been very generous with the member for Hume and explained to him in quite a lot of detail about his interjections and being warned. He will leave the chamber under 94 (a). This is not how question time will operate. The minister will be heard in silence. The member for Hume then left the chamber. Mr BOWEN: The Leader of the Opposition said last week, on 9 February: Now, we have some of the highest efficiency standards in the world in terms of our vehicles … There are a couple of small problems with that statement. You could argue about whether they were the highest or the lowest if they existed, but the fact of the matter is Australia doesn't have any fuel efficiency standards—a point that was made by the member for Bradfield in his op-ed in the Australian when he said: Eighty per cent of the global vehicle passenger fleet is subject to fuel efficiency standards, but Australia has none. We've seen other examples. A man who's received a bit of attention in question time today, Senator Canavan—this is not the most outrageous thing he said, but it's pretty outrageous—said the government of Australia has decided to introduce the world's most aggressive emissions limits on vehicles here in Australia. This is clear misinformation when you consider, I confess to the House, the standards that the minister for transport and I are consulting on proposing are less ambitious than those that exist in Europe, New Zealand and other key markets. We have carefully designed them to deliver benefits to the Australian people: $140 billion in benefits to all Australians between now and 2050; $12 billion in fuel savings for motorists by 2030—the average new car buyer in 2028 will cut their annual fuel cost by around a thousand dollars—and health benefits, which is why this policy has been welcomed by the Australian Medical Association, as well as by the peak motoring groups such as the NRMA, and has been called for by the RACQ and RAC WA and welcomed by Hyundai, Volkswagen, BMW, Kia and Volvo, to name a few. This is what good policy looks like: careful consultation over a 12-month period, taking many submissions and putting Australian motorists first. Meanwhile, those opposite put Australian motorists last—equal with the motorists in Russia, where the Leader of the Opposition wants to align his policies.","New Vehicle Efficiency Standard","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[5]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BOWEN (McMahon—Minister for Climate Change and Energy) ","(14:52):"

One of the things that the report recommends is financial support for teaching and nursing students when they're doing their prac. It makes the point that if you're a nursing student you're spending 800 hours working in a hospital where you're not paid. If you're a teaching student, you're spending about 600 hours in a classroom where you're not paid. To do these pracs you're often having to move or travel long distances and sometimes you may have to give up your part-time job. A lot of us in this place know how important those part-time jobs are when you're at university. Working at Sizzler helped get me through university. The Prime Minister worked at Pancakes on the Rocks when he was at university—am I right? Mr Albanese: Indeed.

A lot of us, all across the chamber, have stories like that. You, Member for Dickson, worked in a butcher shop, didn't you?

In my home state of Tasmania in 2023, 81.1 per cent of vehicle sales were either SUVs, light commercial vehicles or utes. The top selling cars were the HiLux, Ford Ranger and the MG MG3. Industry analysis shows that they would attract penalties of $14,000, $17,000 and $11,000, respectively.

Perhaps the honourable member is a little bit embarrassed about opposing a policy which would save his constituents $1,009 a year in petrol costs by giving them a choice of better cars in this country.  Now, the honourable member in the question that was written for him, has mischaracterised, of course, the policy design that has been put forward and consulted upon by the minister for transport and I. I'm a little surprised the question got through tactics because the chair of the tactics committee is the member for Bradfield. The House will be shocked to learn that he has views about this matter and about the availability of utes in countries with fuel efficiency standards. He pointed out, for example: So when fuel efficiency standards were introduced in the US, the most popular models before introduction stayed the most popular models after introduction. Essentially, what Americans call pickup trucks and what we'd call utes, like the Chevy Silverado. There wasn't a material change in price and we don't expect that there would be a material change in price here. What the honourable member and those opposite are seeking to convince the Australian people of is that Australia will be the only country in the world where we introduce efficiency standards and the price of vehicles go up as a result. It didn't happen in the United States in 1975, Japan in 1985, China in 2005, South Korea in 2006, the European Union in 2009, Canada in 2011, Mexico in 2013, India in 2014, or, I think the Prime Minister's personal favourite, Saudi Arabia in 2016.

The average constituent of the member for Durack drives 23,154 kilometres a year and would save $1,841 a year by having more efficient vehicles from 2028 onwards. The member refers to Western Australia. Perhaps those sorts of savings are why the RAC WA—the peak motoring group in Western Australia that actually represents the interests of motorists, drivers and consumers—called on the government to introduce 'a mandatory impactful national FES', 'aligning Australia with the rest of the developed world' as a top priority. That's exactly what we're doing. We're aligning Australia with the rest of the developed world to give Australians the same access to fuel-efficient vehicles that those in the United States, Europe, New Zealand, China and India have.

The Leader of the Opposition knows that, and he says, 'nyet'. 'No, we're not having that. Nyet! We're going to stick out there with Russia as the only developed major economy without access to fuel efficiency standards.' Well, that's not good enough, as far as we're concerned. It might be good enough for the Leader of the Opposition, who has no plan for motorists to get access to more efficient vehicles and no plans of his own, despite the fact that, to their credit, the member for Bradfield and the then member for Kooyong tried to implement this policy in 2017. They went to the then shadow minister for transport, who is now the Prime Minister of Australia, and said, 'Look, this is going to be controversial, but will we have opposition support?' The then shadow minister for transport said, 'Yes, you will, because it's good policy.' We will back good policy, because that's what leadership looks like. It's seeing a good idea that might not be your idea and backing it. That's what the now Prime Minister did, and he is now the Prime Minister of Australia.

There's just a second-hand scare campaign running on empty and the warmed-up leftovers of governments past. To those opposite, a car is nothing more than a scare campaign on wheels. We've seen it with utes. We saw it when, in the 2019 campaign, they said that electric vehicles would end the weekend.  Fuel standards are about giving Australians more choice of the latest vehicles that are cleaner and cheaper to run. That is why we offered bipartisan support when the Liberal Party, under that minister, wanted to introduce fuel efficiency standards. Every other developed country in the world has fuel efficiency standards except one: Russia. The Leader of the Opposition can line up with Vladimir Putin. I'll line up with the United States and the rest of the developed world. Russia is a country as famous for the quality of its cars as it is for the quality of its democracy. But this bloke thinks it's okay. He was down there in Dunkley at the used-car yard happy to stand up and try to sell the Morrison scare campaign from back in 2019. The Leader of the Opposition's used-car model is noisy, unreliable and only turns right. It only works in reverse and won't ever go forward. It only goes backwards. It won't drive in Melbourne at night—you've got to remember all of those migrants. And it's made entirely of glass. It's a bit of a bold design move from this guy. Like the bulldozer from Cook, who has left, it's designed to wreck, not to build. What we're doing is building a stronger economy. What we're doing is saving Australians money. What we're doing is boosting their wages. What we're doing is cutting their taxes. What we're doing is building in new efficiencies—not being afraid of the future but shaping the future. If you don't, the future sorts you out. The fact is that you can't just pretend that this is not happening. When I was transport minister as far back as in 2008, there was research being done on an internal combustion engine. It was all about future vehicles that are cheaper to run and are more efficient, which is what our policy is about. I table the media release from today 'Toyota launches all-new bZ4X BEV' about a new SUV being launched by Toyota, and on that note I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.","New Vehicle Efficiency Standard","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[12]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(15:25):"

On 7 December last year the Parliamentary Friends of Asbestos Related Disease acknowledged this historic anniversary. The anniversary was an important occasion to acknowledge the many people who work tirelessly to raise awareness of asbestos related disease. While every effort was made to acknowledge these wonderful people, the key advocacy group from Western Australia, the Asbestos Diseases Society of Australia, the ADSA, was missed. So I wish to make amendments now.  For decades the ADSA has been fighting for the rights of asbestos victims, including people who worked at the infamous mine in Wittenoom and the people who lived in that town. The ADSA pioneered groundbreaking legal action and worked closely with stakeholders, including trade unions, to raise public awareness of asbestos risks and look after the injured. As Ms Laurie Kazan-Allen rightly highlighted in his email to me, it was a glaring omission not to acknowledge the ADSA in the 20-year commemoration. So today I rise to thank them for their incredible work over many years.","National Ban on the Use of Asbestos: 20th Anniversary","STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BROADBENT (Monash) ","(15:28):"

"0","0","0","1","1","0","382","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I have received a letter from the honourable member for Deakin proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely:  This Government's bad decisions and wrong priorities driving up the cost of living for Australians. I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places— It's very clear—and if there was any doubt before question time there's no doubt now—that this government's terrible decisions are driving up the cost of living for Australians. There seems to be a parallel universe because the members of the government, from the Prime Minister down, seem to be telling Australians that they've never had it better. They come in here with smiles on their faces, and they're very self-satisfied, very pleased with themselves—the Prime Minister seems very pleased with himself—which just shows how disconnected the modern Labor Party is from Australians who are doing so terribly tough out there. For many Australians, it wouldn't be a surprise that the Prime Minister is so disconnected from what is occurring out there because this is a man, quite frankly, who, between Taylor Swift concerts and Katy Perry concerts at billionaire's homes, we wouldn't expect to have the time or bandwidth to focus on what Australians are going through. We heard before the election that the Prime Minister would make life easier for Australians, and the truth, the sad truth, is that, 20 months after the election of the Albanese government, Australians are poorer. There's no simpler way to put it than that. Australians are now poorer because of the decisions of this government. You'd think that members opposite, anyone connected to their electorate, would hang their head in shame rather than come in here looking very self-satisfied, as they do, talking about tax cuts that won't start until 1 July, while there are people now $8,000 a year on average worse off. That doesn't even account for the millions of Australians with a mortgage. If you're an Australian with a mortgage, you're not $8,000 a year worse off; you're $24,000 a year worse off. Under this government we've seen rents increase by 26 per cent. We see first homebuyers at their lowest levels for over a decade. We see new home starts at their lowest levels for over a decade. We see approvals at their lowest levels for over a decade. What that means is, if Australians thought Labor's housing crisis in 2023 was bad, Labor's housing crisis in 2024 and 2025 is going to be even worse. I'll come back to housing, but, in the time that the Prime Minister has been jetting around feeling very satisfied—there's no celebrity that can come to Australia without the Prime Minister mobbing them in some way, shape or form. There's no celebrity that's safe in this country. There is no celebrity or international pop star that can fly into Australia and fly out without being mobbed by our Prime Minister. In that time, when the Prime Minister said he would reduce energy prices for the average Australian by $275, what's actually happened? Electricity is up by 20 per cent. Gas is up by 27 per cent. How on earth is every member opposite going to explain to their electorate when people quite rightly ask, 'Where on earth is my $275 reduction?' Not only have we not seen reductions, but we've seen increases. I think the disconnect between the government and what Australians are facing is the most concerning thing here, because Australians' faith in this place has got worse since this government has been in power. You can understand why, when they look at members opposite walking into question time every day and basically telling Australians, 'You've never had it better,' and that the government deserves a pat on the back; they would feel as though they're being gaslit. Most Australians would think, 'What parallel universe do these people live in?' Then we see a policy from this government to smash the vast majority of Australians who purchase new cars in this country with its new tax on family cars. Who on earth would think in this economic environment that of all the priorities—'What do Australians need desperately?'—we need a new tax on family cars? And it's a new tax on the most popular family cars in this country. I'm sure the Prime Minister really wasn't planning on finishing question time talking about their new tax on family cars, but it's pretty clear that the Prime Minister needed to mop up after the member for McMahon. I'm sure he didn't want to be doing that, but what he didn't do in that answer was tell Australians and level with Australians on the costs that Labor's tax on family cars will impose. Here we've got what I think are very conservative and very generous estimates to the government of what the impact of their tax on family cars will be. They include an additional $11,020 for a Toyota RAV4; a $12,180 increase for an MG ZS; a $25,000 increase for a Toyota LandCruiser; a $17,950 increase for one of the most popular new cars in this country, a Ford Ranger; a $14,490 increase for a Toyota HiLux; and a $13,830 increase—a tax on Australian families—for an Isuzu D-Max. What does it say about the priorities of this government that at this time—when the average household is $8,000 a year worse off; when the average household with a mortgage is $24,000 a year worse off; and when they've seen an increase in their rent of 26 per cent, an increase in their food of 10 per cent, an increase on their electricity of 20 per cent and an increase on their gas of 27 per cent—that the solution to those problems is yet another tax on the family car? In the list of twisted priorities seen in my time in this place, I'm yet to see something as extraordinary as this. We have a housing crisis that is unprecedented in this country, with a hapless housing minister with no idea and no plan, sitting in her office with absolutely no clue of what to do. So what pitiful thing does the government bring to this chamber? They bring their Help to Buy scheme or, as it's known more colloquially in the community, 'the forced-to-sell scheme'—a shared-equity scheme from this government that I suspect many people would question at its face: who really wants to co-own a home with this Prime Minister and this housing minister? Putting that aside for one moment, which genius could come up with an idea to create 10,000 shared-equity places when there are already schemes throughout the country that are not being used because nobody wants these products? In fact, in New South Wales you might ask, 'How many places are left out of their scheme?' For the New South Wales shared-equity scheme, on which the government's Help to Buy scheme is based, how many places are left? Is it 10 per cent of places left? Is it 15 per cent or 20 per cent? No, that would be far too generous to this government. It is 94 per cent of places left. So I imagine there are thousands of these products available. Australians do not want them, for a range of reasons, including that if your income goes above a certain level you can be forced to sell your home. So you come home really happy and excited to tell your partner and family you have had a pay rise, but, if that pay rise takes you above the income threshold, the government can sell the house from underneath you. No wonder there are 94 per cent of these places left in the New South Wales scheme and places left in the Victorian scheme, the South Australian scheme and the Western Australian scheme. Why on earth would that be a priority for this government? It just shows that they do not understand the pressures and cost-of-living crisis faced by Australians. (Time expired) Thank you so much to the opposition for the opportunity to discuss the priorities of the government and what we are doing to provide real support for Australians on the cost of living. We just heard a whole lot of drivel from the opposite side. We know that the cost of living is biting into household budgets. That is in no small part due to 10 years of complete policy ineptitude and inaction by the previous government—10 years of keeping wages deliberately low, 10 years of policies that saw people with languishing wages, 10 years of a climate change policy debacle and 10 years of allowing energy costs to run out of control. We are a government that listens. We have made every policymaking moment count. Relieving the cost of living without raising inflation has been our No. 1 priority. Those opposite's policies? Nothing. Nada. Zip. They are a policy void. They've voted against every good policy we have put forward to manage the cost of living. They have done absolutely nothing to support this government in helping households manage their budgets. What they have done is scaremonger and discredit good policy. Today we saw an important report that showed how stark the gender pay gap is. The gender pay gap matters. It matters to women; it matters to families. We know the gender pay gap costs the Australian economy $51.8 billion a year. We know that 62 per cent of private employer gender pay gaps are now over five per cent in favour of men earning more, and 50 per cent of all employers have a gender pay gap of over 9.1 per cent. In the context of cost-of-living pressures, this means that women are essentially bringing home 80c to 90c for every dollar that a male worker brings to the supermarket or has in his bank account to pay the bills. Let me be incredibly clear. The pay gap matters when it comes to cost-of-living pressures. It matters for single mothers looking after their kids. It matters for young women working in cafes and paying rent. It matters for families paying a mortgage and relying on dual incomes. So when a particular senator today has said that today's release of the national gender pay gap material is 'useless data that breeds resentment and division' I believe we need to pause and unpack what this means. This points to a person and an alternative government that do not care about the pay that 50 per cent of Australians bring home. It points to a mentality, an ideology, that would rather see women doing the ironing, as a well-known former prime minister said, than earning money and supporting their families. The senator seemed to say the silent bit, the bit that regressive misogynists think but never actually say. And the world shudders when they do say it. It's like when the previous prime minister said women were lucky not to get shot for protesting against that government's complete lack of empathy and effective policies for women. This gives us an insight into the dangerous and sexist agenda of the alternative government. This is a shambolic group of people who, in the simplest terms, don't care about the financial pressure that Australians are feeling. They don't care about increasing the real wages of Australians. In fact, we know it was their policy to deliberately keep wages low. They don't care about looking after people. They don't care about bringing down the cost of living for Australians, and they vote against every single measure this government puts forward. They would rather run scare campaigns and not upset the apple cart that is gender inequality. They're a group of people uninterested in workers, in women and in the real worries and pressures on Australians. Let me assure you: Labor is a government that listens. And we don't just listen; we act on what we hear. That's why our No. 1 priority is addressing inflation and the cost-of-living challenges. It's why the Prime Minister has announced that, come 1 July, Labor will deliver a tax cut for every single Australian. That's 13.6 million people with more take-home pay in their pockets—from teachers to nurses, from truckies to cleaners, from hospo workers to childcare educators. If you're a uni or TAFE student who has a part-time job and rents, you'll benefit. If you're a working parent who feels the pinch of rising costs, you'll be better off. If you're nearing retirement and working part time, you'll have more money in your pocket. If your name is Sue and you work in construction, you will benefit. If you went to Taylor Swift and you love your mum, and you work three days a week as a receptionist, you will benefit. Every single Australian will be better off under Labor. That's more cost-of-living relief for lower-income and middle-income Australians. But this builds on an additional $23 billion in targeted relief—targeted relief that the opposition has opposed every step of the way. This includes making medicines cheaper by allowing people to buy two scripts for the cost of one, making it easier and cheaper to see a doctor by making the biggest investment in bulk-billing in Medicare's history; providing energy bill relief through rebates and capping the prices of coal and gas; making child care cheaper and expanding paid parental leave; building more social and affordable homes; and making the biggest increase in rent assistance in 30 years. We've done all this while delivering the first budget surplus in 15 years, taking stronger action on climate change and creating a record number of jobs, not to mention overseeing significant wage rises. I want to be clear. We know the pressure that households are under when it comes to rising rent and mortgage repayments. I know in my electorate of Cooper there are share houses that are selling their couches on Marketplace, as people have to move back into their parents' houses when they get a rental increase of $1,000 a month. A whole generation of young people feel like homeownership is out of reach for them for the rest of their lives. It's clear that only Labor can be trusted to help more Australians into homes that they own. We've helped more than 100,000 people across the country into homeownership since the election. Help to Buy will bring homeownership back into reach for tens of thousands of Australians, but the Greens and Liberals are now standing in the way of this vital new assistance—again. And why? Because—it's no great surprise—they're more interested in painting the picture of a crisis than being part of a solution. They're willing to make political sport of the financial misery of people doing it tough. We're doing everything we can to boost the supply of affordable homes through the Housing Australia Future Fund. We know people want to live close by to the jobs and opportunities we're creating in communities right across the country. Through the National Housing Accord Facility we have an ambitious target to partner with the states and territories to build 1.2 million homes over five years. I feel like a mum teaching kids to share and play nicely when I say we need everyone to work together and put their petty political agendas to the side. We need to work across all levels of government, across all parties, to reach across the corridor and engage with the private sector in order to fast-track development and get more Australians into more homes. We know Australians feel under pressure from the cost of running their cars and crippled by the lack of meaningful choices we have in Australia. That's why we're giving Australians more choice of cars that are both cleaner and cheaper to run, through our new vehicle efficiency standard. This is good for household budgets, and it's good for the environment. Right now, 85 per cent of the global car market operates under a standard, and Australia is in poor company. We join Russia as one of the only developed countries that don't have efficiency standards. The United States has had a policy in place for 50 years. Historically Australians have only been able to choose from a limited range of cars and a limited range of manufacturers. Under Labor, this list will grow and expand to have new options: new hybrid cars, more electric vehicles and more zero-emission cars. I'd like to wrap up by returning to my first point: we are hearing the difficulties people are feeling right now. We know that Australians deserve roofs over their heads and food on the table and that they need these to be affordable. This is our priority, this is what Labor governments care about and this is what Labor governments deliver. I rise to speak on the Albanese Labor government's misguided priorities for Australia. Mallee voters don't buy Labor's song-and-dance routine that they are the party of tax cuts. Stages one, two and three income tax cuts were under the coalition's policy. On stage three, Labor told us 100 times they would back them in. Then we are told to believe the Prime Minster had some 'road to Damascus' insight—an epiphany to shift the narrative on tax cuts. Voters remember governments that break their promises, and these governments are consequently found to be untrustworthy. We on this side will be reminding voters. Another area of massive destruction of this Albanese Labor government is on the reckless rush to renewables: 82 per cent by 2030. Mallee is ground zero for this rollout, with wind-turbine cowboys stirring bad blood in my regional communities, pitting mate against mate and farmer against farmer with secret deals that never come to fruition. But the bad blood will remain. The Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner, Andrew Dyer, has called out this deplorable behaviour in his report on energy; the energy proponents botched community consultation. From local experience in Mallee, I can tell you: that report is the tip of the iceberg. This cowboy energy sector needs regulation, and the Nationals are working closely on ensuring regional communities have a voice and on ensuring that social licence is secured fair and square, not through proponents' underhanded behaviour, with handouts here and there, but through genuine approval from communities. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, doesn't care, just like he doesn't care whether the residents of Mallee and their fellow Australians will ever see their $275 energy bill relief. Energy bill relief will be another broken promise, because only the mother of all subsidy programs could see, in net terms, that $275 reduction be delivered under energy bill hikes on Labor's watch. But Labor aren't done hiking the cost of living for regional Australians; their family car tax, dressed up as a fuel emissions standard, is a cruel initiative that will rob regional Peter to pay inner-city Paul. Paul will be there, showing off his new electric vehicle on Lygon Street subsidised by the government, but Mallee residents like Peter will have no choice but to pay up to $25,000 more for their family car just so Paul can feel pious that he's supposedly saving the planet. Labor's family car tax is designed to halt inner-city Labor seats from falling into Greens hands; make no mistake. Those are the seats with the highest EV take-up, and I won't let Labor pretend regional Australians will catch up with their city cousins on EV ownership. Take Toorak, for instance, in Melbourne, where they have 24 times the EV take-up than either of the largest centres in my electorate, Mildura and Horsham. One Mallee car dealer told me that the push for electric vehicles was impractical in regional areas, saying, 'We lack the infrastructure of public charging stations.' This dealer told me there are issues with EV longevity and resale value, with some American dealers reducing sale prices by more than $5,000 as EV prices nosedive when they need new batteries. Battery replacement costs are so high that replacing an EV makes better sense than replacing a battery. Perversely, Mallee residents will pay extra when buying their SUV or family farm vehicle under Minister Bowen's plans to pay for EV subsidies. I spoke confidentially to one dealer last week who faces laying off a quarter of his 40-strong workforce due to the impact of Labor's family car tax. Dr Charlton: Absolute garbage! Dr WEBSTER: You can say 'garbage' all you like, sir. The reality is these are the dealerships—through you, Deputy Speaker Claydon. Manufacturers are being monstered by the minister, and I hope that all comes out in the wash very soon. We all want to see lower emissions and more efficient cars, but Labor's city-centric spots are on full display. Yet again Labor robs the regions to secure votes in the cities.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","The SPEAKER ","(15:30):"

"0","0","0","1","1","0","385","Charlton, Andrew MP","I8M","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I must say that the irony of standing up to talk on an MPI about bad decisions made while in government brought on by those opposite is certainly not lost on me today. So much of what our government is dealing with is a result of nearly a decade of bad decisions by those opposite. In the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments, we had times of drift, denial and delay from those opposite, yet they come in here today and bring on this MPI. Those people over there spent nearly a decade in chaos, focused on each other and their own internal leadership problems. There was nearly a decade of climate denial and inaction on one of the most pressing problems our country and, indeed, the world is facing. There was nearly a decade where they did nothing to reduce cost-of-living pressures. Certainly, reducing cost-of-living pressures for Australians was not at all the focus of those over there when they were in government.  In fact, we can look at their record. Under the Turnbull government, they made the decision to support cuts to penalty rates to reduce the take-home pay of workers. From those opposite we had the thought bubble around wanting to increase the pension age to 70. If that had happened, that would have taken the Australian pension age to one of the highest in the developed world. We had, of course, the admission from those opposite when they were in government that low wages were in fact a deliberate design feature of the economy they ran. That's right! Under a Liberal and National government, it was a design feature for Australians to own less. Yet they come in here and talk about bad decisions from this government. This government is doing all it can to put a laser-like focus on addressing the very real cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing. Today we have had highlighted another topical area of neglect that we saw from those opposite: their lack of support for women and their lack of efforts to close the gender pay gap in this country. As a result of the actions of our government, today we've seen, for the first time, the publication of gender pay gaps for nearly 5,000 private-sector employers in this country. This is a pivotal step in transparency and accountability in addressing gender inequality. It wasn't done by those opposite. They were not interested in doing this work of helping Australian women to earn more, helping Australian families to be supported because women in those families are earning more. Those opposite did not care about that challenge when they were in government, and it seems they do not care about it now that they are in opposition. Today we have Senator Canavan saying the gender pay gap report is 'useless data' because it doesn't even correct for basic differences like hours worked. The gender pay gap report is now the 'annual Andrew Tate recruitment drive'; it just breeds recruitment and division—that's the view of those opposite on the efforts to close the gender pay gap in the country. I have not yet heard the Leader of the Opposition say that he does not agree with Senator Canavan on that. That is incredibly disappointing because, as I said, what helps Australian families with the cost of living is Australian women earning more, Australian women having more in their pay cheques, and that is exactly what this government is trying to do. Under this government Australian women are earning more. Wages are going up. Under this government Australian women will get a tax cut. Every single Australian taxpayer is getting a tax cut under this government. Again, look at the industries that women work in—nurses, teachers. People earning $75,000 a year are getting a tax cut that's more than double what they would have got under those opposite. Those opposite didn't want people earning $45,000 or less to get a tax cut—people like sales assistants and receptionists. Our government is delivering them a tax cut. We are doing the work that those opposite failed to do, with their bad decisions over nearly a decade in government. We know that Australians need cost-of-living relief and we continue to focus on that through our tax cuts, through our support for health and, importantly, through our work to close the gender pay gap, ensuring that Australian women get to earn what they should and keep more of what they earn.  The MPI is always a nice occasion to sit and listen to those opposite. I like to make sure I'm here for the whole debate, because you get some interesting insights. The member for Jagajaga just summed up quite nicely the challenges this government faces. With five minutes to talk about being in government for 20 months and outline the amazing achievements of the Albanese government, the member for Jagajaga spent four minutes talking about the opposition, talking about our side of this chamber. They're in government; they've got the ability to make decisions. The one minute she did talk about what they've achieved—we're talking about $15 a week in five months for the Australian people. That really sums up this Albanese government.  The Australian public know and we know that, for all of last year and all of 2022, those opposite were distracted. The terms 'cost of living' and 'Middle Australia' were not used by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer. They've used the terms a lot in the last six weeks, since Christmas, but just using a word does not mean you're actually delivering for the Australian people. The Australian people know that. We get a little bit of frustration on the other side when we're talking about a car tax that's going to add up to $25,000 to the cost of a ute. There are a lot of tradies in Casey that are worried about this tax, and what do we get from the minister? The minister references the United States fuel efficiency system, but he leaves out a bit of the detail about some important differences. I'm going to quote from one industry figure: 'I don't think anybody would be opposed to us copying what they have in the USA, but what they've proposed looks like nothing like what they have in the USA.' What is this industry source talking about? In the US model, there is an exemption for certain vehicles. If a vehicle is over 3.86 metric tonnes, it is exempt from the fuel efficiency standard. Perversely, in the real world, that's one of the reasons that you see so many large vehicles in the United States. Manufacturers are making sure that they get above that 3.86 metric tonnes. So what's the proposal from this government in Australia? They are looking at a 4.5 metric tonne exemption. I'll let the Australian people in on a little secret about why they put it up to 4.5 metric tonnes. It's to get all the utes that the tradies of Casey need for towing their work trailers, and it's to get the family SUVs that you need in my electorate to make sure you can fit the pram in to take your children to school and to sport, because public transport isn't readily available in an electorate like mine. That is a core and fundamental difference. Every time the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy stand up and reference the United States fuel efficiency system, either they are willingly misleading the Australian people or they're not across the detail of what's involved in their own policy. It's one or the other, because that significant change is in their policy. And that sums up the Albanese Labor government. It's all about the headline; it's not about the detail. But the detail matters. That's why this will drive costs up. That's why it's not relevant to compare the US model. We know that this Prime Minister does not understand the challenges of the Australian people. The biggest question he has to work out is: what is he going to wear to Taylor Swift, and how does he make sure it doesn't double up when he goes to see Katy Perry at Raheen? That's the toughest decision this Prime Minister made on the weekend—the change in outfit from Taylor Swift to Katy Perry—because that's what he thinks about. He has been in this place since 1996. It revolves around the actions of parliament, and he is making sure he enjoys the trappings of the role for as long as he can. But that does not solve the cost-of-living crisis that the people of Casey and the people of Australia are facing today. Since the election of the Albanese government, there has been a single focus of this government: how to support working families and those worse off. As a representative of the people of Holt, it is my duty to advocate for policies that alleviate the burdens faced by families struggling to make ends meet, particularly in the outer south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, where my electorate is located and where the challenges are keenly felt.  In my electorate of Holt, like many electorates in the outer suburbs, families are grappling with the relentless rise in essential expenses, such as housing, child care, health care and utilities. These pressures weigh heavily on the shoulders of everyday Australians, straining their budgets and limiting their opportunities for financial security and prosperity. This is why I am proud to be a part of a government with a plan—a plan to tackle this cost-of-living crisis. At the heart of this plan lies the implementation of cost-of-living tax cuts aimed at providing immediate relief to hardworking Australians, especially in those electorates like Holt and Dunkley. Under our plan every single Australian taxpayer will receive a tax cut, regardless of their income—11.5 million Australians will receive a bigger tax cut than under the Liberals' plan. This tax cut, one that the coalition had to be dragged to support, will provide more relief to 90 per cent of Australians, especially those earning under $45,000 a year. How can the Liberals lecture us on priorities while the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is running around on national TV stating that her party will unwind tax cuts for every taxpayer? I guess the people who stack the shelves at Woolies, like my former colleagues, or those who cook our Friday night takeaway are not a priority for the Liberal Party. In Holt, where families are feeling the pinch of skyrocketing living expenses, these tax cuts will make a tangible difference. For instance, a minimum wage worker on $45,000 a year will be $800 better off under Labor's plan. These tax cuts will extend to truck drivers, IT workers, nurses and teachers, like my sister-in-law Christine. With the average tax cut for residents of Holt being a substantial $1,321, these changes will bring significant relief to families. Our priorities go beyond just tax cuts. Labor's 10-point plan includes a range of initiatives aimed at tackling the root causes of the cost-of-living crisis. This is a $23 billion package to support working families. This package includes our priority for energy relief, a priority the Liberals have voted against. This includes our priority for cheaper medicines, again a priority the Liberals voted against. This includes our priority to get wages moving again, a priority the Liberal Party consistently votes against. When it comes to the cost of living, the Liberals always say no. We understand that true prosperity requires a holistic plan that addresses the cost-of-living pressures. This is why our plan encompasses measures to create jobs and boost wages. Getting people into work and giving them a pay rise is the No. 1 way to tackle the cost of living for families. Over 650,000 new jobs have been created since Labor came into government and, last year, Labor delivered the highest annual wage growth since 2009. We have got wages moving again for the first time since 2018. After a decade of Liberal policies that suppressed wages and wanted people to work longer for less, Labor's priority is very clear. We are committed to fighting tirelessly for policies that put the interests of working families in electorates like Holt and Dunkley first. It's wonderful to see schoolchildren above us watching this debate. We have just heard from the member for Holt, and can I say something nice about the member? The member migrated to Australia when she was 11. She got a job at Woolworths and worked there for 15 years. I think the perspective that she brings to a debate like this is one that means her contribution comes from a well-meaning place even if I don't agree with everything she says. I too arrived in Australia when I was 10, and I am grateful for my work experience at McDonald's.  I want to say something about aspiration. We have heard a lot this week and in this debate about quotes from pop stars, and Taylor Swift is No. 1. The outgoing member for Cook did a very good job of quoting Taylor Swift. But I want to say something about another pop star, a country music star. His name is Jason DeFord, also known as 'Jelly Roll'. In November last year at Nashville, Jelly Roll won new artist of the year at 39 years of age. He gave a great speech. He said there was something poetic about him winning new artist of the year at that age. He said he wanted to say something to people who were struggling. He said, 'I don't know where you're at in life or what you're going through, but I want to tell you to keep going.' He said: 'I want to tell you success is on the other side of it. I want to tell you it's going to be okay. I want to tell you that the windshield is bigger than the rear-view mirror for a reason.' He said, 'It's because what's in front of you is so much more important than what's behind you.' In debates like this, we hear again and again the Labor members stand up and go straight to the rear-view mirror and not look through the windshield that Australians are looking through right now. What is through that windshield? This is what they see. Food is up nine per cent, housing is up 12 per cent, electricity is up 20 per cent, insurance is up 22 per cent and gas is up 27 per cent. In my home city of Melbourne, many young families are giving up on the aspiration of homeownership. If you take the median household income and look at the median house price, that family can afford none of the houses available in the 354 suburbs of Melbourne. None. If you lower their expectations to look at what a medium-earning household can afford, for units it's 15 out of 354 suburbs. If we take the windshield metaphor, Australians are looking through a cracked windshield, the wipers aren't working and it's raining. While the Labor Party focuses on this side and the previous government, the Labor Party needs to turn its mind to the fact that it is now in government and it can do something about what Australians are seeing in front of them right now. We have seen lots of press releases about the great gift that is coming from the stage 3 tax cuts amendment. Of course we support that because it supports families across the board. But when you give the average family $800 with one hand and they are losing 8.6 per cent, or $8,000, from the average wage with the other you are looking through the rear-view mirror and not through the windshield. We have a problem with government spending in this place. When you look through the Intergenerational report, which I've got here in front of me, on real 2022-23 incomes the executive in this place, Canberra, spends $25,000 per Australian. Not adjusted for inflation, that was $15,000 in 2002-03. And it's projected, in the Intergenerational report—again, not adjusted for inflation—to be $40,000. I urge the government to take a leaf out of Jelly Roll's speeches. He recently appeared before the US Congress. There was a hearing on fentanyl in January, and he's someone who has spent time in jail for dealing drugs. He said: I was part of the problem … I am here now, standing as a man who wants to be part of the solution. That is good advice for this government. It is an undeniable reality that people across our communities are doing it tough—all across our economy, all across our country and in every state. The reality of that is not the government of the last 18 months. There have been a range of structural failings throughout the last decade when it comes to economic leadership in our country. To give you some flavour of that in terms of headline realities, we saw the worst productivity growth for half a century, under the last government. We saw a decade of real wage decline, and the worst part about that is that we of course know that that was, as the Liberals themselves say, a deliberate design feature of the economy over which they presided. We've seen our country saddled with a trillion dollars of Liberal debt. These are the preconditions that set up our economy and indeed set up our communities to suffer over this last period of time.  We know that the inflation problem, which has been such a key driver of the cost-of-living challenge facing our communities, was created and incubated under that former government. They failed utterly to invest in sovereign capability across our economy. They left us open to the international pressures that have ultimately thrust our economy into the high-inflation circumstances in which it finds itself. To be fair, there are some international events that no government could necessarily have foreseen or necessarily managed the risks of—wars in both Europe and the Middle East chief amongst them. Nevertheless, what the former Liberal government did was design an economy and execute the policy settings for that economy that left our community so vulnerable and so exposed to those international pressures. We know that inflation peaked under that former Liberal government. And, yes, our government has been very upfront, as has the Reserve Bank, in its independent role, about the need to drive that inflation down and the fact that it would take time and it would be challenging, and that there would be both monetary and fiscal policy elements to that effect. At the end of the day, our government has approached this challenge with our values at the centre of our policy treatment. We want to build an economy that works for our people. We want Australian workers to earn more and keep more of what they earn. We know that that is the best way to alleviate that cost-of-living pressure on Australian households and to aid Australian families and workers in recovering from this difficult period. We've been moving Labor's tax cut plan through the parliament with the very lukewarm support, I have to acknowledge, of the Liberals. They say publicly that they support our tax cuts, but they have frustrated at every opportunity the process of legislating them, and we know that they have spent a significant amount of time and energy undermining them within the broader community. Most notably, the deputy leader of the Liberal Party came out immediately to state that they would repeal tax cuts for Australian workers—roll them back. In my community, these tax cuts are worth $1,428 to each average worker. In a household with two full-time workers on an average wage that's over $2,800 a year. That means that 73,000 taxpayers across my community, and the families and households that they support, will all get a tax cut. Every single taxpayer will get a tax cut, just as every single taxpayer across Australia will get a tax cut—that's 13.6 million Australians getting a tax cut and 73,000 just in my electorate alone. When the Liberals stand up and make ridiculous, outrageous comments about the cost of living, Australians know that they don't truly understand or believe in addressing those matters and that they, ultimately, are accountable for the circumstances that created those conditions in the first place. Our government is the one making the necessary changes in order to address them. I do want to talk on this MPI, as a member of parliament from a rural and regional electorate, to the young people who are here today. I come from a very small community. There is no doubt that that community, and the others that I represent, are very affected by cost-of-living issues. There is no question in rural and regional Australia that that's exactly how it is, and why the increases in interest rates, which have put up their mortgages throughout this time of this government, have had so much impact. There's also an issue with the inflationary impact on the food that people are buying. There have also been the increasing costs of insurance that we in the regions really have no option but to invest in. Then there are increases in the cost of electricity and, as we know, increases in the cost of housing. When I hear the members opposite talking about child care, in my part of the world—as in so many other parts of Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas—we have childcare deserts, where there isn't any child care is available. That makes it exceptionally difficult for people who need to go to work and can't.  We've seen, as I said, increases in interest rates, inflation, mortgage costs and rents, as we know. Rents have increased by at least 26 per cent over the time that Labor has been in government and we've seen housing starts and approvals at their lowest levels in decades. I looked at rentals on realestate.com: good luck trying to find a rental in my part of the world. The vacancy rate in my Bunbury region is 0.45 per cent: the nation's lowest vacancy rate for the seventh consecutive month. If you're coming into my electorate, you'll find it very difficult; but it has been made more difficult by Labor's increases, with the over 500,000 people it has allowed into this country when there are only 162,000 new dwellings being built at the same time. There is a real imbalance there, which is why, in part, those rental prices are what they are: it's scarcity. I walk down the main street in my communities, and I talk to the local people and the local businesses, and I listen to them. When you do that, you find that the cost of living is really impacting on my people. It's also impacting on small businesses, who are the heart and soul of my electorate. Recently, in this last week, I talked to the car dealers, because they are certainly very concerned about what Labor is proposing with their huge tax on not only the family car but also on our work vehicles. We depend on those vehicles; we need them in rural and regional Australia. We need them for the job they do for us; that's what we need on our properties and in our businesses. It's the same as our tradies. They need these vehicles; they're not just an option, they're something we need to get the job done. But Labor wants to make this so much more expensive. I went to one dealer who employs 70 people. He is seriously concerned about the types of vehicles that will be allowed to come in with the whole-fleet requirement that the government will impose. There's another one who employs 20 staff—that may not be a lot to those on that side, but, by gee, in the small community where I am, employing 20 people is a lot of people in work in a small community, and each one of those matters to us. That's why this extra tax on family vehicles, tradies and our working people is such a major issue. We'll see that some vehicles will no longer be imported, which is what the government is intending here: by default—it's very clever—to restrict the sorts of vehicles that will be imported. The manufacturers who are based internationally will decide what they will export here and what they can actually put on the list for Australia. Of course, what concerns me is that this will push us into buying more vehicles made in China. Well, that is something that Australia cannot afford to do. I also note that the government is trying to dictate to Australians not only what car you drive, whether it's the family car or it's a ute; they want to control the food you eat. There's the NHMRC's war on meat. There are the clothes you wear—and the minister for environment wanting to tax our clothes and tell us what clothes we can wear. We've got carbon accounting on scope 3 emissions. We've got the increase— (Time expired) On a topic around priorities and governance, I'm actually really proud to be part of a government who has the right priorities and is delivering good government—good government that we were voted in by the voters of Australia to deliver. But, before I address some of the things that our government has been taking action on, I do just want to pause and say I'm really disgusted at the way migrants have been weaponised by those opposite. Particularly when I see, like through question time this week, people sitting opposite who regularly attend citizenship ceremonies with me in my electorate and who speak in glowing terms about migrants, and I then hear some of those members opposite undermine migration in this country—  The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Ms Claydon ): Just a moment—are you rising on a point of order? Mr Wolahan: I am. It's standing order 90: reflections on members. That is an allegation or imputation of improper motive on the debate of all members on this side and on an area that we all take very seriously on a bipartisan basis. The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I ask you to resume your seat. I've listened to the debate, and all kinds of suggestions have been made. I note there's been no naming mentioned here. I ask the member to always be cautious in her approach, and let's try and have a respectful debate all around. Dr GARLAND: Indeed, my intention in raising this issue was really to heighten the level of debate in this chamber. But I'll move on. Since the election our No. 1 priority has been to address inflation and cost-of-living pressures. We know a lot of people in our communities are doing it tough. That's why our recently announced tax cuts will deliver a bigger tax cut for Middle Australia to help with the cost of living. This builds on our targeted relief while not adding to inflation. Let's talk about priorities. We've already delivered electricity bill relief. We've made medicines cheaper and we've made it easier and cheaper to see a doctor. We've invested in cheaper child care and in expanding parental leave. We are building more social and affordable homes and increasing rent assistance. We've also provided fee-free TAFE, and wages are rising at the fastest rate for a decade, including for some of our lowest-paid workers on the minimum wage and aged-care workers. We've done all of this at the same time as we've delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years and created a record number of jobs. We know we have a big job to do. Good governments do have a big job to do, because they take their commitment to Australians really seriously. We're making vital investments in the capacity of our economy, laying the foundations for future growth, and our efforts to repair the budget are taking pressure off inflation when it is most acute. Right throughout our term, we have maintained a primary focus on the cost of living, wages, jobs and building a stronger economy for all Australians. Real wages growth is back and ahead of schedule, and we want Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn. This week, we saw the latest wage figures are showing a 4.2 per cent increase throughout the year, the equal fastest annual growth since 2009. This is a real wage increase for people. The gender pay gap is the lowest it has been on record. It's down by 2.1 per cent since the government came to office. And of course, on 1 July, every single Australian taxpayer will be getting a tax cut because of Labor tax plan. We want Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. Those opposite want Australians to work longer for less. Those opposite have no plan to ease the cost of living. All those opposite offer Australians is negativity and division. Over the last 18 months the opposition has consistently stood against action to help ease the cost of living. They've opposed more Australian jobs, they've opposed higher wages and better working conditions, they've opposed electricity bill relief, they've opposed cheaper medicines, they've opposed fee-free TAFE and now they don't even really know what they want to do about our Labor cost-of-living tax cuts. They're all negativity and no plan. I urge those opposite to do the right thing, stop the delays and back our economic reform in the Senate to ease the cost of living for all Australian taxpayers. On this side of House, we offer aspiration, ideas and action. Those opposite offer negativity and division. I'm proud to be part of a government that prioritises people over politics and is getting on with the job of good government that we were voted in to do.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","400","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The coalition supports the passage of the Autonomous Sanctions Amendment Bill 2024. The bill seeks to amend the Autonomous Sanctions Act 2011, the act to confirm the validity of existing future sanctions made under the Autonomous Sanctions Regulations 2011. More specifically, the bill confirms that individuals and/or entities can be validly sanctioned based on past conduct or status, regardless of the time which has occurred between conduct and application of the sanction, and clarifies that, in circumstances where it is not explicitly clear whether a minister considered their discretion to list or not list, the listing is nonetheless valid where the person or entity meets the criteria for imposing sanctions.  Australia's sanctions regime—for example, imposing travel bans or financial sanctions freezing assets held in Australia—is a key tool for Australia to enforce the values that our nation seeks to uphold. As the former coalition government made clear when we introduced the Magnitsky-style sanctions in 2021, we use sanctions to deny those who do the wrong thing the benefit of accessing our economy and the freedoms that our democracy allows. As has been highlighted since the sanctions imposed on the hundreds of supporters of Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, some of those individual sanctions have deep pockets and the desire and resources to seek to exploit any technical avenue to continue to be able to access any ill-gotten gains that may exist in Australia. Recent court cases have shown the lengths to which some of these individuals will go to seek to undermine Australia's sanctions regime. While the Federal Court ruled in favour of the minister in these cases, at least one of these decisions is being appealed. We want to ensure that we are able to prevent, for instance, any Russian who has been involved with that deplorable, illegal invasion of Ukraine from getting access to their ill-gotten gains here in Australia. And we should be doing all we can to go after these individuals. The action the parliament is taking, and the action the coalition supports, is to reinforce this parliament's unambiguous view that Australia's sanctions regime is robust and that the decisions of all previous Australian government ministers to sanction an individual or entity were intentional and remain valid, regardless of any attempt by others to seek to challenge them. We want to make sure that we have a strong and enforceable regime. The coalition's strong track record points to this. We did it in government and we're happy to lend our support to ensure that it occurs while we're in opposition. Australia has a strong history of promoting and protecting human rights globally, supporting the international rules-based order and acting in the interests of international peace and security. Former coalition governments imposed sanctions on Mr Putin, Russian individuals and entities, and supporters of the Russian regime. These included using sanctions in response to the downing of MH17 and the murder of its 298 passengers and crew, including 28 who called Australia home, and for his role in Russia's annexation of Crimea. We also imposed over 800 sanctions on Russian interests and supporters, including in Belarus, within weeks of Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The coalition has continued and will continue to provide bipartisan support for the Albanese Labor government to increase support for Ukraine, including by additional sanctions Australia has imposed on Russian individuals, entities and supporters. In December 2021, under the coalition, Australia expanded its autonomous sanctions laws to enable the establishment of Magnitsky-style and other thematic sanctions. We would also say to the government: for anything additional that you want to do to help and support Ukraine, you will have bipartisanship all the way. I was in Federation Square on Saturday afternoon for the second anniversary of that illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine by Russia. There is no question that we need to be doing all we can to support Ukraine. What Russia is doing to that country and to its people is deplorable. It's beyond words. It's despicable and disgraceful, and it deserves utter condemnation. While the coalition has welcomed the limited sanctions the government has imposed on countries since May 2022, in far too many cases Australia continues to lag behind our international partners and allies in using our sanctions regime to hold to account those responsible for human rights abuses. The government has a penchant for being a follower, not a leader, when it comes to imposing sanctions. Australia needs to act swiftly to send a clear and unequivocal message that the international community will not tolerate impunity for gross violations of human rights and the rule of law. We welcome the latest announcement from the government, on 24 February 2024, imposing further targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 55 persons and targeted financial sanctions on 37 entities, including sanctions targeting those involved in Russia's deportation of Ukrainian children from regions under temporary Russian control—a despicable act. However, sanctions targeting those involved in Russia's deportation of Ukrainian children could have been done months ago. The EU imposed similar sanctions in June 2023, the UK in July 2023, the US in August 2023 and Canada in September 2023. We say to the government, with the greatest of respect: please, let's act quickly, especially against this insidious Russian regime. Missing in the announcement of 24 February 2024 were sanctions imposed on those responsible for the death of Alexei Navalny—sanctions that the coalition called for on 21 February 2024. These sanctions came two days later, when the government announcement targeted sanctions on seven prison officials that were involved in the mistreatment and death in custody. I take the opportunity to note that Mr Navalny's death represents not only a profound loss for those who champion democracy and human rights around the world but also serves as a stark reminder of the criticality of taking all reasonable actions against the ongoing suppression of dissent and political opposition in Russia. I'd also note that, in December last year, the coalition called on the government to impose more targeted sanctions against high-ranking Hamas officials. That will have a real impact in supporting Israel's campaign to disable Hamas and prevent it from committing such atrocities again. Almost a month later, on 23 January 2024, the government acted, announcing further counterterrorism financing sanctions on 12 persons and three entities linked to Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestine Islamic Jihad. The coalition welcome this, but it's important to look at the detail. This was announced at the same time as the US announced its fifth round of sanctions on Hamas since the 7 October terrorist attack. The latest US sanctions targeted networks of Hamas-affiliated financial exchanges in Gaza, their owners and associates and particularly financial facilitators that have played key roles in funds transfers, including cryptocurrency transfers, from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force to Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad in Gaza. However, none of the entities or individuals sanctioned by the US in their announcement of 22 January 2024 were included in the sanctions announced by this government. If we are to get peace, we need to dismantle Hamas. All 12 entities and three individuals that Australia sanctioned last month have previously been sanctioned by some of our allies. For example, Mahmoud al-Zahar is a senior member and co-founder of Hamas who has worked closely with specially designated global terrorists and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and has spoken publicly on behalf of Hamas, including in formal interviews, to threaten violence against Jewish civilians and emphasise Hamas's commitment to the destruction of Israel. He was sanctioned by the US on 14 November 2023 and the UK on 13 December 2023. Ali Morshed Shirazi, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force—officials who train and assist PIJ Hamas and Hezbollah—were sanctioned by the US on 27 October 2023 and the UK on 13 December 2023. Rather than playing catch-up, Australia should be working in lock step with allies to dismantle Hamas's financial infrastructure, including from external sources, and to block new funding channels they seek to finance their heinous acts. While the coalition has welcomed the limited sanctions the government has imposed on countries since May 2022, in far too many cases Australia continues to lag behind our international partners and allies in using our sanctions regime to hold to account those responsible for human rights abuses. Prior to the last election, in an address to the Australian Institute of International Affairs, Senator Wong called on the Morrison government to: … consider targeted sanctions on foreign companies, officials and other entities known to be directly profiting from Uyghur forced labour and other human rights abuses … At the halfway mark of their first term, no such action has been taken by the Albanese government. On the August anniversary of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights report into the forced detention and treatment of Uyghurs, Human Rights Watch Australia highlighted the action of the EU, US, UK and Canada to apply sanctions. They said: … the Australian government should join other democracies in holding serious human rights abusers in China to account. By not doing this, what message is Australia sending? We can all draw conclusions about why Australia may not have acted, even though the coalition has offered bipartisan support for actions as a result of the OHCHR's findings. By not acting, Australia weakens international efforts and the effectiveness of the efforts of others. As the Human Rights First coalition put it in their global review of Magnitsky at five years: As powerful as it can be for one jurisdiction to impose Magnitsky sanctions against a human rights abuser or corrupt actor, the impact and legitimacy of those sanctions are multiplied as more jurisdictions join together to sanction the same persons. Acting with key allies in a joint and timely manner is the best way for us to go. In closing, the coalition supports this bill and reiterates its offer of bipartisanship for the government to impose targeted sanctions in line with those of our allies, whether in response to Russian abuses, human rights abuses in Xinjiang or numerous other instances of human rights violations. Debate adjourned.","Autonomous Sanctions Amendment Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TEHAN (Wannon) ","(16:41):"

The bill is a one-schedule amendment to ACL that empowers the relevant minister to appoint entities as designated complainants, granting them the power to progress complaints directly to the ACCC and receive a response within 90 days.  In deciding whether to approve an applicant as a designated complainant, the minister must have regard to two things: firstly, the applicant's experience and ability in representing the interests of consumers or small businesses, or both, in Australia in relation to a range of market issues that affect them; and, secondly, the extent to which the applicant will act with integrity as a complainant. I note that the coalition will be watching closely who the minister approves. It must not be used as a chance to reward Labor Party friends or union paymasters, and on the other side it must be there for legitimate organisations that are representing their members who are small businesses and farmers to the extent that they have good reason to act in the interests of those members on a competition or consumer issue. The ACCC may notify a designated complainant that they will act through a further action notice if they're satisfied that a designated complaint relates to a significant or systemic market issue that affects consumers or small businesses in Australia, or both, and relates either to a potential breach of the act or to one or more of the ACCC's powers or functions under the act. If the ACCC is not satisfied that these matters apply in relation to a designated complaint, they must issue a no-further-action notice, and they may also issue a no-further-action notice in other specific circumstances. If the ACCC proposes to act upon a designated complaint, the ACCC must use best endeavours to commence that action as soon as practicable, within a maximum of six months. Any response must be based on the existing powers of the ACCC and functions under the act, including education, research and compliance as well as enforcement functions. What this bill does not do is reverse the damage this government has done with bad economic decisions. What it doesn't do is champion a back-to-basics economic agenda; that is the best way to give a fair go to consumers, small businesses and farmers across this great nation, and that means getting the basics right. We've seen a collapse in Australians' real disposable incomes of 8.6 per cent in just 18 months. We've seen a sharp increase in the price of pretty much everything. There has been an almost-10-per-cent increase in prices on average in the last 18 months, and we've seen many things go up far, far more than that. We've seen 12 interest rate increases, and we've seen a massive increase—a 27 per cent increase—in personal income taxes being paid. That means that Australians have seen a collapse in their standard of living. They're responding in many different ways: they're digging into their savings, they're taking on extra hours and they're cutting out any spending in their household budgets that's not absolutely essential. All of this is having a very big impact on Australians' standard of living. We need, right now, an agenda that is focused on getting the basics right. However you might attempt to redistribute the pie, if the pie is not growing—if the pie is, indeed, shrinking, which is what's happening to our economic pie right now on a GDP per person basis—then Australians are always going to be worse off. Getting the basics right means knowing where government has a role to play and where it doesn't. It means making sure that your competition policy is right, not just pursuing some version of crony capitalism, as we saw last year with the Qantas issue. A back-to-basics agenda does mean ending waste, not spending $40 million of taxpayer money on a spin unit to sell a broken promise. It means workplace laws that are sensible and flexible and that are in the interests of both bosses and employees so they can sit down together and make their workplace more competitive, more productive and, most importantly, more prosperous for both the employer and employee. That's a time honoured achievement of workplaces in this country, and that's from both sides of politics, I should say. Through the eighties and the nineties and into the noughties, we saw incredible improvement in our workplaces, and that kind of flexibility is something that workers and employers have enjoyed and benefited from, and we need to see a focus back on those basics. We live in a country and with economy where, if you give opportunities for people to get ahead, to realise their aspirations, they create opportunities for others. This is something that is absolutely essential in thinking about what's right for Australia at a time when we are facing a cost-of-living crisis. But for Australians who are given the opportunity to get ahead, who are given incentive to get ahead, the rewards for effort create jobs and opportunities not just for themselves but for others—jobs, investment and opportunity for all. Those opposite can continue to play class wars in industrial relations and other areas of policy, and they can continue to pursue the politics of envy, but, on this side of the House, we will continue to support aspiration, opportunity and prosperity for all. We have a strong record of supporting strong competition policy and support for small businesses and farmers across Australia. We delivered policies, including the default market offer in the energy market, and despite the fact that under our current energy manager we've seen sharp increases in prices—Australians certainly haven't seen the $275. The default market offer was a good, strong measure to support consumers in the electricity market, and it's certainly been of benefit. At the time that was brought in, we saw an eight per cent reduction in prices for consumers, a nine per cent reduction for small businesses and a 10 per cent reduction for industry. We established the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct. It's right and proper now, having seen that in operation for some time, that we work alongside our National Party colleagues in making sure that that is right for the times—times that are obviously changing. We legislated to address energy market misconduct, and we established the payment times reporting framework. We also delivered significant support for Australia's 3.7 million small and medium sized businesses, including the small-business company tax rate reduction and extending the instant asset write-off. We've said in recent months that we would take that back to the higher level and the appropriate thresholds that were in place prior to COVID. Labor has scaled that back. But that instant asset write-off is incredibly important for small businesses and farmers. It gives them the opportunity to make investments in capital equipment, in items that are going to make their businesses more productive, more competitive and more successful. And that is good not just for them; it's good for their communities, their employees, their suppliers and their customers. That's how the economy works. We know and we've all seen—those of us that represent electorates where small business is the backbone of the local economy—the incredible impact of accelerated depreciation on the prosperity of those local economies. We established the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. I'm very hopeful that that ombudsman will be one of the organisations that the minister approves as a designated complainant under this legislation so the ombudsman can do the important work it needs to do to support small business and farmers across this country. We will take further strong competition policy measures to the next election, and we will continue to focus, as we have in recent months and years, on the interests of small businesses and farmers in being able to ensure that their suppliers and customers are competitive. But that's also crucially important for customers more generally. Competition policy matters. I'm a huge believer in it, and I have been for a very long time. Indeed, it was the focus of my postgraduate thesis. I didn't write a long tome on Paul Keating; I wrote a tome on competition policy. I have, for decades, believed that the best regulator of any industry is an empowered customer. There is no better regulator of any industry than an absolutely empowered customer who is able to say to their supplier, 'Look, I want a better deal.' I'll tell you what—it works. We will be supporting this legislation, and I will work with the relevant minister to make sure this legislation comes through in an appropriate form. In line with the comments I have already made, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes:  (1) that the former Coalition government delivered strong competition policy for consumers, including:  (a) the Default Market Offer;  (b) establishing the Food & Grocery Code of Conduct;  (c) legislating to address Energy Market Misconduct; and  (d) establishing the Payment Times Reporting Framework;  (2) that the former Coalition government delivered significant support for Australia's 3.7 million small and medium businesses, including:  (a) reducing the small business company tax rate;  (b) extending the Instant Asset Write Off; and  (c) establishing the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman;  (3) that the best way to give a fair go to consumers and small business is to manage the economy well and bring down inflation; and  (4) the government is failing on both counts, with falling productivity, stubbornly high domestic inflation, and collapsing real wages for working households'.

That is what Labor is doing now. Imagine having the power to help every renter who is saving up a deposit to buy a home only to find that, by the time it comes to buy or to the auction, house prices have gone up so much they have to save even more. Imagine having the power to help every first homebuyer who turns up to an auction only to find that they're outbid by an investor who's getting a government subsidy.  Imagine having that power and deciding not to use it, but instead deciding to use the power of government to say, 'If you've already got four homes, we will help you with a big fat cheque to go and buy your fifth, your sixth, your seventh or your eighth'—because that is what this Labor Party is doing with the power of government. Labor is making the housing and rental crisis worse. Labor is backing unlimited rent rises, saying that there should be no limit on how much rents can go up. Labor are saying to every renter and first home buyer who is struggling to find an affordable place to live that they would rather back the wealthy property investor who turns up at an auction to go and buy multiple properties even as some people are struggling to get their first. That is what this government is doing. As a result, it is pushing people to breaking point. I talked about how Labor's plan, which this bill is based on, involves helping wealthy property investors. I want to take a moment to explain how this scheme, supported by Labor and costing the public billions, works. At the moment, if a wealthy property investor with multiple properties turns up at an auction where there are first home buyers who've scraped and saved for a deposit, that wealthy property investor has an advantage. They have a big fat cheque from the Labor government sitting in their pocket. How does that work? It work like this. The first home buyer will bid at the auction as much as they are able to afford, as much as they have been able to save up for a deposit plus whatever they hope that they are going to be able to repay. The wealthy property investor, however, turns up at that auction and, as the first home buyer puts their hand up to bid, can outbid them time after time, knowing that no matter how high the price goes they will be able to write off any losses they make as a tax break. In other words, they can pay as much they want for the property, much more than the first home buyer is able to afford, knowing that when they go and rent it out if they made a loss they can write that off on their tax and get a tax break. The first home buyer can't do that, but the wealthy property investor can. It's not only that; it gets worse. They know that, thanks to Labor, in a few years time, or whenever they want to, they can sell the property and they only have to pay half the tax on it. They'll get a capital gains tax discount. But someone who has made their money through working, after they've paid the cost of their massive HECS debt that has gone up thanks to Labor, after what's available having paid extraordinary grocery bills that the government won't rein in and having dealt with massive rising costs of living, doesn't get to write off the cost of the payment on their mortgage or the payment on their rent as a tax break. They have to pay the same amount of tax on their taxable income that everyone else in the country has to. Because the tax comes out before you have even met those expenditures, the tax comes out at the start, you don't get a choice. Your employer takes the tax out. You have to pay your tax. But if you have managed to make your money out of buying and selling and flipping properties, having got a nice tax break along the way, you then get another tax break thanks to Labor. This is why, in large part, our property market is so turbocharged. The first home buyer who's struggling to get in has to scrimp and save, but they'll be competing against a wealthy property investor who knows, firstly, they can push up the price as much they want knowing that they can write off any loss as a tax dodge and, secondly, when it comes time to sell the property they'll get another tax break. The system is stacked against first home buyers and renters, and Labor is backing it. It is costing the budget. It's $15 billion going on these kinds of tax breaks—negative gearing and capital gains tax. If you add up all the other tax breaks that these wealthy property investors get, you are looking at close to $40 billion. Renters don't get that. First home buyers don't get that. The money is going to those who've already got multiple properties to go and buy even more. That is Labor's answer to the housing crisis. Then they say, 'It's okay; we're going to bring a bill to parliament to fix it,' and they continue this system of rorts that is stacked against first home buyers and renters. Labor needs to wake up. The housing crisis and the rental crisis are breaking people. They are breaking people, and Labor is pushing rents and house prices up. Labor is backing unlimited rent rises and billions in handouts to wealthy property investors that are driving mortgages and house prices up and up. Labor say they want to address this, but here we are, a couple of years into their government, and Labor come along and say: 'This is the silver bullet that will fix it. This is our whole answer to the housing crisis.' It's a bill that maintains all of those tax breaks for wealthy property investors and that will help push up prices and leave 99.8 per cent of renters worse off. Labor comes in with a bill that is aimed at pushing up prices and continuing to give tax handouts to wealthy property investors. The system at the moment is stacked against first home buyers and renters. The Greens will fight for first home buyers and renters while Labor fights for wealthy property investors. Seventy-five per cent of the members of the government have got these investment properties. The Greens are here to fight and to end these rorts that the property class are enjoying because the first home buyers and renters are suffering. You see it every day and every week as first home buyers turn up to auctions, only to be outbid by a wealthy property investor who's got a big fat cheque in their pocket thanks to Labor. You see that every day, but what we also hear is parents who are saying they are worried that their kids will never be able to own a home in this wealthy country of ours that is Australia, even if they do the right thing. You have first home buyers and renters who say, 'I've done the right thing.' They went to TAFE. They went to university. They've studied hard. They've worked hard. They've got a good job. They've got an income. They might even have a partner who's got a good income as well. They're doing all the right things and still under Labor they can't find an affordable place to live, because Labor backs unlimited rent rises and skyrocketing house prices. What does Labor say to all of those people who've done the right thing and done everything that they were asked to do? Labor says, 'We're going to spend between $15 billion and $40 billion helping the wealthy property investors who've already got multiple properties to go and buy even more.' That is Labor's answer to the people who are doing all the right things and that is why people are becoming increasingly angry with this government that has got enormous power, including the power to fix the housing and rental crisis. Instead Labor uses its power to make the housing and rental crisis worse. I can't sit here in this parliament, see Labor come and say, 'This is our answer to the housing crisis: a bill that's going to push up housing prices, leave 99.8 per cent of renters worse off and continue to give billions of dollars in handouts to wealthy property investors,' and back it. That is not good enough. That does not get our support. Labor may continue fighting for wealthy property investors, but the Greens are going to fight for first home buyers and renters. We cannot support this policy that leaves people worse off while continuing to slip a big fat cheque into the pockets of people who've already got multiple properties. These massive handouts from Labor to wealthy property investors are denying millions of renters the chance to buy their own home. That cannot be supported. These policies from the government were cooked up by a small-target opposition when they were running around not offering an alternative to Scott Morrison's prime ministership and government but instead trying to be the smallest of small targets, coming up with bandaid solutions that are all about being seen to do something to address the housing crisis rather than actually doing something. So they dreamt up this policy while they were trying to be a small-target opposition. But the housing crisis has only got worse under Labor. Labor's housing and rental crisis is now breaking people; it is much worse now than it was even a couple of years ago. If the government can change their position on stage 3 tax cuts, under pressure from the Greens, because of changed economic circumstances and the growing crisis, then they can change their position on these tax handouts to the wealthy property investors as well. If Labor can change their position on stage 3 tax cuts, under pressure from the Greens, because of changed economic circumstances, then they can change their position on giving tax handouts to wealthy property investors that are denying millions of renters the chance to buy their own home. We are saying very clearly to Labor that, if you want our support, then: start tackling capital gains tax and negative-gearing concessions, which are pushing homes out of the reach of millions of renters; cap and freeze rents, because that will give people the breathing space to deal with Labor's housing crisis; and build more public housing. You've got the power of government. Use it to make people's lives better; don't use it, Labor, to advantage wealthy property investors who've already got four, five, six, seven or eight properties. They don't need a government subsidy. It's first home buyers and renters who need help. The more that Labor continues down this road of backing the wealthy property investors and denying millions of renters the chance to buy their own home, the angrier people are going to get. We are offering you our support as the Greens if you're willing to tackle the causes of the housing crisis and not just come in here with policies that actually leave people worse off and that are about being seen to do something rather than actually doing something—because people can see through you, Labor. They can see that you're just being seen to do something rather than actually doing something. These small-target policies won't cut it anymore. Small-target government cannot fix Australia's big problems like the housing and rental crisis. I say this: if you don't use this opportunity in the House, then we won't be supporting this bill in the House. You've got the chance, before it goes to the Senate, to start tackling these big issues of tax handouts to the wealthy, building more public housing and capping and freezing rents. But, if you choose not to, Labor—if you make 2024 the year that you continue backing wealthy property investors—then the anger from renters and first home buyers is going to continue to grow. I hope that Labor comes to its senses and decides to tackle the housing crisis this year by working with the Greens. If it doesn't, don't be surprised if renters make their voice heard at the next election and take it out on Labor at the ballot box because Labor's backing wealthy property investors while the Greens are backing renters and first home buyers. Every so often in this place, there come moments when we have an ability to define what Australia is all about—or the future of Australia, really, for better or worse. We sit here quite uniquely privileged to help shape the future of our nation; I think that's why we're all here. I can't think of more pressing issues for Australians than the cost of living and housing. Everywhere I go in my electorate of Wills, people share their experiences of housing becoming more and more out of reach, and that's been the case for a number of years. This is an issue for everyone, including younger Australians, who feel completely locked out of the housing market—and I agree with them. For 10 years the coalition government sat on the treasury bench over there and allowed the issue of housing to, effectively, fester, ignoring the pleas for help and assistance from younger generations of Australians. Today, the Albanese Labor government are actually answering the call to action and we're taking action. Fundamentally, housing is the foundational aspect of building a better life. It's the basis on which people can realise their full potential and an issue close to my heart. I think many people here would share that as well. My own story is one that is probably emblematic of the old Australian dream of homeownership. I'm the son of migrant parents. I remember growing up in a housing commission flat. Admittedly it was a little rough, but I also remember the sense of gratitude that I had. It was really the successive state and federal Labor governments—particularly the Hawke Labor government at the time—and their policies that gave my family the safety, the security and the sense of belonging through which we were able to access public housing and good education. These policies made a huge difference. Those housing policies gave my family and me a place to call home. So, yes, I'm a houso and proud of that, and the son of migrants parents and proud of that. Through their hard work, they were able to save up enough to move out of the housing commission and buy their own home. Now, in the early eighties, when they did that, the average house price was around 3.3 times an Australian's annual income. Today the average house price is about 10 times or more the average income, so there's a huge disparity there. Having been a beneficiary of governments getting housing policy right, that kind of upbringing informs my perspective on housing policy today. The view is quite simple. The starting point for me as a first principle is that housing is a human right. Like many, I want housing to be not a distant dream but a reality for Australians. In many ways, in my electorate of Wills, that is indicative of the aspiration that many Australians have. We know that many rent. We know that many have mortgages and are under pressure. But everyone in the community wants to realise their full potential as well. People in my community of Wills regularly contact me and outline the immense housing stresses they face. While in our office we do our best to help support people, whether they need assistance with the housing authority or housing commission to get better accommodation or whether they need emergency accommodation. We do that work, and I know many MPs do the same type of work. The reality, though, is this: focusing on reform and long-term solutions is really the only way you're going to make big changes and help Australia move forward on this issue. Long-term focus and structural reform will deliver that lasting benefit to millions of people who need it most, just as it did some 45 to 50 years ago, when I first started out. If you look back that far in history, you see that the 1940s to the 1970s was really the era of the so-called Australian dream of homeownership, though back in the eighties and nineties, house prices were still very much lower than they are today, as I said. Buyers would borrow less, save smaller deposits and spend less of their overall income on housing. Today owning a home outright has dropped by 10 per cent and rental stress is worsening. For young people, homeownership is harder than ever before. Rental stress is a significant issue, particularly for young Australians, single-parent families, low-wage workers and older Australians on fixed incomes. Many young people are facing rent increase after rent increase, making it unaffordable to make ends meet, let alone save for a house deposit. This also includes essential workers: nurses, aged-care workers, early educators, police, ambos and those in hospitality. They are effectively priced out of the rental market, particularly in inner-city areas. Some workers spend half to two-thirds of their income on rent. They tend to have to commute long distances from their homes to the hospitals, stations or other places of work. These are the same essential workers who with such bravery and dedication helped us get through the pandemic. Around one million renters across the country live in homes that are unsafe for their health as well. This is an important issue in this debate, but they're afraid to speak up and request repairs, in case they get evicted. As many in this place know, single women over 55 are particularly vulnerable to homelessness. These are often women who were more likely to have taken on family or carer responsibilities, working casual or part-time roles, and have less or no super to fall back on. It is unacceptable that, in a country endowed with wealth and opportunity, many of our fellow Australians have nowhere to call home. We cannot continue to let this happen. We can't simply accept this reality that 70 per cent of young people believe they will never own their own home, which is the polling that suggests that lack of belief. We cannot forfeit responsibility for future generations, who are demanding that we act. This is a place where we debate politics, and we can't let the previous government have a free pass on the failures over nine years which oversaw an increase in housing construction costs of some 46 per cent. Former prime minister Morrison said he didn't believe in a legacy. Well, he left a legacy of higher house prices, higher rents and greater housing stress, a legacy that's left many Australians unable to buy their own home. Equally, we have the Greens political party pushing for policies that don't and actually can't work. They've been preaching about a rent freeze, as we heard from the previous speaker. I've got some news for the previous speaker: it doesn't actually work. The data from international jurisdictions shows that for properties under rent controls there were increases in price and for properties not under rent controls there was ghettoisation and deterioration. This is just hard data and evidence that exists. So, basically, you've got the Greens party, who are free to play politics in this place and to grandstand, incomprehensibly when it comes to this bill voting with the coalition against the Help to Buy scheme. They are voting against the Help to Buy scheme for political gain and as political grandstanding. It's remarkable. In contrast, the Albanese Labor government is focused on the substance of these policies. To make a genuine difference to people's lives is what we are doing this for. What is the substance of the bill that the Greens political party and the coalition parties are voting against? We just heard from the previous speaker that they are not going to support it. That's out of their own mouth. This bill presents an actual unmistakeable opportunity to reverse the decade of decline in serious housing policy. It's an opportunity the House and the Senate should take and must take. The Help to Buy scheme fulfils Labor's election commitment to support up to 40,000 Australian families and households to purchase a home of their own. This will mean the government will support eligible homebuyers with an equity of up to 40 per cent for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes. This policy will not only provide a foot in the door for Australians with smaller savings but also provide long-term relief for Australians who are part of the scheme. Our broad housing agenda, as the minister outlined, is directly addressing the issue of supply. It is all about supply, supply, supply. The government has already helped more than 80,000 Australians into homeownership and, thanks to this legislation, many more Australians will have the opportunity to afford their own home. Over the next five years, we will build 1.2 million new homes to increase supply. Importantly, this policy also has cost-of-living assistance built into it. As a result of the equity stake the government will have in this scheme, first home buyers will be able to have a smaller deposit, a minimum of two per cent, and will have lower ongoing repayments while they participate in the scheme. In addition, the Help to Buy legislation will help eligible new homeowners save hundreds of dollars a month on their mortgages. This is an example of long-term relief for a problem that is decades old. It's real. It will matter to these people. These are real people. It will make a real difference to their lives every single day. This is on top of the many initiatives our housing minister has already been spearheading. We have heard from previous speakers that apparently this is suddenly supposed to be a silver bullet. I will say that there is a lot more ammo in the chamber. There are a lot of policies that we have actually announced and started to implement over the last year and a half, such as bolstering renters' rights and providing financial support to those doing it tough. We've increased the Commonwealth rental assistance by the largest amount in 30 years—15 per cent—to provide cost-of-living assistance to renters experiencing financial stress. In addition, our government has been working extremely hard with states and territories on a renters' rights charter. This includes nationally consistent policies on genuine grounds for eviction, allowing security changes without landlord permission, making rental applications easier, protecting personal information and much, much more. Action on renters' rights is a priority for the government. We don't hide our ambition to ensure that in this country homeownership is within reach of any Aussie who aspires to it. When I was reflecting on my remarks prior to this debate, I thought of many of my constituents that I have spoken to about this issue. I thought particularly of one woman. Her name is Mary. She spoke to me at a community event. She talked of the stresses that are synonymous with temporary accommodation and knowing that she is at risk of homelessness. I thought of Ismael and Zali, who told me recently that, even with both of them working, nearly all their income goes to child care and rent. They budget and they try not to eat out too much, but they still feel that it's impossible to have much left in terms of their savings. They also don't see themselves becoming homeowners in their lifetime. They're among that 70 per cent that have lost faith in the ability to do that. So there's an overwhelming sense from them about the hopelessness of it. I think of Sandra, who's in her 50s, and her husband, who's 60 and working full time. Sandra has had to stop working recently because of rheumatoid arthritis and other health conditions. Both Sandra and her husband have never been able to save enough for a deposit to buy a home of their own. They've always lived in rentals and worried about how they will live as they age. Sandra said they would do anything to have a secure home to live in until they don't need it anymore. She said that they don't care if the government has equity in the home. That's what she said to me. She said: 'I'll take it. If this is going to change what I've experienced over decades, I will take that.' They were very grateful for and appreciative of that change. When we're talking about this, how can it be that here in Australia, blessed as we are with prosperity and wealth, we allow a scenario to develop in which a family with both parents in work, or two adults who both worked into their 50s, regard it as impossible to ever own a home? This has to change. This is fundamentally not acceptable. That's why we're passing this bill in this place. I would call on those who are seeking to oppose it or who have said that they would oppose it to think of those people for whom this would make a difference in their lives. Think of the people who will actually have an enormous change to their lives because of the impacts that this legislation will have on them, to allow them to get into that homeownership—the 40,000 Australians whose lives it will change for the better. Think about those people. When all of us come to this chamber, we have a purpose. We have a purpose to make a difference to people's lives—to make the lives of Australians better. I don't think it's too idealistic to say that I want an Australia where housing is a fundamental human right, and we can start with helping people as much as we can to get into homeownership. This is what this bill is about. Rather than grandstanding and politicising the issue, rather than jumping up and down, trying to get the meme and the photo opportunity and all the rest of it, this is about a piece of legislation that will change 40,000 lives for the better and get them into homeownership. An Australia I want is one where housing is affordable, where housing is accessible and where young people can buy a home. Inheritance can't be the only way that Australians finally get to experience homeownership. As I stated at the beginning of this speech, every so often we're presented with the policies that provide us with an opportunity to fundamentally address a problem in a way which will shape the future of the country. We've passed a lot of bills in this place in the last year and a half on housing, whether it's the HAFF, the Help to Buy Scheme or all the other things that I've gone through in my remarks. And we've seen, consistently, opposition from the coalition and from the Greens political party. The HAFF was one example, and they finally changed their mind on that. Every so often, issues of such profound magnitude arise, and it's up to us to address them. It's up to us to make that difference, and this is one of them. This bill is one of them—a moment that defines the future of the people in our nation and actually makes a difference to their lives. This government is taking serious action to do that, to make it easier for Australians to own their very own home. I call on those who are saying that they will oppose this to think again about the people that this will impact and the lives that will be made better because of this legislation. The government are trying to pull the wool over your eyes and crush your hope that they are capable of doing anything real or substantial to tackle the housing crisis. What do we make of a parliament and a government in 2024—with millions of people struggling to pay the rent or struggling to pay their mortgages, giving up on ever being able to buy a home—when the one piece of housing legislation that the government brings to this parliament, the Help to Buy Bill 2023, is going to screw over 99.8 per cent of renters? They're going to set up a sick lottery. If you're a renter watching at home right now and you're thinking, 'Oh, I'd love to be able to buy a home,' guess what? The government's only solution this year is one where you spin a wheel and, 99.8 per cent of the time, you lose. The gall of this government to get up and say that it cares about people suffering at the moment and about people struggling to pay their rent, when 75 per cent of the members of this government own investment properties! It's quite incredible. They are also supporting massive tax handouts for property investors that are denying millions of renters the chance ever to buy a home. One of the remarkable things we heard from the housing minister, which she said repeatedly, was: 'Our ambitious housing reform agenda is working across the board.' Tell that to the renters right now who are one rent increase away from eviction. Rents, by the way, are increasing at almost double the rate of wages. Tell that to the pensioner who emailed our office and said: 'I just copped two $50-a-week increases, six months apart, and now I'm on $100 a week. That's what I'm trying to survive on now, after rent.' Tell them that the housing agenda is working across the board. Again, the housing minister says, 'Our ambitious housing reform agenda is working across the board.' Tell that to the single mum I doorknocked over the weekend, who has copped another massive rent increase. She said to me, 'I'm skipping meals at the moment because I can't afford the rent and I really want to be able to afford my baby's nappy rash cream.' This is such a wealthy country, but it's so clear that the government wants to crush people's expectations that it's capable of doing anything other than tinkering around the edges. I'll tell you what those opposite are capable of doing. They are capable of dishing out $39 billion a year in tax handouts for property investors. They are capable of giving tax handouts to property developers to build to rent. I'll tell you about the latest build-to-rent project that the government supports down in Melbourne: one-third of the tenants were evicted by the private property developer, and the apartments were re-advertised with jacked up rents. Can anyone guess who this government appointed to the head of its National Housing Supply and Affordability Council, the body that's meant to advise the government on dealing with the housing crisis? It's the outgoing CEO of Mirvac, one of the largest property developers in this country. Let's talk about Mirvac for a moment. They also did a build-to-rent project. They advertised it in Sydney with rents that were 20 per cent above market rent. I'll tell you who the government's solution to the housing crisis is being applauded by. The Property Council—the head of the property developers in Australia—are really happy with the government's response. The banks are really happy with the government's response. The minister says, 'This ambitious housing reform agenda is working across the board.' I bet who it's really working for right now is the Commonwealth Bank, who just reported a record $10 billion profit. It is working for property developers, who get extra handouts from the government. It is working for the 75 per cent of Labor members over there who are property investors, who benefit from the massive tax handouts that property investors get, which are driving up house prices in this country and screwing over millions of people. Let's be very clear: we just had a Labor member in this place talking about how, post World War II, there was a really big improvement in housing affordability. There were three things happening then that this government could do right now. They have the power to do it, and if they tell you they don't they are lying to you. Firstly, cap and freeze rent increases. Right now, rents are increasing at close to double the rate of wages. The only way to stop that right now and give people relief is by putting a cap and a freeze on rent increases. Secondly, we could phase out the massive tax handouts for property investors. This is what those tax handouts mean. You go to an auction. You've been saving for years. You've been making sacrifices and giving up meals just to save up enough for a deposit. You go to the auction, and there's a property investor there, with thousands of dollars of tax handouts from this Labor government in their pocket. They bid up the price of the house and you get screwed. I speak to wealthy parents in my electorate who say, 'My kid will never be able to buy a home.' Finally, if they phased out those tax handouts for property investors, they could spend billions of dollars building public housing. Do you know how many public homes this country could build if we phased out those massive tax handouts? Half a million homes. That would come close to ending the shortfall of public housing in this country. Think about the millions of lives that we could change right now in this place if this government had the guts to stand up to the banks, the property developers and the massive property investors, who are the main beneficiaries of this broken housing system. Let's talk about this Help to Buy scheme that the government loves to talk about. You'll notice that they say, 'This is a scheme that's going to help people to buy a house.' They conveniently always forget to mention that it will only help 0.2 per cent of renters every year. For the other 99.8 per cent of renters, it will drive up the cost of housing. Don't ask the Greens, though. Here are two different senior economists—two radical lefties, by the way. One is Saul Eslake, former ANZ chief economist and notable radical leftie. Commenting on the New South Wales shared-equity scheme, he said, 'Anything that allows first home buyers to pay more for housing than they otherwise would will result in higher house prices and, as a result, lower homeownership rates.' Another radical lefty, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver, echoed this, arguing that bringing forward demand for housing risks worsening the crisis. The Prime Minister said, 'The New South Wales shared-equity scheme is working really well.' Well, last year there were 3,000 places in that shared-equity scheme. Can anyone take a guess at how many people took advantage of it? One hundred and seventy-two. That is a 95 per cent fail rate. It's almost comical. It would be comical if it were not for the fact that this government has the power to lift millions of people out of rental and housing stress and is instead lying to people. They get up and they say, 'We're about caring about people being able to afford a home,' but they absolutely know that this scheme will not lift the millions of people who are in desperate need of help right now out of housing and rental stress. Over the last 10 years, house prices in Australia have doubled. On average, every year after these massive tax handouts for property investors were introduced by John Howard—a John Howard policy, by the way, that now the Labor Party supports; when people say they can't tell the difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party these days, God only knows why—house prices on average have gone up three times faster than wages every single year. Now we have a situation where people are telling us, 'We can't afford the rent,' and the government say, 'We're going to lock in unlimited rent increases.' We have a situation where people are saying, 'I can't afford a home,' and the government are introducing a bill to drive up house prices even faster. People are saying, 'I'm waiting 10 years to get into a public home,' and the government are saying, 'No more money for public housing.' They wonder why people are upset and frustrated. I think members of this government are missing a beat. I don't think they understand how angry, disappointed and frustrated people are right now. The only asset this government has is that people have low expectations about what politics can achieve. That is why I think the government repeatedly comes out and says: 'No, we can't do that. No, we can't change those tax handouts, even though they were only introduced by Howard just after 2000 with the capital gains tax discount.' They will come out and say, 'No, we can't build any more public housing,' even though housing construction starts right now are at a 10-year low. This is what's remarkable about the government. The government will say, 'There are not construction materials or workers to build any more public housing,' even though there are a lot of materials and workers sitting idle because they have overseen a housing system that, when they talk about supply, has reached a 10-year low. We could put that construction material and those workers to work building thousands and thousands of new public homes, which could be built, by the way, with money we save from no longer giving massive property investors huge tax handouts. But the government say, 'No, we're not going to be able to do that.' This is despite the fact that, as they know, post World War II was the only time in Australian history where we saw big increases in home ownership, when we capped and froze rents. They also know that they could coordinate that through national cabinet, and yet they refuse. The reasons they refuse are—because, really, when it comes down to it, who does this government act in the interests of?—property investors, the banks and property developers. How do you know that they do that? Don't look at what they say; look at what they do: unlimited rent increases, refusing to build any more public housing, protecting tax handouts for massive property investors and trying to ram a bill through this House, a bill which even conservative economists say will drive up the price of housing. It's genuinely remarkable. What's really frustrating is one of the lies they try to tell: 'Give us some time'— The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Vasta ): Order! The member for Griffith will withdraw that remark. Dr Aly: The member has continually made aspersions on the government that are unparliamentary, and he should withdraw. Mr CHANDLER-MATHER: I withdraw. One of the things that the government likes to say that is patently not true is that they really care about tackling this housing crisis. What has become clear as well is that they also like to tell people, 'Give us time.' It's easy for members of the government to say, 'Give us time,' when 75 per cent of them own property investments. It's easy for members of the government to say, 'Give us time,' when, at minimum, they're earning $200,000 a year. How long does the single mum one rent increase away from eviction have to wait? How long does the person who has been waiting 10 years to get into a public home have to wait? How long does the couple, who have been spending years trying to save up for a home only to find that house prices have increased so fast the deposit isn't enough anymore, have to wait? Why is it that in this country, in this parliament, it is always the people doing it tough who have to wait the longest? And why is it that, in this country, property developers, banks and property investors don't even have to wait a day? They don't have to wait a day. I think people in this country are sick and tired of a political system so stacked in favour of property investors, banks and property developers. They can see it with their own eyes. They can see it in the homes that property developers leave vacant to help drive up the price of housing. They can see it in the fact that the government is dishing out $39 billion a year to property investors while refusing to spend a single extra cent on public housing. They can see it in the fact that their children are giving up on ever being able to buy a home. They can see it in the fact that tents are appearing in parks across this country. They can see it in the fact that record numbers of homeless people are being turned away from homelessness services because they don't have enough money to help people or enough homes to put them in—in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Frankly, the entire political class should be ashamed that we have overseen a system in this country where, at the same time as property investors get billions of dollars in tax handouts, this government claims it doesn't have enough money for public housing, it can't do anything about unlimited rent increases and it's not going to touch massive tax handouts for property investors. The bottom line is this. There are five million renters in this country, and there are millions more people—like parents of those renters—right now who know that this country is manifestly unfair and stacked against them, and they are getting sick and tired of being treated like second-class citizens. Come the next election, I think this government is going to be in for a rude shock when it realises it can no longer keep putting the interests of property developers, property moguls and banks ahead of renters, first home buyers and mortgage holders. I think people are getting pretty sick and tired of it. If you thought what happened in Brisbane in 2022 was an arbitrary thing, if you thought that, when we won Griffith, Brisbane and Ryan and when we saw massive swings to the Greens, it was just a one-off, wait till you see what happens when you go to an election and you say your platform is unlimited rent increases for renters, no more money for public housing and locking in tax handouts for property investors. When the only bill this parliament has to deal with the housing crisis this year is one that will screw over 99.8 per cent of renters and drive up house prices, let's see what happens at the next election, because I reckon people are going to be pretty fed up.","Help to Buy Bill 2023, Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(17:08):"

"0","0","0","1","1","0","413","Aly, Anne MP","13050","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I can definitely say that the shrill hysteria of the Greens is not going to fix the housing crisis, but supply will, and that is our sole focus. We are focused on supply because supply has been declining in this country. We have a constrained pool of housing and an increasing number of people who are seeking homeownership, and we just do not have enough homes for those people. So the answer is actually to build, and to reduce and address the barriers to building, more homes across this country—in the regions, in the cities and in our metropolitan areas.  Unlike the Greens political party, we are not here to carve up this country and divide it. We have a mission, and our mission is to address the crisis of homeownership right throughout this nation—a crisis that was born in the decade of neglect under the Liberal Party. They had nine years, nearly a decade, to fix this problem, and what did they do? They simply vacated the space. In fact, the number of dwellings that were built peaked in 2016, and they've been declining ever since. The Liberal Party could have pulled the handbrake. They could have sat down with the state governments and actually worked towards finding a solution, but instead they walked away. They washed their hands of the problem. They pointed to the states and they said, 'It's your problem; you deal with it.' And when we came to power we found that, in the aftermath of the pandemic, housing occupancy patterns have changed. People are choosing to live in single-occupancy homes and, as a result, we actually need more homes. There's only one solution to all of this. When you cut through all the noise and the hysteria and the rage—or the faux rage, or whatever it is—and the finger-pointing, the only answer is supply, and that is what the Albanese Labor government is focused on. Indeed, we are pumping in $25 billion over the next 10 years to improve housing in this country. It is the sole focus because we understand housing is foundational. It is foundational to security, and security is foundational to prosperity. You cannot prosper in life, you cannot lay down roots and you cannot grow and thrive unless you have a roof over your head. Rents, we understand, are increasingly eating up disposable income. Many Australians are looking to buy. In the 12 months to January 2024, rents on apartments increased in Melbourne by 15 per cent, in Armadale by 15 per cent, in Prahran by 21 per cent and in South Yarra by 22 per cent. According to the Grattan Institute's 2022 The great Australian nightmare report, between 1981 and 2021 homeownership rates for 25- to 34-year-olds in the two lowest quintiles by household income, meaning these were lower-income earners, fell from 57 per cent to 28 per cent. Similarly, for 45- to 54-year-olds in the same two quintiles, meaning lower-income earners, homeownership rates also declined from 71 per cent to 53 per cent. From the same report, homeownership is also falling amongst poorer, older Australians. Among the poorest 40 per cent of 45- to 54-year-olds, just 53 per cent own their homes today, down from 71 per cent four decades ago. In the past few decades, house prices have skyrocketed. While average full-time earnings have doubled over the past half-century, house prices have quadrupled. Consequently, it takes much longer today to save for a deposit. That's a fact. In the early 1990s it would take the average Australian about seven years to save a 20 per cent deposit for a typical dwelling. Now it takes almost 12 years. We want to make homeownership easier, we want to make it a reality and we have the tools to do so. The Help to Buy scheme is a plank in the Albanese government's raft of reforms aimed at addressing housing affordability. It directly addresses the time it takes to save for a deposit and the high cost of repayments as a proportion of your income. Help to Buy could make homeownership a reality with as little as a two per cent deposit. As a shared-equity scheme, Help to Buy will bring homeownership back into reach for 40,000 Australian households—10,000 per year over the next four years. The government will support eligible homebuyers with an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes which are moderately priced. In Higgins that means any home below $850,000. Homeowners will need a minimum of a two per cent deposit to participate in the scheme, greatly reducing the burden of scrimping and saving. And you will have lower ongoing mortgage repayments. The financial risks and benefits are shared between the homeowner and the Commonwealth. To be clear, the government will not be a co-owner of the property. Rather, the government will have a second mortgage over the property. This means that homebuyers will not have to pay rent or interest to the government. Rather, the government will take its share of the profits when the home is sold. In other words, if the government contributes 30 per cent of the purchase price, it will receive 30 per cent of the sale price when the house is sold. Together, these measures will provide long-term relief. So who can apply? You have to be an Australian citizen who is at least 18 years of age, yearly income must be $90,000 or less for individuals or $120,000 or less for couples, so we are targeting this towards people on the lower- and middle-income ends of the spectrum. This cap is lower than the Home Guarantee Scheme, as it is designed to support that cohort of people. You must live in the purchased home and you must not currently own any other land or property in Australia or overseas, but it certainly doesn't have to be your first home. While the required minimum is a two per cent deposit of the home price, the purchaser must be able to finance the remainder of the loan. You also have to prove that you can pay all the associated upfront costs, which are considerable and are barriers to homeownership. They include stamp duty, which is enacted by the states, along with legal fees and bank fees. You will also be responsible for ongoing costs associated with the property such as rates, strata and electricity bills. Each state's allocation will be available to eligible residents on a first come, first served basis, so you have to apply quickly. You've got to get your ducks in order and get your financing sorted out. Details such as whether participants are able to renovate their homes—they can—and the situation when a home is sold are already in place. At National Cabinet in August last year all states agreed to progress Help to Buy so that the scheme can run nationally. In other words, the states are ready and waiting. They are ready to press the go button on this, provided that we get support in the parliament. Right now, the Greens have formed yet another unholy alliance with the coalition, blocking this scheme from coming into practice, while Australians are living in tent cities, while we have young people desperate for homeownership who are spinning their wheels renting. This kind of behaviour is actually unconscionable. Housing ministers from across the country have recommitted to this agreement. This means that the only potential barriers to the passage of the scheme sit on the crossbench and among the Libs. We on this side of the House have rejected the divisive federal-state antics that were the signature of the wasted decade under the Liberals because the scale of the problem is too great. Help to Buy is one aspect of the Albanese government's comprehensive response to the housing affordability crisis. Ours is a multipronged approach that addresses the huge challenges facing renters in finding accommodation and the high cost of rents, shortages of social housing as well as barriers to homeownership. Our broad housing agenda is squarely focused on supply, and it includes a plethora of measures. The Housing Australia Future Fund, a $10 billion fund aimed at building 30,000 social and affordable homes, has now been stood up. Note, however, that this was delayed by six months due to, again, another unholy alliance between the Liberals and the Greens. It seems that the two parties of the extremes have merged and are basically now a barrier to homeownership and home supply in this country. The National Housing Accord commits us, in partnership with the states and industry, including super funds and construction, to build a million homes over five years. We have a new national target to build 1.2 million well-located homes. We've launched the $3 billion New Homes Bonus and the $500 million Housing Support Program There's the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator to deliver around 4,000 new social homes across Australia. This includes a new build of social, affordable and market rentals in Bangs Street, Prahran, in my electorate, which I have visited with Premier Jacinta Allan and our housing minister, Julie Collins. There were fantastic homes—new, warm, comfortable, safe. An investment of an additional $1 billion in the National Housing Infrastructure Facility has been made to support more homes. Up to $575 million in funding has already been unlocked, and homes are being built with this money. We've increased the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent, the largest increase in more than 30 years. I could go on and on because there are another six or seven measures we have included. One, notably, is that we expanded the Home Guarantee Scheme, which has already helped 100,000 people across Australia into homeownership, and we relaxed some of the eligibility criteria around the scheme, allowing parents, relatives or legal guardians to assist with the purchase of homes. The housing crisis will take time to solve, and building more homes is the only answer to declining affordability and rising rents. Increasing supply means more construction workers, materials, industry expertise and cutting red tape. Rather than vilifying property developers, we recognise that property developers are absolutely needed to address this crisis, because this is of a scale that governments cannot spend their way through. Twenty-five billion dollars is a lot of money, but we do need the private sector in order to build those apartments as quickly as possible, and we do need the states to step up and cut the red tape so that we can get these homes built fast. Workforce is a pressing issue, and that's where our free TAFE courses for urgent skills, like construction, kick in. I need young people who may be looking for career options to check out the offerings at TAFE. We are fortunate to have Holmesglen TAFE on our doorstep, a fantastic place of learning linked to career pathways in well-paid, secure jobs. By directly addressing the problems of saving for a deposit and the cost of repayments, the Help to Buy scheme will be life-changing for thousands of Australians who have been locked out of the security and stability of homeownership. We are in a housing emergency, and I know one thing about managing emergencies: you don't just do one thing; you do everything. You come at the problem from multiple directions to rescue the patient. Right now we are in a housing crisis, and our multipronged strategy, which is broad based and comes at this problem from every angle, addressing skills, supply chain, red tape and capital, is the way to solve the problem, not by carving up Australia and dividing it and pitting one generation against the other. I commend this bill to the House.  I rise today to speak on the Help to Buy Bill 2023. You know, the word 'help' is interesting. When I got into federal politics, I was determined to make a difference. I wanted to stand up for the people of Dawson. I wanted to do my best for Australia, because I believe Australia is the best country in the world, and I just want to be able to make it that little bit better. That's what I'm here to do. But, for close to two years now, I've been watching the Albanese Labor government fail to do anything to help hardworking Australians. In fact, what I've seen instead is that those opposite prefer to make it look like they're doing something. However, they're doing very little.  Take this Help to Buy Bill, for example. This piece of legislation was a key election policy put forward by the Albanese Labor government back in 2022. The Albanese Labor government promised to deliver this Help to Buy scheme by 1 January 2023. But, like we've seen, this is just another broken promise in a long list of broken promises. That includes, remember, the promised $275 reduction in our power bills. What's happened with power? It's gone up over 20 per cent. But this wasn't a slip of the tongue; this promise was repeated 97 times. We've seen increased taxes. We've seen higher interest rates—interest rates have gone up 12 times under the watch of those opposite. We've seen rent increases. What else have we seen? We've seen infrastructure cuts—cuts to dam funding, roads and just about anything. I don't know what those opposite have got against rural and regional Australia, but their policies certainly do nothing for us. Blind Freddy can see that the promises made by the Albanese Labor government are worthless. The Prime Minister said, 'My word is my bond.' What a crock! It's now the end of February 2024, and this piece of unhelpful legislation has only just made its way to the House. It is clearly a long way from being delivered. What has the housing minister been doing? You could forgive the Australian people for asking what the Labor government and the housing minister have been doing. The fact is that this bill is only just arriving in the House over a year after it should have commenced. That's appalling. What have the Prime Minister and his government been doing? We can thank them for the Labor-created cost-of-living crisis. Tick! We can thank them for spending billions of dollars on a failed referendum during a cost-of-living crisis. Tick! We can thank them for the national housing crisis that's leaving so many Aussies displaced with nowhere to go, forcing them to sleep in tents, in their cars or even on the street. Tick! We can also thank them for failing to explain to the Australian public that this key election promise and piece of legislation requires state government approval to operate. This means that the Albanese Labor government has made yet another promise it can't necessarily keep. We can also thank those opposite for copying and pasting a scheme that already exists at the state level and that's so unwanted by Australians that there are many places remaining in the state based schemes. For the piece de resistance, in true Labor government style, they have released a piece of proposed legislation so devoid of detail that everyone is left scratching their heads, with more questions than we've received answers. Here's what we do know. Right now, we have housing approvals and builds at record lows. Rents are skyrocketing. Vacancy rates are nosediving. House prices are at an all-time high, and the stock that is available is being snapped up before the house even hits the market. A year after the scheme should have started, we get this pitiful offering. It's embarrassing. It's nothing more than a box-ticking exercise so the Albanese Labor government can be seen to be doing something when, really, those opposite are doing nothing at all. The Help to Buy scheme is an incredibly limited and niche shared-equity product with only 40,000 places available. The details on how many of these places will be available in each state and territory are yet to be shared by the Labor government. The Help to Buy scheme would also mean that the Australian government would own up to 40 per cent of your family home, which is probably why these places are still available in each of the state based schemes. I know that in my electorate of Dawson people think of their home as their castle. It's where you spend your time. It's where you make your happiest moments. It's where you raise your children and watch them grow into adults. The purchase of your first home and the all-consuming feeling of pride that you get from standing in front of the 'Sold' sign and having your picture taken is a memory and a feeling that no-one ever forgets. I don't know a single person who wants the Australian government standing in that picture with them. I don't know anyone who wants to skip hand in hand with the Australian government down the path to the first front door that they have ever owned. I don't know of anyone. This policy beggars belief. Why would hardworking Aussies want the Australian government owning 40 per cent of something they have worked so hard for? I asked this question of a hardworking tradie last night, and the answer I got in return requires a language warning. I abide by the rules of the House, so I won't repeat it. The majority of Australians are just like this tradie. They don't want the Australian government having any part in owning their home. They don't want Prime Minister Albanese or Minister Julie Collins sitting around their kitchen table with them. They don't want those opposite sitting in their lounge room, watching TV with them after a long day, or helping them to get their kids ready for school in the morning. They don't want them hanging around during the reading of the will, with their bank details ready, waiting for their cut in the family home. The people of Australia don't want their children's inheritance to go to the Australian government. They want to know that their children and their children's children are going to be looked after. It can't be any simpler than that. They don't want the government there. After waiting for so long for the details of this bill, that's about all we know. For anyone interested in applying for the Help to Buy scheme, the very first question they would ask is, 'Am I eligible?' I could confidently say, 'I can't answer that question.' At this point, we shouldn't be left with wishy-washy details on what the eligibility criteria are. Those opposite need to give us the detail. Everyone remembers the purchase of their first home. Everyone remembers the feeling of starting their first round of home renovations.

Mr WILLCOX: It is probably the best feeling in the world at the time, and, boy, is it exciting. Maybe they've bought their dream home, but the garden wasn't up to standard. It doesn't even matter, because the excitement of starting that first landscaping project overrules everything. Amongst the excitement, though, this bill leaves the people of Australia with more questions than answers, such as: What do they do now if they own only 60 per cent of their home? Would they have to get approval to complete major works on their own property? Can they send the invoice of 40 per cent of the costs to the Prime Minister—who has now joined us? What about the landscaping? If you buy a house and you start to do some landscaping on it, are those costs going to be added? Do they have to be reimbursed? What about maintenance? What about the effort that you put in, if you plant trees, if you work on your whole property? Is that going to be part of this? What about natural disasters?","Help to Buy Bill 2023, Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[10]","N/A","N/A"

Mr WILLCOX: What happens in the north when cyclones come through? This scheme is targeted towards low- and middle-income earners. I know a few families living on low and middle incomes who wouldn't be able to afford the cost of repairs following a cyclone. With the cost of insurance for northern Australia at the moment, they would have to be extremely fortunate to even have insurance, let alone receive a payout for repairs. Let's say that, by some miracle, they can pass the cost on to the Prime Minister. The people of Australia could be left waiting over a year for the repair bills to be paid, just like they've waited over a year for this bill. It's disappointing that this bill is only being debated now, over a year after those opposite had promised it would have been implemented and started. There is so much detail that should be confidently given in answer to these questions so I can go back to the people of Dawson. Instead, we get the copied and pasted answer we've heard from this government the whole way along. 'It will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.' That's reassuring, eh? Let's look at the coalition record. The coalition brought in the Home Guarantee Scheme, which is now supporting one in three homebuyers. The Housing Guarantee Scheme consists of the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, the New Home Guarantee and the Family Home Guarantee. The coalition also brought in the First Home Super Saver Scheme and the homebuilder grant during the COVID pandemic and established the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. All of these were designed and developed to empower every single person in Australia to be able to buy their first home with their own money, the money that they have worked hard for. A coalition government does not want a stake in your family home. A coalition government wants to empower the people of Australia to be able to purchase their own home with their own money. A coalition government wants every Australian to have the means to feel that sense of pride, that sense of accomplishment, that excitement when they step into their first home. A coalition government does not kick people out of their home if they earn over a wage cap. A coalition government doesn't sit there, waiting for 40 per cent of your profits after years of appreciation on the property after you sell it. A coalition government doesn't inflate prices by more than the subsidy values in areas where they are most needed, like we found in the UK when they introduced a scheme similar to the Help to Buy bill. A coalition government empowers the people of Australia to enter the housing market knowing that they own their own house and the government cannot take it away from them. A coalition government empowers the people of Australia to invest in themselves. The Albanese Labor government is becoming the dodgiest property investor that Australia has ever seen. This Help to Buy scheme is late. It's another broken promise. It lacks detail. You must have known after the referendum that Australians want detail. They want the detail on their policies so they can make an informed decision. We've got the Prime Minister here. Please, the best thing you can do, Prime Minister, is get rid of this legislation.","Help to Buy Bill 2023, Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[13]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","1","0","422","DEPUTY SPEAKER, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","What a sad contribution from the member opposite. Here they are, opposing something that was a clear commitment that we made at the election—a clear commitment announced at our campaign launch and a key part of what is a comprehensive housing agenda that we have, building more homes through our National Housing Accord Facility; working with states and territories to speed up approvals and boost supply, which is they key; investing in public housing, something those opposite will never do; new construction and renovation; strengthening renters' rights; and the Help to Buy plan, of course, an important component about helping families buy a home of their own, about investing in the dreams of Australian families, which have been so important as part of the Australian story. They are people who have worked hard, saved up and made sacrifices but need a little extra help getting a deposit together and getting the start that they need. This is consistent with our approach. We want people to earn more, and that's why we've seen real wages lift in 2023—much earlier than Treasury said that they would. That's why we want people to keep more of what they earn. Our tax cuts, aimed squarely as low- and middle-income workers, will do that as well.  Help to Buy is a pretty simple scheme. It's one that, for the member opposite to be informed, operates effectively not just in places like Western Australia but, indeed, in other markets around the world. What it will mean is that our government steps up and takes a share of the equity. It opens the door to homeownership to tens of thousands of hardworking people. The member asked for detail. Here it is. Under this legislation, if you've saved two per cent of your deposit—he doesn't want to stay and listen—the government will contribute up to 40 per cent of the purchase price for a new home, thereby encouraging construction, or 30 per cent for an existing home. It's a pretty simple proposal. Then, down the track, the purchaser can buy back, off the government, full ownership of their home. It is a pretty simple system that works very effectively, but what it does, obviously, is reduce the amount that people need for a deposit and then reduce the amount of their payments. So, if a home is worth half a million dollars, and 40 per cent of that, $200,000, is equity from the government, then you're paying off a loan based upon $300,000 of borrowing, rather than the $500,000. I know that shouldn't be too hard for those opposite to work out, but they actually don't want government to pay a role in public housing. They don't want government to play a role in homeownership either. We've heard a lot of talk from the Liberals in recent weeks about aspiration. We know, from the tax debate, that their idea of aspiration is just people at the top end. Their idea is that people who are working, low- and middle-income earners, aren't aspirational; they should just know their place in life and just stay there. That's not our approach. Our approach is to open up those doors of opportunity, and that's what this is about. But here, of course, we have a new 'no-alition' between the Liberals and the Greens political party. It's extraordinary. Owning a home is about a sense of security, confidence, stability and belonging—a foundation on which you can build a better future for yourself and your family. And every member from the Labor Party of this House is proud to vote for this legislation. It's another positive step in our plan to increase homeownership. This is what people have said, though, about this. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, has said that it's 'not liberating, it's modern collectivism'. This is another example of the creeping collectivism going across policies. But this is what David Crisafulli, the Queensland LNP leader, said in November 2020: We will prioritise building an incentive framework to support home ownership, examining areas including first home-owner grant and shared responsibility schemes. Jeremy Rockliff, the Liberal Premier, spoke about his successful MyHome shared-equity program, which helps Tasmanians build or purchase a property. Dominic Perrottet, the former New South Wales Liberal Premier, said: Key workers, single parents and older singles will be able to have the security of homeownership … on the Government's equity share in a property. Right across the board. Matt Kean, the former New South Wales Liberal Treasurer, said this shared-equity scheme 'will help those facing significant barriers to homeownership buy their own place sooner'. The former South Australian Liberal Treasurer, Rob Lucas, said, 'We announced HomeStart shared-equity starter loans, and we expanded on that again.' Right across the board. Mia Davies, the former Leader of the Opposition over in WA, said this: 'I would also point out that, in 2010, it was a Liberal-National government leading the way nationally with shared equity.' Right across the board. What did the Liberals say about their policy of raiding super? Malcolm Turnbull, on 12 March 2015, said it was: … a thoroughly bad idea … That is not what the superannuation system is designed to achieve. The current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, said on 13 April 2017: 'I think Malcolm Turnbull has got it right.' Those are words that he didn't often say! He said, 'It's not good policy and I agree with him. Then Sussan Ley, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in 2017 said: Young people need their super for retirement, not to try to take pressure off an urban housing bubble … Michael Sukkar, the member for Deakin, the current Liberal spokesperson, in 2017 said: If all a government does is try to pump further liquidity into the residential housing market, inevitably all you do is push up housing prices. Mathias Cormann, in 2014, when he was the finance minister of the Liberal Party, said: Increasing the amount of money going into real estate by facilitating access to super savings pre-retirement will not improve housing affordability. The truth is that they are all over the shop. Historically, they didn't even support any of the things that they are putting forward now. But it's not just the Liberals. If it were just the Liberals without their 'no-alition' partner, the Greens, it could go through the Senate. There's been a lot of talk about policy. Here's what the Greens took to the last election and what they have a mandate for. This is from their 2022 election platform: In a property market rigged for investors, buying a home has become out of reach for an entire generation. This is why the Greens will establish a Shared Equity Ownership Scheme … Newsflash for the Greens: they are not in a position to establish anything because they are not the government. All they're in a position to do is to vote for this government's proposal which is completely in accord with their policy. But their housing spokesperson, the member for Griffith, went on Insiders a couple of weeks ago and said: 'We have enough homes for people to live in.' So the problem's solved! Don't worry about supply. It's just absolutely extraordinary. When it comes to the proposal, one of the things that the member for Griffith has said in changing his rhetoric is: You shouldn't have to win a lottery to have a secure home. That was in saying this doesn't apply to enough people. But his own website says: 'An example of the Greens' vision for housing in Brisbane is 2,000 homes available to any Brisbane resident and assigned by lottery.' I kid you not! That is beaten by the Leader of the Greens. They're opposing our investment in public housing. They opposed the Housing Australia Future Fund for so long. On public housing, when we announced the first Social Housing Accelerator program with former premier Daniel Andrews in Carlton, replacing 196 derelict, vacant public housing units with 231 new ones, the $2 billion that we announced in June, the Victorian Greens opposed the plan. They called it the end of public housing in the state. So building more public housing in the state of Victoria was a bad thing, according to them. The member for Melbourne told the House: North Melbourne's and Carlton's towers will be the first to go. People will be kicked out of their homes within the next few years. It is wrong to destroy these vibrant and diverse communities. The people there have a right to a home—a public home. That sounds okay except that there is no-one there because they're derelict. There are currently no residents in the Carlton towers because they're unlivable because they were built decades ago. What we're doing with our $2 billion is upgrading them into more homes for public housing, with newer residents—many of whom who have had to move out over a period of time because the towers are derelict, just like many of the old towers in Waterloo in Sydney are no longer fit for purpose. This is housing built 50 years ago that is simply not up to scratch. We in the Labor Party believe that people who live in public housing should live in quality public housing, and that is what our $2 billion is about. The Greens, instead, called for the derelict, vacant apartments to just be refurbished, an idea that the CEO of Homes Victoria dismissed as 'putting lipstick on a pig'. The member for Brisbane, who of course will speak at some stage here as well, is also opposing a build-to-rent project in his electorate that would create 349 apartments. The site is currently a vacant lot. It is 200 metres from a major train station and walking distance from the Brisbane CBD. But, in his letter opposing the development, the member claims: Brisbane residents are fed up with developers claiming they are addressing the housing crisis by 'increasing supply' … I'm not sure how he thinks houses, units and apartments are built, but I'll give him a big tip: they require builders and they require investment. Build-to-rent projects are pretty sensible. The member for Ryan, not to be outdone, is campaigning against a plan to subdivide a chicken farm into 91 new homes. The developer is the Uniting Church. In her letter to Brisbane City Council, claiming that the Uniting Church was not responding to community concerns, it said, 'It would diminish the natural character of the site.' It's a chook farm! Between the Liberals, with their failure to support aspiration, and the Greens, with their failure to support anything at all—even their own policy in the platform—we have this 'no-alition' that will ensure that the coalition between the Liberals and the Greens, when it comes to opposing anything on housing, is an unholy one. It's one designed to just keep people in their place and not do anything to improve their circumstances. We on this side of the House support increasing housing supply as the key. Part of that is support for our build-to-rent tax incentives for the private sector. Part of that is our direct investment in public housing. Part of that as well is our incentive, particularly with a stronger incentive for new homes to be built, under Help to Buy. This is good policy. It should be going through this parliament. It is extraordinary that this coalition is combining to oppose it. But they'll be held to account for their opposition.  I rise to speak to the Help to Buy Bill 2023. This scheme is like throwing a bucket of water onto a house fire. This scheme acts like a lottery, with availability for just 0.2 per cent of those eligible. It should go without saying that Australians shouldn't have to win the lottery in order to have a secure home. What's more, this scheme adds to demand, not to supply. It's actually going to push up house prices even further for the other 99.8 per cent of us. This Labor government acknowledges that we're in the middle of a housing and rental crisis, and we are, but it responds with this. It's a smoke and mirrors policy to make it sound like something substantial is being done when, in practical reality, it's a drop in the ocean.  The median house price in greater Brisbane is fast approaching $1 million, and it's already well over that in my own electorate. We're at even greater risk of unaffordable housing worsening due to the upcoming 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, which have been shown to increase housing costs in host cities around the world. There are people lined up around the block for rental inspections with plenty of Australians now only one rental increase, one mortgage rate increase or one insurance rise away from homelessness. So where is the sense of urgency? It was just under two weeks ago that the housing minister walked around my question on negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions to instead speak about increasing supply as the golden ticket out of this housing crisis. Well, Minister, where is this increased supply? Recent ABS data shows that new housing commencements have hit a decade low and are predicted to keep dropping even further. In fact, Labor's own Housing Accord looks like it will fail to meet its own targets. The bottom line here is that Labor cannot keep expecting private property developers and banks to fix the housing crisis. The role of a private company is to make profit. Dramatically increasing supply to the extent that we actually need will reduce the profit margins of these companies. They're not going to do something that will reduce their profits. Property developers are not going to build enough houses to stabilise house prices, because they make more money the way things are. This Help to Buy scheme allows people to purchase existing homes. It's what's called a demand-side housing support. This type of assistance adds demand; not supply. Economists and the Productivity Commission alike agree that this type of assistance has the effect of pushing up house prices and, as a result, lowers homeownership overall. What's worse is that, even if the government wanted to increase the scheme beyond the measly 10,000 households it has at the moment, it would only worsen these inflationary impacts. It's called Help to Buy, but how will it actually help? There are over 4½ million renters in Australia who may be eligible for Labor's Help to Buy scheme, yet the scheme would only be available to 10,000 households a year. That means it would end up being available, as I said, to 0.2 per cent of those people while leaving behind the other 99.8 per cent. It goes without saying that this does not address the enormity of the housing crisis we are facing in this country. This bill gives no details on eligibility outside of income thresholds. Who of the 0.2 per cent are eligible? Who will be prioritised? Will certain regions be prioritised over others? Are there selection criteria? None of these questions are actually answered or addressed in this bill. In terms of current supply, what we're seeing in the market over and over again is property investors buying existing homes that could have been purchased by a renter as their first home, driving up the cost of housing and locking millions out of basic housing security. This cannot keep going unchecked. We saw during the GFC, in very recent memory, what happens when the housing market collapses as prices soar and the market destabilises. Change must happen. We cannot just wait for this bubble to pop and hope for the best. This is going to require a multifaceted approach beyond just increasing supply. The Greens are proposing to phase out the grossly unfair tax concessions, like negative gearing and capital gains taxes, for the government to directly invest that money into building affordable housing. Recent Parliamentary Budget Office modelling shows that, in total, property tax deductions and the capital gains tax discount for investment properties will cost the federal budget $38.9 billion in forgone revenue in this financial year. The latest Tax expendituresand insightsstatement outlines that the majority of the benefit of these tax handouts goes to the highest incomes. In fact, the top 30 per cent of income earners get 65 per cent of the benefits. It wasn't that long ago that we built tens of thousands of new public homes in this country, but now it's next to nothing. We're propping up property investors at the expense of people being able to call a home their own. This injustice is glaringly obvious, but, because Labor and the coalition are so beholden to their donors—to the banks and to property developers—we're led to believe that the status quo must be maintained and that we have no other option. The reality is that negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount mean that it is often easier for a property investor to buy their second, third, fourth or fifth home than it is for someone to buy their first. This is just incredibly, deeply unfair. How can these major party ghouls look in the face of young Australians, knowing that they are costing them their future of owning their own home? Without the ability for young people to own the roof over their head, how are the major parties expecting them to have any faith in our political or economic system? The Greens went to the 2022 federal election with a policy of phasing out negative gearing and mortgage interest deductibility for landlords with more than one investment property over the next five years, along with scrapping the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount, to be replaced with indexation of the asset cost. We could save billions by doing this and use these funds to mass build good-quality public homes in the same way that governments used to do in the 20th century. This is a commonsense remedy to get back to where we need to be. Just imagine: instead of billions of dollars going to property investors each year, we actually use the money to build houses. But we shouldn't have to imagine; we should have a government that actually does that. This Help to Buy proposal is the last of Labor's announced housing policies to enter this chamber. Is this really Labor's final effort to deal with the housing crisis before the next federal election? The Greens want people to be able to afford a home and be able to pay their rent. The reality is that more people are being locked out of homeownership than this scheme could ever remotely hope to address. More people are experiencing rental and mortgage stress and more people are being forced into homelessness. That's why the Greens are fighting for an end to unfair tax concessions for property investors and for a massive build of public housing. This is how we tackle the crisis, with the courage that the Australian people actually deserve. Labor's public refusal to negotiate on their housing lottery bill will be short lived. They cannot go to a federal election telling people that they did everything they could for housing when almost everyone feels worse off than they did three years ago. The Greens were able to secure $3 billion for public and community housing during our negotiations with the government on their previous housing bill, and I am hopeful that Labor will come to the table on this bill as well. Our communities are not asking for the world. They are asking for shelter—for the most basic of human rights—and for the government to have their back. Right now, there are millions of renters struggling to keep their heads above water. House prices are soaring. Mortgage rates are soaring. Times of crisis are when we expect our governments to step up, not tinker around with bandaid solutions that really do nothing and expect everyone to thank them for it. Australians deserve and need more than a housing lottery bill where 99.8 per cent of renters get nothing. Access to safe and secure housing is one of the most basic human rights according to the Australian Human Rights Commission. Alas, it's a right from which too many Australians are currently priced out. Over the decade to 2023, median house prices in Sydney rose from $615,000 to around $1.2 million. Housing stress is on the rise all around our country, and some 10 per cent of Australian households spent up to half their wages on housing in 2019, and that share keeps increasing. What those statistics hide is that it is mainly low- and middle-income households bearing the brunt of the housing crisis and being locked out of the market. New research by YouGov suggests that nine in 10 young Australians will never own their own home—the great Australian dream deferred, maybe for life.  This national trend has also hit the Northern Territory hard. In 2023, the median house price increased by 7.3 per cent in Darwin. As of December 2022, the NT had the equal second highest average rental price for a three-bedroom house. Darwin was the third most expensive capital to rent in Australia. Rental prices are now approaching the records set in Darwin in the 2010s. The Darwin Community Legal Service's head of tenants' advice, Matthew Gardiner, has been contacted by renters facing increases of more than $100 a week. He told the ABC that people 'basically are looking at moving interstate because there's nothing left here and they can't continue to stay here if there's nowhere to stay'. He says, 'It's really desperate times.' One of those people is local gardener Danielle Buxton, who rents in the Darwin suburb of Fannie Bay. She says: We live week-to-week, day-to-day, really … … … … I don't want to have to move out to ... somewhere cheaper and then disconnect myself from the community and the support network that I do have here … … … … But it's going to get to the point eventually where I probably will have to do something like that—or— worse— move home to Melbourne. Renting, let alone homeownership, has become extraordinarily difficult for far too many Territorians. While governments can't control market behaviour, they have an important role to play in improving housing affordability and availability. The Help to Buy scheme is just one of the ways that our government, the Albanese government, will help tens of thousands of low- and middle-income earners be able to afford to buy a home. Under a shared-equity scheme like this, the homebuyer shares the capital cost of purchasing a home with an equity partner, sharing the financial risks and benefits of that investment. This scheme will support up to 40,000 eligible Australians to purchase a home by providing an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent of the purchase price for new homes and up to 30 per cent for existing homes. It will be open to applications for four years, with 10,000 places available per year. The Help to Buy Bill 2023 gives Housing Australia the power to enter into these shared-equity arrangements. The scheme will give those on low and middle incomes an opportunity to buy a home with at least a two per cent deposit. This will allow them to access homeownership, which is linked to short-, medium- and long-term economic security, as all members understand. The scheme will help participants overcome both the hurdle of saving for a deposit and that of servicing a mortgage. We all know that these are some of the key barriers to homeownership. Help to Buy is designed to improve housing outcomes for Australians by reducing the upfront deposit hurdle and the ongoing mortgage repayments associated with purchasing a home. The scheme is intended to support Australians who otherwise would not be able to purchase a home. The government understands that safe and affordable housing is central to the security and, indeed, the dignity of all Australians and that many Australians are finding it hard to find an affordable place to buy. Not only have we got the difficulty of high rents and the barriers to buying but also it is often difficult to find an affordable place to buy. That's why the government has committed to an ambitious housing reform agenda, which includes establishing this Help to Buy scheme, to help more Australians into their own homes. As I said, this is just one pillar of our efforts. It is an important one though. With the Commonwealth providing an equity contribution, scheme participants will have lower ongoing repayments from a smaller home loan. The financial risk and benefit—that is, the capital gains and losses—will be shared between the participant and the Commonwealth, proportionate to their interests. So the taxpayer also gets some capital gains, as they should, for their investment. States will be required to pass legislation for the scheme to operate in their jurisdictions. But territories, like the NT, do not need to pass legislation. Places will be allocated between participating states and territories on a per capita basis. Each state's allocation will be available to eligible residents on a 'first come, first served' basis. I know many in my electorate are keen to go. Help to Buy aims to support Australians to achieve homeownership by enabling them to purchase moderately priced homes, with a price cap varying in each state. In the Northern Territory, the price of an eligible house will be capped at $600,000. You can build a good house for that. You can also buy a great existing property for that. The Help to Buy scheme is one element of the government's commitment to improving housing affordability. Our plan includes the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, the $3 billion Social Housing Accelerator payment and the largest increase to Commonwealth rental assistance in 30 years. In the Northern Territory, we also have a commitment to more housing for the homelands in remote areas of the Territory, which is important. The Albanese government has also helped more than 86,000 people across Australia into homeownership through the Home Guarantee Scheme, including 13,000 through the new Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee. So I reject the idea that there is any trade-off between Help to Buy, a very innovative policy to help alleviate the housing crisis for thousands of Australians, and assistance to renters. Housing experts have signalled that short-term measures like rent caps and freezes do not work and that they would have perverse outcomes, including a reduction in the number of properties available for rent. Help to Buy is aimed at supporting Australians, including renters, to purchase a home. We also continue to work with state, territory and local governments to deliver better housing options and outcomes, including for renters. At the National Cabinet in August last year, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments committed to a better deal for renters to harmonise and strengthen renters' rights across Australia. It was needed, and we did that. This included developing a framework for genuine reasonable grounds for eviction, moving towards limiting rental increases to once a year and phasing in minimum rental standards. These changes will have a real and tangible impact on the almost one-third of Australian households who rent. The government has delivered the largest increase to Commonwealth rent assistance in more than 30 years, as I mentioned, and that will assist low-income renters. National Cabinet agreed in August of last year to an ambitious new target to deliver 1.2 million new well-located homes over five years from 1 July this year. The Commonwealth is also providing $3 billion for the new homes bonus, a performance based payment to incentivise taken territories to undertake the reforms needed to help achieve this target. We are tackling the housing crisis on multiple fronts. The government understands that affordable housing is critical to economic wellbeing and is committed to supporting more Australians to access housing, which is why we took the Help to Buy Scheme to the election in 2022. I know that many in my electorate, like those around the country, are very much looking forward to this becoming the law of the land. I'm very much looking forward to seeing that occur. Honourable members will understand that through these measures we are taking real action to help with the housing crisis in Australia, and we will do more in the future. I rise to speak on the Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023. This bill was announced with much fanfare. I note that the Prime Minister was actually here in the chamber to talk to this bill, so it does signify the importance of this to the government. But this is the latest iteration of many policy announcements to address the housing crisis, both the availability of housing and the affordability of housing.  Unfortunately, it will be another lame duck scheme that will attract very little interest. Why do I say that? I'm not trying to be pessimistic; I'm just trying to be realistic. There are multiple shared-equity schemes already that the states run, quite appropriately, because under the Constitution the states have the head of powers and the responsibility for public housing and for housing regulation. New South Wales has 6,000 places on its scheme, with 30 per cent equity being offered for existing homes and 40 per cent for new homes. Victoria has a scheme as well, only it has 13,000 places. South Australia's HomeStart shared-equity scheme is smaller but it is out there. Western Australia has a shared ownership scheme via its home loan lender called Keystart, and Tasmania has the MyHome shared-equity scheme. What do they all have in common? They have in common very poor take-up by people who are meant to benefit from them, and the reason is people have done the sums. It's a bad deal, even with the initial concept of not having to pay interest on large amounts of capital. Who would feel comfortable with that? A family's home is their castle, but they wouldn't own it all! They're going to end up with as little as 60, 70 or 75 per cent equity, depending on what scheme and which state they're in. The deal is that you pay 100 per cent of the transaction cost, the stamp duty and all the legal fees, but the government owns a sizeable chunk of it. Under the rules of the scheme, you also only get your portion of the capital gain and the government gets proportionally more because they don't share any of the stamp duty or legals. And it traps buyers with an income ceiling to remain eligible. If they earn more than $90,000 per year as a single person, or $120,000 as a couple, for two years in a row, all of a sudden they get 'please explain' letters and have to pay back some of it. And if you really get a wage rise, or your business takes off and you're doing well, you might have to pay up in full. So a lot of people who thought they were going to be in a stable situation with a long time to pay off their equity, paying increments slowly, could be short-changed. It's also a bit of a worry because a lot of people are going into a scheme when they don't really have enough capital behind them. If you're paying your own insurance for your loan, which is another thing that's insisted upon, that could cost you up to $30,000 over the duration of the loan. For those of you don't understand it, a shared-equity scheme means that the government puts up some of the capital and has a covenant over a portion of your property. The reason that the states run it, as I mentioned, is because it's their constitutional duty to be involved in this. Community housing has become a bit of a hybrid situation, where philanthropic groups that build houses to rent have taken over from classic housing commission as the predominant community 'not owned but rented space'. We have existing large schemes to give that section of the building industry low-interest loans. This government is continuing that great initiative, the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, which offered billions of dollars and developed and delivered thousands of cheaper homes for rent. And once you're in the community housing space, Commonwealth Rent Assistance kicks in from the federal government. The other problem with this scheme is that it's not going to affect affordability favourably. In fact, it may increase the price of homes. As we know, there's a short supply issue, and this initiative is not addressing the shortage in supply. It will not curtail demand, it will probably increase demand—although the reluctance of buyers will limit that. As I mentioned, in our federal Constitution there is no mention of housing. That's why we also need to seek approval from the states for this system to go ahead. The state treasurers must be licking their lips and rubbing their hands together, thinking: 'Here we go! We can now cost shift some of our responsibilities over to the Commonwealth,' as they have done successfully in public education and public hospitals over the last 15 or 20 years. They used to be responsible and run it all, but now the Commonwealth is treasurer for many of the state responsibilities. That's a major problem for our Federation, because we have different responsibilities; we have welfare payments, the NDIS, Defence and all these other things, and the federal budget can't be expected to pay for six states and two territories as well. But, hey presto! Where we've ended up is that we're responsible for half of this. Having the federal government trying to fix housing shortages is a bit of a moot point. There were initiatives when former prime minister Morrison was the Treasurer and responsible for housing. He released some federal land in Sydney, Melbourne and, I think, Brisbane—I'd need to check the records. That is a great initiative because that's half the problem. The states need to release more land. Local councils need to rezone more land for housing. The federal government effect is accepted, and people take it, but it's not going to fix the fundamental problem, which is mainly in the domain of humble local councils and state governments. That's where I think we should be focusing to get these costs down. As I mentioned, in a country town, like the many I have, the rate-limiting step to getting housing developed is getting development applications approved by the council. It might take a year or more, let alone getting a construction certificate and getting new areas rezoned. It's laboriously slow. Builders in my region are tearing their hair out. There is money for affordable housing through community housing approvals, and there are private landowners that would develop that in a flash for those community and affordable housing providers, but, again—hey, presto!—it's not held up because of anything the federal government's doing or anything the state government's doing; it's the local council. That is what's really frustrating people around Australia. There is overregulation of simple development. Also, local councils are pretty much refusing to do any of the major headworks, even though they end up getting an income stream of rates for generations to follow. They put it all onto developers. Depending on which state you're in—in New South Wales, for instance—with a new area set aside for developing housing, often the land developer has to buy the same amount of land to offset clearing for housing, so poor land buyers or first homeowners are paying for two blocks of property; the one that's offset is a cost on their property. The developer has to do the NBN development and telecommunications in the block, obviously, but, if there is major sewerage work or new water supplies, councils are now adding those responsibilities—which are in the DNA of local government to do. We have all these other things barrelling down at the construction industry, such as same-job same-pay and closing-loopholes bills, which are going to put many self-employed, subcontracting tradesmen in the situation of being looped into being an employee, which they are not happy about. They certainly don't want to be paying $17,000 more for their next ute or their light commercial vehicles, which is coming barrelling out of this Labor government. The states and councils really need to get their act together. The other issue is that state governments and councils are allowing in our metropolitan areas this unstoppable urban sprawl, which is not good use of land. It's not good economics. I know a house-and-land package is everyone's dream but, with the costs and the lack of infrastructure, we really need to do more urban consolidation. We need to re-assess the heights of domestic buildings. There are plenty of cities the size of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane that have houses quite regularly three storeys high. You might have several families in them. The quarter-acre block is a gone thing unless you're really moving out into the regions. In the vein of consolidating valuable urban land, I suggest that the useless bits of land, maybe the size of these desks here in parliament, between each house to make them separated buildings, would be better used by making semi-detached buildings, taking that dead space between each house and putting it into footpaths or big urban squares over the whole development. Semidetached houses were a really effective use of land when they were built at the turn of the century. Many smart builders are looking at this, but we should be insisting on it. The other thing we can be doing is hiding in plain sight. Regional Australia is crying out for more people to come and grow the regions. You can have an affordable house-and-land package. We need companies that pay above award, with high costs to get good workers moving to regional Australia, but we need state and local governments to allow for more water storage, land rezoning and land release and also to make sure that there are things set aside for services when they develop these lands. Those are things like community shops, petrol stations and connections for bus routes or trains. One of the things that we were great at doing in the last two governments was getting up schemes like the First Home Super Saver Scheme, where you could put a maximum of $50,000 of your superannuation—not more than half your superannuation—into your first home deposit. There were 300,000 people on the first home loan insurance guarantee. Single mums, single parents and women who were going for their first home benefited from all those coalition policies. Some of them continue under a new name, with a bit more capital thrown in. But that's what we should be doing rather than this well-intentioned but half-baked and muddle-headed thinking about shared equity. The states have shown it doesn't work. We need to fix the fundamentals, increase the supply of housing, make it easier to develop at the state and local government levels and insist on this from states at the equivalent of COAG meetings. Then we will see better things happening in land and housing prices. The other thing is that we must stop this rampant, unchecked immigration that is not sustainable while we're in the middle of a housing crisis. We need to really shrink it to highly skilled workers and refugees and leave it at that. Before coming to this place, I had the pleasure of spending 10 years in local government. In that time, there wasn't a week that passed in which housing wasn't talked about or on the agenda. We talked about housing targets, the cost of housing, housing diversity, affordable housing, planning reform, renters' rights, strata reform, inclusionary zoning and voluntary planning agreements—it went on and on. I've been at the coalface of the policy response to housing for a long time. In that time I've learnt that, for elected officials to address this properly, we need every level of government in a bipartisan way singing from the same song sheet. We need no politics—just progress.  For decades, we've had politics on housing. It's been so, so long. Politics on housing have put us into the mess we're in today. In my time on council and as mayor, New South Wales was governed by a state Liberal government. Throughout that time they would say that affordable housing was a priority. But the thing is they'd never do anything about it. Upon becoming premier in June 2017, former premier Gladys Berejiklian declared that housing affordability was the biggest issue for her. Liberal planning minister after Liberal planning minister would say nice things about affordable housing and the need for more of it but then actively stop people or governments from trying to do something about it. They promised to reform the planning system and didn't. They rezoned urban activation precincts across Sydney and New South Wales, saying that affordable housing would be provided, and it wasn't. Then they actively opposed local government plans to force developers to build affordable housing. We see the same thing happening today here in this parliament. It's a different level of government, but it's the same old Liberals and the same old politics. The Liberals here on one hand are complaining about the housing crisis that they exacerbated, yet they are actively opposing policies to address it. They voted down the Housing Australia Future Fund. They criticised the Housing Accord. They criticised state Labor governments' attempts to address housing supply. They criticised our fee-free TAFE program, which is addressing huge shortages in construction workers. And then, probably worst of all—and we just heard it from the member who just spoke, the Member for Lyne—they backflipped their views on bringing in skilled workers to help address skill shortages and now instead choose to blame migrants for the housing crisis that they created. The housing crisis has been around for a long time. It didn't just happen because of last year's migration levels. It didn't happen when the Albanese government was elected. It has been around for a long time, and it exists because of decades of inaction by lazy politicians. It exists because the Liberal federal government didn't adequately funded housing supply. It exists because the last Liberal federal government didn't care about housing or work with the states to deliver it. It exists because Liberal state governments have blocked schemes to deliver more affordable housing. It exists because politicians keep on playing politics. The housing crisis existed before the last election, and Australians elected us to help address it. We were elected on the promise to deliver: Help to Buy, the Housing Australia Future Fund, investments in social and affordable housing. Since my election I have been inundated with calls and emails from constituents about the cost of rents, the lack of housing supply and the growing cost of housing. These are people who work hard, who contribute to our communities and who simply seek a place to call home. Whether it be young professionals striving to enter the property market, families yearning for a place to raise their kids or seniors seeking dignified retirement living, the lack of accessible and affordable housing options is a growing social crisis. It's a reality that cannot be ignored. It's a crisis that demands action. Yet whenever this majority Labor government, a government that was elected with a mandate to address the housing crisis, proposes a policy to address the housing crisis, we're met with bad-faith actors in this place who are more interested in playing politics with this crisis than delivering solutions for our country. I have outlined the Liberals' record on this. The Liberals now have a third coalition partner to play politics with. The Greens political party, here in this place, are working hand in glove with the Liberals and Nats to block, delay and vote down policies to address the housing crisis. They may say different things, but the results are identical. I say to the Greens and the Liberals: you can't say you want to help renters when you oppose policies to address housing supply. You can't say that you want more people to own a home when you block shared-equity schemes like this. This two-faced politics is a betrayal of the people who supported you, and it's putting politics ahead of progress. The Help to Buy scheme isn't just about bricks and mortar. It's about giving people hope and giving them an opportunity to own their own home. It's about helping renters who are unable to save a deposit. It's about getting someone into the property market for their first home. Just like the Liberals, the Greens also say they want housing action, yet their actions in this place say the absolute opposite. The Greens, alongside the Liberals, are blocking progress while claiming to champion the very causes they hinder, and they use strikingly similar measures to do it: they spread misinformation, they sow doubt and they politicise, which all result in less action to fix this crisis. Their claims that measures like Help to Buy will inflate housing prices are misleading. The reality is that these initiatives are tightly targeted—a bit too tight, if you ask me, but anyway—and have been endorsed by experts who say that impacts on pricing would be modest, if there would be impacts at all. Sound familiar? The Greens and the Liberals are peas in a pod. Just like the Liberals, the Greens have made quite the habit of using misinformation as a tool to sow confusion, obstruct progress and further their own politics. All that leads to is Australia's housing crisis becoming worse. In February 2024, the member for Griffith falsely stated that the Greens negotiated an additional $3 billion for public housing with the government, conveniently omitting that this allocation was not a result of negotiations. And just in this House moments ago, the leader of the Greens claimed that Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts only changed because of the Greens, when this decision was made squarely by the Labor cabinet and then by the Labor caucus. It's just the Greens taking credit for things. Just like the member for Dickson misrepresented the reality of the impact of vehicle emission standards, the member for Griffith misrepresented the reality of vacant properties from census data. No, Max, we don't really have a million vacant homes. Just like the Liberals, when they ignored departmental analysis and advice, the Greens fail to acknowledge the complexities surrounding unoccupied properties, ignoring research indicating various reasons for vacancy including holiday homes and temporary unavailability. The Greens, the Nationals and the Liberals will do anything in their power to stop this government from addressing the housing crisis, but we are determined to do something about it. It's why I was elected and it's why we're in government. Help to Buy will support the purchase of up to 10,000 properties per year over four years. Australians, including citizens in Bennelong, are fed up with politicians playing political games with essential policy that will help them. Whether it's the climate wars or the housing crisis, people don't want politicians to come in this place and use their time here to obstruct. They want this place to work constructively and in good faith to find solutions to their issues, and they're fed up with the Greens' and Liberals' selfish and shortsighted tactics. They are tired of their obstructionism, which only serves to exacerbate the housing crisis and leave countless families struggling to find a place to call home. I'm proud to be part of the only party in this place that is prepared to do something about housing and ensure that as many people as possible can achieve the great Australian dream of owning their own home. I'm proud to be part of a government that has already delivered the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, the $3 billion Social Housing Accelerator scheme and the most significant increase to the Commonwealth rental assistance in 30 years. At its core, Help to Buy is yet another policy designed to help with the housing crisis. It will help renters into home ownership, it will help renters who cannot save enough for a deposit by only requiring two per cent of the purchase price and it will help people who can't afford to pay off a big mortgage, because the government will provide an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent. This policy is here to help renters own their own homes, and yet the Greens and the Liberals want to oppose it. They want to oppose it because it's all politics for them. Despite their grandstanding, we're determined to get on with this job. I commend this bill to the House. I quite like the member for Bennelong. But I have to say that while I said I quite like the member for Bennelong I didn't say that I liked his contribution to this debate. I think he's rather living in hope. I might remind the member for Bennelong and some of those newer members in this House that, constitutionally, the responsibility for housing belongs to the state governments.  I'll give him a little bit of a life example of what has happened in Queensland. For the past 35 years, Queensland has been governed by a state Labor government. I remember in my early days in the banking industry, on a Thursday when people got paid their pensions or their Centrelink allowances they would come in and pay their social housing payments. You had two types of payments. The first type of payment was for people who were on a rent-to-buy scheme. We have seen over the years those people successfully own their own home, and great credit to them and the effort that they have taken. They've worked hard to get to a point where they own their own property. The other scheme was for those who were renting. The rent was limited to approximately 30 per cent of those people's incomes. I represent an area that the member for Bowman would well know because it includes places that are also in his electorate like Eagleby, Kingston, Woodridge and Capalaba. It even includes areas in and around Beenleigh and Browns Plains, which are in the Treasurer's electorate. Those areas were where the Queensland Housing Commission built numerous homes during the sixties and seventies for people to either go into on a rent-to-buy scheme or to rent. Can I say that until the last couple of years I'd seen very, very little done in the intervening 20 or 30 years by the Queensland Housing Commission to replace the stock that was bought or that people eventually owned—and credit to those people for their hard work and effort, as I said before. But the Queensland government under Labor leadership and the Queensland Housing Commission didn't see fit to reuse those funds to build new properties to replace the ones that came out of the system. We have seen an ongoing discussion over the last number of years about the quality of the remaining Queensland Housing Commission properties available for rent because the Queensland Housing Commission has failed miserably to upkeep those properties. The Prime Minister, in his contribution earlier, referenced housing commission towers in I believe Carlton, in Melbourne. They tell a similar story of woe—that the Victorian state government has failed to maintain those properties in a manner in which they are fit for people to live in. Now we have the situation where our state governments are turning around and saying, 'Oh well, it's not our problem.' They pass the buck to the federal government, and we finish up with schemes like this to try and solve a problem that is entirely of the making of the state governments because of their failure to continue to provide social and affordable housing since the mid-eighties. It's about time the state governments stepped up and took some responsibility for their failure in that space. In addition to their failure in that space, they have failed to ensure that our planning schemes have kept pace with the needs of a growing community, and they have failed to see that our infrastructure has failed to keep pace with the needs of our growing communities. As the member for Bowman would know and as the member for Capricornia, who is at the table, would know, we have a multitude of infrastructure problems right across south-east Central and North Queensland as our communities have grown and our population has grown. But the state governments have been asleep at the wheel. They seek to continually shift responsibility and an expectation to the federal government to solve the problems that they have failed to deal with that are actually their responsibility. So let's actually shoo home that responsibility to where it belongs. Now, that brings me to this bill. What can I say? Before I came in here tonight I checked with a builder of mine, and this program covers whether you buy an existing house or you want to buy a new house-and-land package. I mentioned some suburbs earlier—Woodridge, Kingston and Marsden in the Treasurer's electorate and Eagleby in my electorate. I was talking to a real estate agent out Marsden way the other day. A fairly run-down modest three-bedroom fibro house is $700,000 plus. I don't know what the price is in Capalaba or Alexandra Hills, Member for Bowman, but I suspect it's not that far away from that. In Eagleby, it's sort of $600,000 or thereabouts. I just had a look at Park Ridge. Park Ridge South is where the new development area is in my electorate. I was speaking to the builder, as I said earlier, and they said it's roughly $400,000 for a block of land. For a modest house that's 150 square metres, three bedrooms—nothing special—which is not generally a house that's built these days. Generally people want four bedrooms, a study and all the bells and whistles. At $3,000 per square metre to build a modest 150 square metre home with a nice but not over-the-top fit-out it is $450,000. If you add that to your $400,000 block of land, it's $850,000 plus stamp duty, legal fees and all those other things. I ask the question: even with a fund like this, how many of these people who are struggling to save for a deposit will be able to afford it? At $850,000 that's a deposit somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000 in round figures, looking at stamp duty of another $15,000 even with the concessions they get from the state government. So now you're at somewhere around $30,000 to $35,000 as a minimum requirement before anything else. As a number of other people have said, these programs at a state level remain unfulfilled. So why is the federal government stepping in to provide an additional program which already exists at a state level which the public doesn't take up? Why would you repeat a mistake that's already being made? Why would you repeat something that the homebuying public doesn't want? That just makes no sense to me whatsoever. I would far rather see state governments held to account to undertake their constitutional responsibility and for the federal government to introduce some KPIs and say to them: 'You go and build your social and affordable housing and then you send us the bill. We're not going to give you the money until such time as you actually build these houses.' I can tell you that, if you give the money to the state governments, you can't trust that they won't put it into consolidated revenue and it won't go somewhere else. We've seen plenty of that over the years. So hold the feet of the state governments to the fire and actually get them to do what they're supposed to do constitutionally. That would be a far better solution in my book. But we aren't seeing that. We're seeing a big song and dance about rolling out a new program that for all intents and purposes I don't think is going to achieve the outcomes that are being sought. If you look at $5.5 billion over 10,000 people, that's $550,000 per person. That's an expensive exercise, not that I think it's going to go that far or have that many people take it up. We do need to encourage people and give people the opportunity to own their own home or, if they're not in a situation to own their own home, have a secure roof over their head, paying a level of rent they can afford. Nobody in this House disagrees with that proposition—nobody. But I don't believe that this bill as it's currently constructed without the relevant KPIs to force the state governments to do their job of providing social and affordable housing will achieve the results we're seeking to achieve. I'm proud of the measures that we took when we were in government to try and encourage homeownership through providing grants and/or guarantees. Interestingly, the only thing that this government has so far successfully done in this space is continue those programs that were set up by the coalition government. This program was supposed to be up and running, I believe, a year or so ago. So I don't think the government are even really convinced that it can do the job that they have proposed that it can do. Mr Hill: It can't without legislation. Mr VAN MANEN: It's taken you two years to bring on the legislation, so that shows how committed you are to it. Once again, we see the government trying to solve a problem that the state schemes like this that already exist aren't solving because they are not being fulfilled. We need to continue working towards reducing those costs. Until we see some definite, concrete measures, that is not going to occur, and I'll continue to oppose this bill.","Help to Buy Bill 2023, Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(18:18):"

"0","0","0","1","1","0","426","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","In 2018 I made a speech in this place regarding the importance of the agriculture sector. It wasn't my first speech on the topic, but it was the first time I spoke about the great disparity of power between the farmers, growers and producers of products and the retailers who sell them. Here we are, six years later, having the same conversation. Of course, the reason why we're having this conversation is that nothing has changed, legislatively, in that time. We still have a duopoly in the food and retail sector. We have duopolies right across all sectors in Australia. With respect to supermarkets, we know that our farmers are the price takers and not the price makers. In my speech I implored members to read Supermarket Monsters, by Malcolm Knox. In the current market this book is even more important than way back in 2018. If you have not read it and you are listening to this speech somewhere in this place, I would say: find the book and read it. I think it's even available at the library.  Around my electorate I've spoken to many primary producers, and the story is always the same: they cannot continue to operate with the high input costs—energy, wages, transport—while receiving bargain basement gate prices. We are sleepwalking into a disaster. Mum-and-dad farmers are exiting the market, particularly in dairy. Mum-and-dad farmers will simply be lost for good. It's heartbreaking to hear comments from them, such as, 'I can't afford to deal with the duopoly and I can't afford not to either,' and, 'It now costs me more to produce than what I receive, but there's no pricepoint increase.' They are trapped. They have no bargaining power and, without it, no alternative. As I said, they're price takers, not makers. It's not just the primary producers that are affected by the duopolies. We all are. We're all paying dearly for it. The lack of competition in the retail sector removes the need for innovation, price competitiveness, service and every other aspect associated with true competition. Many of us are just delighted to actually find a checkout server, rather than having to do it ourselves—receiving no 'staff discount' for doing so. I welcome the government's direction to the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into the Australian supermarket sector, including the price practices of the supermarkets and the relationship between wholesale—including farmgate—and retail prices. However, I'm concerned: we went down this path before, in 2008, and nothing happened. In part nothing happened because the ACCC found that there was 'little evidence to substantiate allegations of buyer power being exercised in an anticompetitive and unconscionable manner'. But the report did go on to say: … however, there were some complaints of buyer power being exercised where the complainant appeared to be genuinely reluctant to provide information to the ACCC out of concern about retribution if details were provided to the ACCC and investigated. This is the crux of the problem. Suppliers are almost solely reliant on selling to one of the two retailers, and they're reluctant to question, challenge or criticise, for fear of retribution or having their line deleted from the shelves. I hope the current inquiry gives sufficient protection and peace of mind to primary producers. It's time that we joined other countries, like the United States, that have had antitrust laws for a long time. We need to introduce them here to protect consumers and businesses. Antitrust laws are not associated with communist countries, as some in this House have suggested. They are laws that regulate the conduct of business to promote competition and prevent unjustified monopolies and duopolies. The United States is the mecca of capitalism, but it manages improper business conduct through laws such as the Clayton and Sherman acts, which outlaw restraint of trade and attempted monopolisation. If the US can do it, we can do it too. For too long Australia has been the playground of monopolistic and duopolistic enterprises. This has stifled competition, harmed productivity, forced our primary producers to the edge of extinction and contributed to the worst cost-of-living crisis in living memory. Past actions have not worked. Repeating them is not going to work either. We therefore need to do something differently. We must consider antitrust laws and we must consider them now, because, if we want to still to be drinking milk that's made in Australia and eating food that's made in Australia, we have to do more to support our farmers, and this is the way to do it.","Grocery Prices","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(19:30):"

More than one million applications were left in that black hole of a department when the Liberals were booted from office. Before they all get hot and bothered and try another little scare campaign on migration, to be clear, a significant proportion of these were people who had already been in Australia for years, hanging around on bridging visas or waiting for their partner visa or another visa to come through to build their lives here. They included husbands, wives or children of Australians, here or stuck overseas, coming to live in the family home. There were hundreds of thousands of people hanging around waiting for months on visitor visas when those opposite left office. There were 300,000 people or more hanging around on bridging visas.  Why? Because the Liberals cut 1,000 staff from visa processing over their wasted decade of dysfunction and decay when they were in office. That's what the budget papers show: 1,000 staff. There were also deliberate policies of discrimination against people from some parts of the world, including partners and children. The number of conversations that those of us in multicultural electorates had to have during the time in government of those opposite! These included conversations with women who were turning 46 and losing their chance to ever have children in this life, because they'd maxed out from IVF. The previous government didn't care. People spent three or four years waiting for a partner visa—just inhuman. People missed funerals, weddings or other family events. Some missed the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones because the previous government cut 1,000 staff from visa processing. This is not an optional extra in a multicultural community. The member for Reid knows this well. We've spoken about it. This is an essential service. It is as essential as Centrelink or any other Commonwealth government service when you need to stay in touch with family, friends and loved ones or you're just an Australian who falls in love with someone from overseas. I want to now praise the Department of Home Affairs for the terrific work that they've done in clearing these backlogs. Who knew? The government's employed 500 to 600 new staff in visa processing, and guess what? They processed visas and cleared the backlog. Take partner visas. Between 1 July and 31 December last year, there were enormous improvements in partner visa processing: a 54 per cent increase in temporary partner visa finalisations compared to the equivalent period in 2022, and the biggest increase in at least 17 years in permanent partner visa finalisations—a 158 per cent increase compared to the equivalent period. These are people already in the country, so the opposition can't run a migration scare campaign. They're the husbands and wives of Australians and have been here for years, just waiting for the permanent visa to come through so they can get on with their lives with certainty. Additional resources have also been allocated to the complex onshore team, which is so important to my electorate, particularly the Afghan nationals. Since 1 July 2022, this dedicated team has reduced the oldest part of the caseload—that is, applications lodged before 2016. Imagine that. Seriously reflect on it, I say to those opposite—2016. We've reduced that by 89 per cent, from 3,280 down to 342 applications. So, when we came to government, there were 3,300 people who, under that mob, had been waiting for their partner visas since 2016—disgraceful. The TPV or SHEV holders have a pathway to permanency, and the vast majority of those have now been granted. Again, these are people who had been in the country for a decade or more—permanent temporary migrants, an underclass in Australian society who were excluded, were never able to see their families and were never able build a life here. It didn't just harm them; it did our country and our society no good to have this permanent shadow underclass. They've been fixed. The majority of them have been granted. We've made progress on the humanitarian program. For the first time since 2018-19, the humanitarian program was delivered in full. The government has increased the number of places—doing the right thing, given global demand. It's not easy, it costs money, it's not popular in every part of the country, but it's the right thing to do, particularly to bring to safety those people who risked their lives working for Defence and Foreign Affairs in Afghanistan. They risked their lives and their family and loved ones. I want to compliment the Department of Home Affairs on the progress that they've made and on the difference they're making to people's lives.","Migration","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(19:35):"

The lack of action from the Albanese Labor government when it comes to health across the nation is really concerning. There's so much smoke and mirrors by the Labor health minister on health care, it is absolutely extraordinary. I'll tell you a bit about it.  The public are being sold a positive story on health, but further inspection shows that there is so much lacking. To name a few concerns, there are concerns from Australians and stakeholders around bulk-billing and community pharmacies, and the rollout of the Medicare urgent care clinics and the kids Head to Health hubs. We have a government that has slashed Medicare-subsidised psychology sessions in half, and it continues to call for reviews, meaning change in the sector is just not happening at all. There are issues regarding the National Diabetes Services Scheme and access to pumps that deliver life-saving insulin. There is a shingles vaccine shortage, and we have low rates of COVID vaccine uptake in aged-care facilities. I have stakeholder after stakeholder saying that they can't even get in the door of the health minister to talk with him. These stakeholders include mental health organisations, medtech companies and medical researchers. Let's start with the Labor government's response to the report of the House's Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport inquiry into long COVID. As deputy chair of the committee and shadow assistant minister for mental health and suicide prevention, I am particularly dismayed by some of the government's comments in response to the report. The health committee, in recommendation 6 of the report, noted: Mental health support for those with long COVID must be provided in an affordable, timely and equitable manner, and regular review of mental health issues should be part of GP management noting that the extent of related mental health impacts is still unknown The government's response, and, more pointedly, the minister's response, stated: … a number of mental health supports are currently available to those impacted by COVID-19. These include Medicare-subsidised psychological services through the MBS Better Access Initiative … a range of online and digital supports … It is extraordinary that the government is recommending people access a program that they have cut in half. Thirteen months on from when the cuts came into effect—in January 2023—it is being reported that fewer people have been accessing psychology sessions, whilst mental ill health continues to rise in Australia. Let's not forget the broken commitment on Labor's Medicare urgent care clinics. We saw scores of clinics open late across the country. The government talk a big game now, talking up their Medicare urgent care clinics, but they opened late. And some of them, like in my electorate of Lindsay, only stay open until 8 pm, not the promised extended hours to help with emergency wait times. The quickness of the government's 60-day prescription policy will see impacts across the country, according to the Pharmacy Guild—quickness in completely blindsiding community pharmacists across the country. I've held a roundtable with pharmacists, ongoing in my community, who are bewildered by this decision. It means that pharmacies will be paid once for twice the amount of work, and we know that costs will increase and that those costs will be passed on to consumers. We have doctors across the country who are putting off giving seniors the shingles vaccine because there is a shortfall. We need a government that takes medical procurement seriously. We've heard from the Stoma Industry Association that another review is being conducted into the Stoma Appliance Scheme. I am informed by the association that there have been multiple reviews over the last two decades, and they weren't made public. I hope the next report by this government makes the findings public to assist. This is just one example of the litany of reviews and commitments with which this Labor government is dragging everything down the track. It is not only in this industry; it involves multiple sectors and review after review. The recent NDSS decision about constant glucose monitoring devices means less choice for people with type 1 diabetes. We need solutions and better medical technology across the board. I know my fellow health portfolio holders in the House agree with me on this. They are working really hard to hold the government to account. So we're calling on the government to step up in the health space, because right now the nation depends on it.","Health Care","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) ","(19:40):"

But, when you don't have good reception, it can have a profoundly frustrating impact on day-to-day life, and that's certainly been the case for people living in Five Dock and Canada Bay.  A local constituent got in contact with me to express his deep frustration with the poor mobile reception. He told me how it affected not just his daily life but his work too. He's a freelancer who often works from home. New clients couldn't contact him for potential work, and existing clients got frustrated that their calls weren't being answered. It was so frustrating that this person has considered leaving the area altogether to get better reception. Stories like these led me to run a community survey to find out just how widespread the problem was, and the response was huge. I was overwhelmed. I received almost 400 postal and online survey responses detailing the poor mobile coverage and how it impacted people. In answer to the question, 'How often do you experience mobile black spots?' one constituent said, 'Often, when I'm inside the house, the caller on the mobile cannot hear me clearly, so I need to go outside to continue the conversation or ask them to call me back on the landline.' Another said: 'It is hard to get signal at our home regularly. We recently had difficulties calling emergency services via triple zero.' Poor mobile coverage is having an impact on their quality of life, their businesses and their ability to work from home. That's why I have written to and met with the major telecommunication providers: Telstra, Optus and TPG. I've asked each provider to come up with a plan to improve mobile coverage for Five Dock and Canada Bay, and I will report back to the community about the next steps. Bad mobile reception isn't just an issue that is localised to Five Dock and Canada Bay; it's an issue in Wentworth Point too. These are suburbs in metropolitan Sydney, less than 20 kilometres from the CBD, with thousands and thousands of residents. We've managed to significantly improve the mobile coverage in Wentworth Point thanks to working with the telecommunication providers, and I want to do the same for Five Dock. But it points to a broader problem with mobile coverage, and that's the lack of planning. That's why I'm so grateful for the communications minister's efforts to bring in broader communications reforms through the telecommunications in new developments policy. The policy was updated and took effect on 17 February this year. It sets a clear path for how we're going to prevent these frustrating black spots from happening in the future. It's about ensuring that, as a community grows, everyone moving into new developments has access to modern telecommunications, including both mobile and broadband services. Just as you expect to have water and electricity when you move into a new area, developers will now have to view mobile connectivity with the same level of importance as these essential services. This will apply to new residential properties with more than 50 lots. Developers will be encouraged to engage with mobile network providers early in the process so new homes will be well built and well connected too. The principles that drive this key policy are to engage early, plan thoroughly and build not just for now but for the connectivity needed for tomorrow. We've seen how badly affected communities are when the planning is not done right and mobile coverage is not considered. So, while I'm determined to patch up the gaps in mobile coverage across my electorate, I'm very pleased that the Albanese Labor government is doing the hard policy work to ensure that this sort of remediation work doesn't need to happen as often in the future. If we plan it right at the very beginning, mobile coverage and internet broadband usage will be something that everyone in this country can take for granted.","Reid Electorate: Telecommunications","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SITOU (Reid) ","(19:45):"
"0","0","0","1","1","0","434","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","A couple of weeks ago, I spoke to a group of eager and very well-educated seniors at the Probus Club of Main Ridge in my beautiful electorate of Flinders. They had invited me to come along and speak about parenting in the age of social media, but our conversation quickly progressed to all things 'tech for good' and sometimes things 'tech for bad'. I was left with the now familiar feeling that we have not quite done enough to equip our seniors with the skills that they need not only for the digitised world into which they have been thrown so completely in a post-COVID life but especially in respect of the risk of online scamming.  Scamming is doing untold damage to many of the community based values that underpin what is so beautiful about living in Australia: our trusted institutions, our faith in other people, honesty, generosity, self-reliance and, above all else, self-confidence. Today scams impact everyone. No-one is spared. Not the tech savvy, the highly educated, the financially savvy or the circumspect are spared. Among my constituents who have fallen victim to scams are retired doctors, soldiers, accountants and small-business owners. The scammers are very sophisticated. They can teach a 90-year-old normally stumped by myGov or iview to download remote-access technology in minutes, laying bare their financial tools and passwords to the scammers' manipulation. From the data, we know that the elderly are at much greater risk of being scammed. Those over 75 are 50 per cent more likely to be scammed than those just 10 years younger. No-one should feel ashamed falling into the trap. Indeed last night, I listened to a podcast by Ryan Pullen, director of cybersecurity at the SANS Institute. You would think at least he would be safe from scamming. But, in his TED Talk that was released overnight, he describes how a few weeks ago he received a phone call at around 8 pm. The person on the other end knew his name, his address and his mother's maiden name. The number he was called from was the fraud number for his own bank, and, when he googled the names of his interlocutors, he found them on LinkedIn as employees of his bank. He had the good sense though, while on hold, to simultaneously call the bank's fraud line from another phone and ask them to add a special note to his account. When he asked the fraudulent interlocutor what that note said, he sensed a moment of hesitation and a slight flummox and he ended the call, blocked all his accounts and changed all his bank cards. This man's professional life is cybersecurity, yet he went down the rabbit hole for an hour and a half until he managed to make two simultaneous calls and set a trap for the fraudster. This was only facilitated because his actual bank picked up the phone and he reached an actual human in real time at nine o'clock at night. When you ring a fraud line at nine o'clock at night in Australia, you don't always get a human and certainly not in real time. More often, it's a digitised interface giving little if any reassurance to the caller that the remedial steps that they seek have actually been put in place. This is made infinitely worse by the ongoing closure of bank branches across regional areas and even so-called metropolitan areas like mine, which denies concerned customers the option of turning up and shutting down their bank accounts or at least seeking advice face to face. Billions of dollars are lost to scammers every year. In 2022, Australians lost a combined $3.1 billion to scams, an increase of an enormous 80 per cent from 2021. If home burglaries went up by 80 per cent in one year, we would have a significant increase in on-ground police forces, community awareness campaigns and measures to make people feel safe. But, at the moment, Australia is lacking the tools to stop scams happening. In the words of one of the big four banks that I met with recently on this topic, Australia is an easy target. Last week, I met with the Australian Banking Association, who told me about the scam safe accord they have developed with their member banks and implemented last November. While I truly thank them for their efforts and note recent moves by the government to address this scam scourge more comprehensively, there is so much more we can do immediately to help people, particularly the elderly, in a proactive, supportive, customer service oriented way. Banks could inform elderly customers, for example, of the risks they face, not just by advertising online or putting it on social media but by writing to their homes and suggesting they install appropriate security measures. They can even recommend the original two-factor authentication, requiring for all significant transactions the authority of the elderly customer and a trusted family member. Our response is too slow, too complex and not customer focused enough to make our citizens feel safe. We have much more to do.","Cybercrime","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms McKENZIE (Flinders) ","(19:50):"
"0","0","0","1","1","0","436","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I rise to address this House on a matter of paramount importance: the wellbeing of working Australians. As the federal member for Holt, I'm aware of the challenges families face in Melbourne's outer south-east and across the nation. The escalating cost-of-living crisis, compounded by exploitative employment practices, poses a significant threat to the livelihoods of working Australians. In response to these challenges, the Labor Party has developed a comprehensive plan to deliver meaningful support to working families. Our approach includes both immediate relief measures and structural reforms aimed at addressing the root causes of the cost-of-living crisis. At the heart of our strategy lies our commitment to creating jobs and getting wages moving again, which is the foundation of substantial economic growth. Over 650,000 new jobs have been created since Labor came into government, and, through our workplace reforms, we've delivered the highest annual wage growth since 2009. This is not just about numbers; it's about empowering individuals and families with opportunities for advancement and economic security.  But we know that job creation alone is not enough. We also need to ensure that workers are treated fairly and have access to secure employment. That's why the closing loopholes legislation, championed by the Albanese Labor government, represents a landmark achievement. We have closed loopholes that enabled the undercutting of wages through dodgy labour hire practices to ensure the same pay for the same job. We have criminalised wage theft to ensure that a bad employer can never steal from the wages of their employees. We have strengthened protections for casual and gig economy workers to ensure that all workers are treated fairly and have access to secure employment. But our commitment to supporting working Australians goes even further. Our plan to support workers addresses a range of issues, recognising the varied nature of the challenges facing Australian families. We understand that addressing the cost-of-living crisis requires multiple approaches. Our cost-of-living tax cuts are a vital component of our plan. These tax cuts ensure that every single Australian worker receives a fair share of relief, with particular attention to those on lower incomes. In Holt, families are set to benefit significantly, with the average tax cut amounting to $1,321—substantial support for households grappling with the rising living expenses. Whether you're in Clyde, Cranbourne, Hampton Park, Narre Warren South or Tooradin, with Labor's plan, all taxpayers will now get a tax cut. Under Labor's plan, 90 per cent of taxpayers in my electorate of Holt will get a bigger tax cut. Beyond tax relief, our 10-point plan includes electricity bill relief, cheaper child care, expanded Medicare bulk-billing, cheaper medicines, increased income support payments, free TAFE, more affordable homes and expanded paid parental leave. These measures are designed to provide support where it's needed the most, ensuring that working Australians have the resources they need to thrive. Moreover, we are investing in essential services like health care and education, which are vital for the wellbeing of communities in growing areas like my electorate of Holt. From building more affordable housing to expanding paid parental leave, our plan is focused on improving the lives of working families. The Labor Party's commitment to working Australians is unwavering. We understand the challenges facing families in Holt and beyond, and we are dedicated to delivering meaningful support to improve their lives. From tax relief to job creation, and from wage growth to worker protection, our vision for a fairer and more prosperous Australia is clear. Together, we can build a future where every Australian has the opportunity to thrive and to achieve their aspiration so no-one in this country is left behind.","Albanese Government","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms FERNANDO (Holt) ","(19:55):"
"0","0","0","1","1","0","438","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The Help to Buy Bill 2023 is a really important reform for Australians seeking to buy their first home. We know that there's no more important human right than providing a house and a roof over people's heads—a place for someone to call home, to raise a family and to feel comfort and security—yet too many Australians are being priced out of the housing market in every state and territory across the country. You now see this despair in younger generations of Australians, who have the view that they will never ever be able to afford to get into the housing market. Ten years of neglect from the previous government and the failed ability to come up with a comprehensive housing plan across several states have seen supply dwindle and prices skyrocket. It's left many Australians in despair.  The government is aiming to arrest that decline, to reverse that despair and to provide young Australians, in particular, with hope that they can once again afford to live and to buy a home in the suburbs that they call home. This Help to Buy program is not the sole element but an element of the government's program and policies to make housing more affordable for more Australians and to increase housing supply. This significantly reduces mortgage crisis for eligible low- and middle-income earners by offering savings of up to 40 per cent on purchasing a home. It's designed to address entry-level market challenges by helping to empower Australians to achieve homeownership without inflating prices, and that's the key. There have been several schemes from Liberal governments—at both the state and territory level—that provide a cash payment to first home buyers, and several studies have demonstrated that the effect of those cash payments is just to pour fuel on the fire. You actually increase demand, and real estate agents and vendors price in on the support that's been given by government. It's made prices worse, and it's made the problem worse. But this plan should ensure that prices aren't artificially increased by unnecessary government support. This is one element of Labor's comprehensive housing plan that creates a vision to create a more diverse and affordable housing solution for Australians. It's part of our goal, with the state and territories in partnership, to build 1.2 million new homes, demonstrating our commitment to expanding homeownership opportunities. We're prioritising helping more Australians achieve that dream, which should be achievable, of owning their own home. We recognise the ongoing challenges in the housing sector. Since coming to office, we've supported tens of thousands of Australians to secure safe and secure housing. In 2024, we remain committed to delivering more—more support for home buyers, renters and Australians needing secure accommodation. While recognising the critical situation facing renters, the Help to Buy scheme assists low- and middle-income earners to purchase their first home. To ensure accessibility, income eligibility and property price purchase caps will be implemented, varying by state and region. These caps are designed to support Australians in accessing moderately priced homes aligning with the program's core objective. Australia's housing challenges are complex, and our government is committed to addressing them comprehensively. So how does the Help to Buy scheme work? It acts as a shared-equity program, providing an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes. Participants can enter the market with a minimum deposit of just two per cent. The program will run for four years, offering 10,000 places annually. It's a co-investment scheme, where the government co-invests with the budding home purchaser to ensure that the price for purchase is affordable. It will empower Housing Australia to establish these shared-equity arrangements as quickly as possible. This is modelled off a scheme which works in Western Australia called Opening Doors. It's been in place since 2011. It's delivered by their Department of Communities, and it's making homeownership more accessible for low- to middle-income Australians in that state. It's helped tens of thousands of Western Australians own their first home. It's been very successful. It's proven that it works, and this is the scheme that the Albanese government is modelling our scheme on. Since taking office, we've already supported the construction of 4,937 new homes through Housing Australia. Applications are open for the first round of the Housing Australia Future Fund and the National Housing Accord, and over the next decade we've committed $25 billion in new housing investments. Whilst the states hold primary responsibility for housing policy, the Commonwealth seeks a specific referral power to strengthen the program's administration. It's important to note that the housing experts advise against short-term measures like rent caps and rent freezes, which can have unintended consequences. We remain committed to ongoing collaboration with all levels of government to achieve better housing outcomes for all Australians. The National Cabinet has committed to a better deal for renters, aiming to harmonise and strengthen renters' rights across Australia. This includes requiring reasonable grounds for eviction, limiting annual rent increases and phasing in minimal rental standards. Additionally, the government delivered the largest increase to Commonwealth rent assistance in over 30 years to support low-income renters. The National Cabinet has also agreed to an ambitious target of building 1.2 million new well-located homes over five years, commencing from 1 July this year. The Commonwealth is providing $3 billion for a new homes bonus, incentivising the states and territories to undertake necessary reforms to achieve this goal. We have an ambitious agenda to help Australians either get into housing or be able to purchase their own home. This bill is part of a suite of policies that include constructing more affordable housing, constructing more social housing, building a Housing Australia Future Fund, ensuring better rights for renters, partnering with the states to build more homes and having a program such as this that assists Australians to realise that Australian dream of buying their own home—a place that they can call home with security and comfort for their families. Having listened to a lot of people speak on this, it's unfortunate that the approach of those opposite in relation to this bill is simply that housing is an issue for the states, and this is nothing that the Commonwealth government should be involved in. Housing should be left to the states—it's their issue. Well, that approach over the last decade from the previous coalition government has left us in the mess that we're in at the moment. It's meant that the Commonwealth has been uninterested in ensuring that housing supply kept pace with demand. The states, having failed to meet those demands within their individual jurisdictions, have ensured that demand has increased but supply hasn't, so we've had a housing shortage and a massive increase in prices, to the point where mortgage repayments for the average Australian have now increased by multiples of their annual incomes since the former coalition government came to office. It's no stretch to say that the former coalition government failed Australians when it came to adequately supporting their housing needs. The Albanese government intends to fix that. We are not going to stand by and say, 'This is an issue for the states.' We are going to get in and get our hands dirty and work to ensure that we build the houses that Australians need—1.2 million of them over the course of the next five years—to ensure that we boost housing supply to ensure that housing is affordable and that Australians can realise the dream of owning their own home. That's exactly what this bill does.

"0","0","0","1","1","0","441","Buchholz, Scott MP ","230531","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Thank you, Deputy Speaker, and may I commend you on the outstanding contribution you are making to this House in that role. Australia is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis. Everyone in this House knows it. Every day we hear stories in our electorates of young people and young families being locked out of the residential property market. The pain is very real and governments must respond.  In weighing up whether to support this bill we first have to consider the potential benefits. It's a shared-equity scheme. The government says that the scheme will assist Australians to overcome the hurdle of both saving for a deposit and servicing a mortgage. Participants will only require a minimum two per cent deposit and will benefit from lower ongoing mortgage repayments via smaller home loans. It's said that the scheme could reduce the cost of buying a home by up to 40 per cent. Against this, concerns with the scheme include that the scheme does not address the current lack of housing supply and that the scheme could contribute to an increase in demand and, therefore, an increase in housing prices. Further, the scheme is capital intensive and ties up capital and is difficult to scale up if successful or, in fact, to be scaled back. There are concerns that the scheme could divert resources from supporting those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. It's also said that the scheme might encourage some participants to take unnecessary risks that they otherwise would not have taken. The scheme will apparently create places for 10,000 eligible purchasers every year. How many will be in the Calare electorate? It's difficult to say, but some possibly will be. It's because of this potential benefit to first homebuyers in the Calare electorate and other country communities that I have decided to support this bill. Helping 10,000 eligible purchasers per year is clearly not a silver bullet for the housing affordability crisis, but it will at least help those lucky enough to get a start in the scheme. Another piece of legislation that can make a positive contribution to easing the housing affordability crisis is the Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Foreign Entities Bill 2024. It's a private member's bill that I introduced to the parliament during the last sitting period. I introduced this bill because many years ago every single Australian could expect that at some point in their lives they would have the opportunity to own a home or unit and live the great Australian dream, but that dream is slipping away before our very eyes. My bill would ban foreign property spectators from buying homes and units in Australia for two years. Many countries have already introduced such laws, including Canada, New Zealand and Singapore. In Australia, it seems strange that we haven't already done this. In 2021-22, during COVID, foreign buyers snapped up 4,228 Australian homes and units. Most of these purchases were in the under $1 million price bracket. Since those figures were published, the activities of foreign property speculators have been ramping up big time. The National Australia Bank's recent Residential property survey found that the market share of foreign buyers in new Australian housing markets in October to December 2023 grew for the fifth straight quarter to a 6½-year high of 11 per cent. In New South Wales, foreign buyers had a 15 per cent market share. This points to a near five-fold increase in market share from a low during the COVID pandemic in mid-2021. The NAB survey also found that international agents are reporting an increase in inquiries of over 400 per cent. We could make thousands of new homes and units available to Australians immediately, without having to take years to build them, by putting a pause on foreign property speculators and giving more Australians their shot at the great Australian dream of home ownership. This is not about turning our backs on the world, but it is about putting the interests of Australians struggling to get into the housing market ahead of the interests of cashed-up foreign property speculators. I would urge all members of this House to support my bill. It now needs to be passed into law.  Deputy Speaker, I concur—you are doing a wonderful job. I rise to make a very short contribution on the Help to Buy Bill 2023 as someone who had the benefit of a help-to-buy scheme. My parents were part of the baby boom generation many years ago and, without the government's choices when they decided to buy their house, were probably unlikely to have been ever able to own a home. That made a considerable difference to my family, to my sister and me. It meant I received an education and I am able to stand here as the member for Werriwa. My sister is a doctor. She is an associate professor and has worked in universities for a very long time. I won't share with the House how long because I didn't get her permission to do so! But we ended up with a very stable life, and that is what the Albanese government intends to do with these bills: make sure that people get the opportunity to be able to live the life that they want to live.  It is very important that you have an address. For many jobs, your address means whether or not you get an interview. It means whether or not you might actually be considered for that job long-term. Is it close to transport? Is it where people who actually want to work live? Being able to choose a house and being able to live in those houses is really important. I'm sure many people in this House, and not just on this side of the aisle, had their lives changed because governments made decisions to help to make sure that people got what they deserved and what they were part of. That's what these bills do. I commend these bills to the House. I think we all should consider just what the Australian people deserve and what our government should be providing for them. I spend a lot of time visiting schools in Goldstein and what the schoolkids say to me often sticks in my mind and occasionally disturbs me. At one school visit, for example, one of the children, a year 5 student, approached me to ask about inflation and when I thought it would stop rising. 'My mum and dad are really worried about interest rates, and I'm worried that we might lose our house,' she said.  I was barely out of my teens during the slide into the recession we had to have in the early 1990s, with interest rates at 18 per cent. Times were very tough for my dad as a single parent, who in the end sold the house. Yet in the early 1990s it took the average Australian about seven years to save up for a 20 per cent deposit for a typical dwelling. Now it's almost doubled, to 12 years and rising. Now we have a housing crisis. This is not because of ultra-high interest rates, although the recent increases from the emergency levels of the pandemic are another factor in the stress that many Australians are suffering; this housing crisis has been a long time coming. Simply put, we've not been building enough dwellings to meet demand, and we don't have the skilled workforce or materials to rapidly ramp up supply. It's broadly acknowledged by eminent economists that first home owner schemes, which have been extended over the years, may be beneficial for the buyers who are fortunate enough to access them but are largely counterproductive in addressing the broader problems of affordability and supply. The evidence is that because they do not address supply and effectively increase demand they act to increase house prices and therefore reduce affordability. The basic facts are well known but warrant repeating. Help To Buy is the latest instalment in this government's efforts to address the housing crisis. I will support the legislation despite the reservations I have about the bill, just as I supported the Housing Australia Future Fund despite my concerns about its governance provisions and the adequacy of its capital base. It's a decision made on balance—more good than not so good. But what worries me about this legislation is the almost complete absence of specificity. Who will it help? Who'll be prioritised if it's oversubscribed? How will those decisions be made? Will younger people struggling to raise a full deposit be given priority, or will it, for example, be given to older women who are confronting a retirement of poverty because the banks regard it as being too late in their lives for them to qualify for a mortgage? While Help To Buy might do a little to ease the housing crisis for a relatively small number of people, let's be straightforward: it won't fix the problem, which has been a long time coming and which will take short-, medium- and long-term initiatives to fix. As the Grattan Institute noted in 2022, when Labor unveiled its proposal, while important, shared equity is also no panacea to Australia's broader housing affordability crisis. Nonetheless Grattan, which proposed a similar scheme itself, says that shared equity could help many older Australians into home ownership at a time when home ownership rates are declining, especially for this cohort and the poorer among them. According to ABS data, just 55 per cent of the poorest 45- to 54-year-olds own their own homes today, down from 71 per cent four decades ago. The problem is particularly acute for women—and not just older women, although they are most likely to find themselves most challenged in keeping a roof over their heads. A report last year from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute details the extent to which women face discrimination and disadvantage in the housing market, specifically that women are less likely to be able to save for a deposit on a home and that those who do manage it take longer to save for a deposit than their male peers. Women are therefore less likely to own a home to support them in retirement. Older women, paying off a mortgage, experience higher levels of stress than their male peers, which affects their health and wellbeing and places further demands on our health systems. Most severely, as housing becomes less affordable, homelessness rates are rising. Older women and women fleeing violence are more vulnerable to homelessness, meaning younger women are overrepresented in homelessness numbers, and older women are the fastest growing group of homeless. With that in mind, and considering my concerns about the absence of priorities nominated in the legislation for recipients of the benefits of the program, I will be proposing an amendment to the bill that would add a specific reference to women in the object of the legislation. It would also provide a prod to Housing Australia and those in the states and territories responsible for administering the program that they should be cognisant of particular historically disadvantaged cohorts among the low-income individuals that the legislation is designed to assist. I understand that the minister will be reluctant to agree to the amendment, in large measure because of the complexity of negotiating agreements with eight state and territory governments to get this program off the ground. That said, I would ask, then, that reporting on the program is sufficiently comprehensive and detailed to enable us to know for sure and in a timely way that it's assisting the cohorts it aims to help, especially women. I add here that I know my colleague, the member for Wentworth, will be moving an amendment flagging concern around the lack of a disallowable instrument under this legislation, and that I will also support that amendment. Grattan applauds the proposal as a positive step forward, particularly in its potential benefits for some older Australians—disproportionately women, who have increasingly been excluded from the housing market. In the 1980s, fully 71 per cent of the poorest 40 per cent of 45 to 54-year-olds were able to own their own home. Now it's down to just 55 per cent, according to the ABS, in part because, as I said earlier, it now takes much longer to put together a deposit. The Melbourne Institute's HILDA survey found that just 34 per cent of women who separate from their partner and lose the house managed to purchase another home within five years, and only 44 per cent do so within 10 years. For men, the comparable figures are 42 per cent within five years and 55 per cent within 10 years. That's still not great, but better than the predicament confronting their female equivalents. There are other unintended consequences even for those women who retain the family home as part of a separation settlement. I know of women in the Goldstein community who now find themselves struggling to pay the rates, pay for repairs or pay for heating and cooking. In part, the reason for their predicament is down to just two words: stamp duty. I went to the last election campaigning for an independent, well-funded and adequately resourced review of the tax system, including property taxes. The impact of stamp duty amid what was then an emerging housing crisis was one of the reasons, and, if we're to address the central problems of housing affordability, the issue of stamp duty cannot be avoided. In my state of Victoria, homeowners and would-be home owners are burdened with the biggest stamp duty take in the country. Analysis by the Melbourne Age shows that the Victorian government raised fully 27 per cent of total state taxes from stamp duty last financial year, compared with a mere 11 per cent in the nineties, and rising above 20 per cent in the early 2000s as property prices took off. According to real estate data analysists PropTrack, the reason is simple: bracket creep. The proportion of Melbourne homebuyers paying the top rate of stamp duty has increased from six per cent in 2008 to 33 per cent today. Homebuyers in Melbourne now need the equivalent of six months of average full-time, post-tax income, or $42½ thousand to cover stamp duty on a median priced home—a sixfold increase since the mid-1980s. In my electorate of Goldstein, where a median priced home now sells for $2.2 million, stamp duty totals $123,000. No wonder people won't move, even if their kids have left home, they've got bedrooms gathering dust, the house is bigger than they need and they struggle to pay the rates and maintain the property. As eminent economist Chris Richardson puts it: 'Stamp duty is a big red stop sign in front of people where they want to be.' Not only is stamp duty an increasing in barrier to entry for first homebuyers, it is also highly inefficient as well as inequitable, reducing economic activity in Victoria by 55c for every dollar raised—$4.8 billion lost last financial year. More than a decade ago the review headed by Ken Henry recommended a shift from stamp duty to a broad based annual land tax. A report commissioned by the former New South Wales government made a similar recommendation in 2021, pointing out that, with stamp duty, those who buy and sell property more often pay more tax compared to those who transact less frequently. Its effect is to shift the cost of infrastructure and essential services, like schools, hospitals and roads that everyone benefits from, onto a narrow section of the population, who carry the burden simply because they decide to move house or sell a business more often. The Henry and New South Wales reports and their recommendations were underpinned by safeguards designed to ensure that homebuyers and homeowners not be penalised in the transition. The New South Wales report recommended offering homebuyers a choice: stick with stamp duty or opt for land tax. There would be transitional costs, and that is where the Commonwealth should come in. As with competition policy in the 1990s and early 2000s, designed to boost productivity—now second only to the cost-of-living crisis as our biggest economic problem—the Commonwealth should reward states that are prepared to make the change with financial assistance to ease the burden on state budgets during the transition. While previous election commitments, and a degree of PTSD, would deter this government from action on other areas of tax reform—negative gearing and the capital gains tax discounts, for example—the stamp duty/land tax swap is another matter for due consideration in the tax review that we have to have. An opt-in system would make this more politically palatable. Meanwhile, Help to Buy will make some difference at the margins and a relatively small number of deserving individuals will benefit. But we shouldn't kid ourselves that it will make a substantial dent in the housing crisis. That's why I've been urging the government to show a bit of bravery in addressing reform, and beginning a conversation with the state on property taxes would be a good start. Both the coalition and the Greens want to obstruct the Help to Buy Bill 2023, not because it is bad legislation but because it is in their political interest to do so. They both want to ensure that the housing crisis continues right through to the next election and then make it a campaign issue at that time. They are putting politics before people and self-interest before public good.  Housing ownership rates in this country have been falling for decades. In fact, in 2006 homeownership was at around 70 per cent. In 2021 it was down to 67 per cent. Outright ownership—that is, mortgage-free ownership—in 2001 was 38.2 per cent and in 2020 it was 29.5 per cent. The cost of housing today is somewhere between eight and 10 times average household incomes. Housing has never been more out of reach for working Australians. Homelessness has never been worse and public housing waiting times have never been longer. That's why the Albanese Labor government has made housing a priority policy, with significant funding allocations and a range of policy initiatives that acknowledge that the causes of the housing crisis are many and varied. There is no silver bullet for fixing the housing needs, because there is no single overriding cause. Material shortages, skilled trade shortages, state and local government fees and taxes, interest rate rises, foreign investors, taxation policy and immigration have all, from time to time, been singled out as the cause of today's Australian housing woes. Each of those issues has been identified as a contributing factor, and each of those issues perhaps does play a role within the responses that are required. However, I want to add to those issues two other matters—firstly, the decline in state government provided public housing. In my own state of South Australia, four decades ago, with a population of around 1.3 million, there were over 60,000 public houses. Today, with a population of 1.8 million, or an increase of 40 per cent over the 1.3 million, there are only 30,000 public homes. If we had maintained the 1980s trend, we should have somewhere around 85,000 public houses, but that is not the case. I suspect that the same figures would apply right across the board to other states. My second observation is that over recent decades there has been a slide in the number of residents per household, necessitating an increasing number of homes. I note that the member for Goldstein talked about separated families. Family separations are dividing families, duplicating the number of homes required and therefore driving up home prices and housing rents. This legislation is part of a suite of measures that the Albanese Labor government is backing to make housing available to more people. It will support up to 40,000 households to purchase a home of their own over the next four years under a government backed shared-equity scheme. The government will provide up to 30 per cent of the funding required for existing homes or up to 40 per cent for new homes. Shared equity is good policy. It gives new homeowners a foot in the door. It gives them an asset, including capital growth, at a price that they can afford with ongoing affordable repayments. When I was Mayor of Salisbury, some two and half decades ago, we initiated a very similar scheme, where the council's contribution to the shared equity was the land itself. From memory, the funding was provided by HomeStart Finance to eligible lower-income applicants. The rest of the scheme was almost identical to what has been proposed here tonight, and I have to say that there was nothing wrong with that scheme whatsoever. Homeownership is good for families and good for society. It's good for families because it provides security and stability. Unlike for renters, the weekly payments go towards securing an asset, which inevitably appreciates in value. Stability and security are what build communities. I note that those opposite have raised a number of objections to this legislation and asked a number of questions. What happens if the homeowner defaults on their payments? What happens if there are home improvements made—who gets the benefit of that? If the homeowners want to sell, who will be eligible for the funding that has been made available by the federal government? Who sets the price caps? What happens if someone passes away? What are the income limits that will shut people out of the scheme? The questions go on. All of those matters can be addressed; they are not insurmountable. While some members might say, 'I don't see the clear answers in the legislation,' the reality is that what this legislation does is set up a framework. All of the other incidental matters, in one way or another, can be resolved and will be resolved. I'm sure that the minister has already addressed those other issues as part of the package of legislation. To try and use what I call excuses as to why this legislation might not work is, to me, simply proof of the fact that coalition members and the Greens don't want to support it. Again, that's not because it's not good legislation but because they want to keep this issue alive right through to the next election, when they can campaign on it. The truth of the matter is that this legislation ultimately helps to provide additional housing. The solution to lower house prices and lower rents is, indeed, to increase supply. I think other speakers have made that point time and time again. This legislation increases supply, and the fact is that every other measure that the government has introduced will increase supply. That is exactly what the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund does. It's what the $3 billion Social Housing Accelerator payment does, it's what the Home Guarantee Scheme does and it's what this legislation will do—increase supply. When you increase supply, rents will start to come down and the price of housing will start to come down. When that happens, both renting and homeownership become more affordable to people that want to get into the housing market. We on this side of the House acknowledge that homeownership is important to Australian families. We acknowledge that it is becoming increasingly difficult. We acknowledge that there is no single solution to all the problems, and that's why we have introduced a suite of measures. This is but one of them. I note the comments made by the Leader of the Greens, who spent his whole 15 minutes talking about negative gearing. Not once did he talk about this legislation. Not once did he articulate what is specifically wrong with this legislation, but simply spoke about negative gearing. The debate about negative gearing has been part of the housing conversation in this country for nearly 100 years. In fact, negative gearing was brought in in the 1930s in order to address the shortage of housing at the time. And it's been part and parcel of the Australian psyche and the Australian system ever since. Yes, it was dropped for a couple of years under the Hawke government, but it has been part of the Australian taxation system for nearly 100 years. The problem with the shortage of housing didn't just arise yesterday; it's been in the making over the last two or three decades. It's time that governments finally addressed it. The Albanese government is doing that by the suite of measures that I referred to. This legislation is part of those measures, which will make a difference. I'll make this last point, because it was a point that was raised by one of the coalition members in their contribution, that there is no take-up in the state schemes. I think they were referring to the New South Wales scheme, where there's a very low take-up. If there's no take-up, then what's your problem with the scheme anyway? The fact that nobody takes it up doesn't make it a bad scheme. In other words, there is no cost to anybody if there's no take-up. So if that's the reason for opposing it, it simply doesn't make sense. The reality is, I believe, that there will be take-up if you make it fair and equitable, and that's exactly what this legislation does. I rise to speak on the Help to Buy Bill 2023. We have a housing crisis in this country. Every day that this crisis persists, people's ability to choose the life that they want to live is eroded. It's an unacceptable situation. We all know that there are few things as important as having a place to live—a place to be safe and secure and healthy, and a place to raise, protect and nurture your family. We also know that when a person does not have adequate housing, many aspects of life are that much harder. Being able to secure and maintain a job is very difficult. Enrolling and sending children to school is a challenge. Just being able to adequately prepare food for your family becomes a struggle. Things which many of us take for granted every day are incredibly difficult for those people who do not have secure housing. Housing is a human right, not a privilege.  Homeownership is increasingly out of the reach of younger and less wealthy Australians. More young Australians are continuing to rent well into their 30s and into their 40s. Nearly a quarter of couples who started their family more than five years ago are still renting. Single mothers are now more likely to be in a private rental than not, which is a big change from 20 years ago. People with a disability also face increasing challenges in finding and securing a home. Older women are one of the fastest-growing cohorts now facing homelessness. The Grattan Institute recently predicted that the share of over-65s who own their home will fall from 76 per cent today to 57 per cent by 2056. Today's older renters risk joining tomorrow's renting retirees, nearly half of whom live in poverty. Their numbers will only grow in the future as fewer retirees own their homes. Older Australians who don't own their home when they retire are often doubly punished because they are affected by the aged pension asset test, which ignores housing equity but does capture other savings. Rent assistance paid to pensioners who rent remains woefully inadequate, even after the recent 15 per cent increase. The frustrating truth is that solutions are available when we have political will to do so. We can see the answer to that when we look at how we were immediately and effectively able to house the homeless during the COVID pandemic, only to turn them back onto the streets once the worst, acute phase of that pandemic passed. There can be no pretence that there are immediate solutions for supplying housing at scale. This is a wicked problem which has had decades to develop. But we do need to attack this problem as a matter of urgency on as many fronts as possible. This Help to Buy program will help house more than 40,000 people. It will fund 10,000 a year for four years. The Help to Buy Bill 2023 establishes a shared-equity program, addressing the fact that many people looking to buy a home cannot save enough money for their deposit. The program will enable certain low- to middle-income earners to purchase new or existing homes by obtaining an equity contribution from the federal government. That is, the purchaser and the government will effectively be co-owners of the property. A prospective purchaser will need a deposit of at least two per cent of the purchase price. Eligibility for the program is limited to individuals with an individual income of less than $90,000 or to couples with a joint income of less than $120,000. The federal government will provide 40 per cent of the property's purchase price for a new-build home and up to 30 per cent of the purchase price for an existing home. The purchaser will pay the stamp duty and will arrange the mortgage for the remainder of the purchase price, but they will not require lenders mortgage insurance. While purchasers remain in the Help to Buy scheme, they should have lower repayments. The government won't charge rent, and the purchaser will not have to pay any interest to the government for its equity contribution. But the government will take a second mortgage over the property as security over its equity contribution. We know that there's considerable disparity between housing prices in different parts of the country. So property price caps for the scheme will differentiate between states and territories and between urban and regional areas and the rest of the state or territory. For example, the price cap in urban Victoria is $850,000 and for the rest of the state it is $750,000. The purchaser will need to live in the home and not rent it out or use it as an investment property. They can't already own other land or property either in Australia or elsewhere, but they do not need to be a first home buyer. This is important because it means that people who have co-owned properties but then sold them—for example, as part of a divorce settlement, and we know that people who are divorced in middle to late life often struggle to buy property subsequent to that—will be able to access the program. When a participant sells the property, they will need to repay the government, subject to some provisions around improvements which I'll refer to shortly. If a person sells their dwelling for $1 million and the government has a 30 per cent equity stake, they will need to repay the government $300,000 upon settlement, even if the initial stake was less than that. This is unless the person has already bought some of the equity back from the government prior to the final sale of the property. There are stipulations in the legislation regarding compulsory buyback of the government's share if a participant's pay increases above the borrowing threshold. There has been some debate as to whether or not this program will push up house prices. Many say that 40,000 homes is not nearly enough and, sadly, that is true. Most agree though that, given the relatively small number of homes in the program, it is unlikely that it will have any significant inflationary effect on house prices, although it's important to note that a substantially expanded scheme, should one be launched by the government, would materially boost demand for housing and therefore also boost house prices and, hence, could prove both inflationary and counterproductive. It is my view that there is much to be done and that this program is, sadly, only a very small part of a very large puzzle of housing. But it is one that will have a significant impact on the lives of the more than 40,000 people who might otherwise have little to no chance of purchasing a home. I hear from those people in my electorate office every week. I talk to them on the streets of my electorate. I understand that Australians—most of us—share the great Australian dream of home ownership. That is something which has, for many, many people, including my constituents, become just a dream in recent years. That's not to say that this program could not be better. The income thresholds of the scheme are probably too high. About 70 per cent of working singles earn less than $90,000 a year. That's a very significant proportion of the population. And 39 per cent of couples earn less than $120,000. This scheme shouldn't be available to people who are on above average incomes—people who have a good chance of purchasing a home anyway. It should be reserved for those people who have very little chance of doing so without assistance. Also the entry requirement of a two per cent deposit, rather than the five per cent suggested by experts like the Grattan Institute during the development of this policy, increases the risk of borrowers falling into negative equity should house prices fail. I've spoken before in this place about the critical need to maintain faith in our democratic institutions and the important role, the vital role, that parliamentary oversight plays in maintaining transparency. It's disappointing that yet again with this legislation we hear that most of its detail will be buried in the delegated regulations—in this case, the so-called program directions. Much of the program's detail remains unclear. For example, what happens if the value of the home declines? Granted that's unlikely in the current environment, but who will bear the cost should that happen? What about the cost of improvements to the home which increase its value? I'm informed that the program directions will contain a carve-out for renovations, such that the government's equity interest will not share in those benefits, but aren't these the kinds of complicated details we should see in the primary legislation? Wouldn't it be useful to have those program directions now with the main part of the legislation as we vote on the bill? The speaker before me, the member for Makin, said that we can leave it to the government, that we can trust the government. But we're here for a reason, and that is to provide oversight over important allocations. This is a $25 billion scheme. We deserve to know the details of it and to have a chance to examine those details at the appropriate time, which is now. Moreover, yet again, we see that the program directions contained in the regulations are not disallowable. We can't dispute them, and they are not subject to sunsetting provisions. My crossbench colleague the member for Wentworth will propose that this be amended, and I will support her amendment. We need to enhance oversight, not diminish it, and in doing so, we need to avoid the cynical political manipulation that can occur or can be perceived to occur when important decisions are made behind closed doors. Transparency matters and, with an expensive, important scheme like this, the parliament and the people deserve transparency and clarity regarding process and policy. This is a big step towards helping some Australians who are struggling. It remains to be seen if the shared-equity model adopted in this bill will be further developed or will remain limited to its current form, but what is certain is that it is past time that this government took substantial long-term action to fix a housing crisis which has been decades in the making. Politics shouldn't be about the next election. It should be about the next generation. For too long, Australian governments have thought more about their own future and less about the future of the country when it comes to housing. I'm glad we're taking action on this. It has to change. I commend this bill to the House. I'm incredibly pleased to rise in support of the Help to Buy Bill 2023, as I know what a difference a scheme like this can make for those wanting their own home. In my home state of Western Australia, Keystart, a shared-equity program, commenced in 1989 as an initiative of the WA state government. Keystart is a private organisation with one shareholder, the housing authority, and it continues today, having received the support of successive state governments. Keystart has helped more than 85,000 Western Australians become homeowners. It is designed to assist low- to moderate-income earners purchase a share in a home with the WA department of housing co-owning the property, with an up to 40 per cent share, depending on the buyer's income and household size. Later, when the buyer can afford to, they have the opportunity to purchase all of the department of housing share in the property so they own it outright. From my experience, the success of Keystart has had a lot to do with the fact that the buyer has some skin in the game and their ownership gives them a sense of pride and purpose. They know they won't get another chance, so their resilience and determination are reflected in the lower-than-average rates of arrears experienced by Keystart.  The door to homeownership should be open to my constituents in the Pearce electorate. I want them to be able to fulfil their dreams of owning their own home, which is exactly what the Help to Buy scheme will deliver. The Help to Buy shared-equity scheme is simply the government sharing the cost of the home. The government is not a co-owner. If you take part, it's yours, and, thanks to Labor, you achieve it with a low deposit and lower ongoing repayments. Let me point out again to the members opposite that help to buy shared equity is simply the government sharing the cost of the home. The government is not a co-owner. If you take part, this is your home, and, thanks to Labor, you will achieve this with a lower deposit and lower ongoing repayments. I am aware of the importance placed on homeownership by local residents, especially by those approaching their retirement and likely to be relying on the pension for income in their later years. For some, owning their own home can be the difference between having a meal on the table or, indeed, a roof over their head. Financial wellbeing is essential for all of us, and many relate that to ensuring they have a home to live in. The 2021 census painted a rather disturbing picture in the Pearce electorate, given that 400 people identified themselves as homeless, with a hundred of those people being school-age children. Women aged 50-plus have, disturbingly, also found themselves among the homeless, despite still having earning capacity. It is important that they also have a pathway to owning their own home. It is imperative that we improve financial literacy and wellbeing in our communities. Becoming a homeowner means you need to understand what it means to have a mortgage and understand personal debt limits and savings programs. Talking to young people, I understand that the biggest barrier to homeownership is saving for a deposit for a house on a low or medium income. Sadly, for many the reality of homeownership appears to be nothing more than a pipedream, and this needs to change. We acknowledge that it will take more than one measure to bring homeownership back into reach for many people, so we are committed to the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee, which has already helped more than 13,000 people across Australia achieve homeownership. We also need more homes on the market, which is why we made the $3 billion New Homes Bonus available to the states to help them build more. Help to Buy will assist Australians both to overcome the hurdle of saving for a deposit and to service a mortgage. Through Help to Buy, the Commonwealth will cut the cost of buying a home by up to 40 per cent. Participants will only require a minimum two per cent deposit and will benefit from lower ongoing mortgage repayments through a smaller home loan. The Help to Buy scheme is an important part of our government's housing reform agenda. The Albanese Labor government is also working with all states and territories to deliver a better deal for renters. This will include developing a nationally consistent policy to implement a requirement for genuine reasonable grounds for eviction; moving towards limiting rental increases to once a year; ensuring victims of domestic and family violence have the support they need to secure a safe and affordable home; considering options for better regulation of short-stay residential accommodation; and phasing in minimal rental standards. This is welcome news for the estimated 271,800 plus renters in WA. The maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance was increased by 15 per cent, the biggest increase in 30 years. This will help over 107,000 households in WA. Our government is offering new incentives to boost the supply of rental housing in WA by changing arrangements for investments in build-to-rent accommodation. The Albanese Labor government has delivered $10 billion for the Housing Australia Future Fund, an investment to support social and affordable housing. In WA this includes 4,000 homes for women and children impacted by family and domestic violence or older women at risk of homelessness. The fund will help address acute housing needs within the first five years. There will be $200 million for repairs, maintenance and improvements to housing in remote Indigenous communities, $100 million for crisis and transitional housing options for women and children impacted by family and domestic violence and older women at risk of homelessness, and $30 million to build housing for veterans who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. Since the 2022 federal election we have held more than a hundred thousand people into homeownership through the Home Guarantee Scheme. The Albanese Labor government has been working carefully on the design of the Help to Buy scheme with states, territories and lenders. Members opposite need to know that this is unlike the HomeBuilder scheme, which negatively impacted the housing market and was criticised by the states and territories. States will need to pass legislation for the Help to Buy scheme to operate in their jurisdiction, and the Western Australian government has agreed at National Cabinet to progress legislation so that the Help to Buy scheme can run in WA. Help to Buy will support up to 40,000 low- and middle-income families across the country to purchase a home of their own. Housing Australia will deliver Help to Buy, and this scheme will help my residents in Pearce overcome the hurdle of both saving for their deposit and servicing their mortgage. This will be the first national shared-equity scheme of its kind. Through Help to Buy, the Commonwealth will cut the cost of buying a home by up to 40 per cent for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes. How disappointing it is that the Liberals are now delaying this scheme, hooking up with the Greens to string this along and continue to lock low- and middle-income earners out of their own home. Those opposite need to stop standing in the way of vital new assistance to help renters into secure homeownership. Owning your own home is something we all aspire to. I don't think you forget the day the build is finished or the sold sign goes up and you're handed the keys for the very first time. There is something special about knowing it is yours, that you can't be evicted by a landlord and that, if there are any changes you wish to make, you can make your own decisions freely without reference to another for approval. You can make the home your own and take pride in it. Ownership brings about a sense of security and belonging, embedding you in the community that you have joined. For older Australians, that security becomes very real when they're retired and are likely to be living on the age pension. I have spoken to many retired residents in Pearce who own their own homes and who have indicated the importance and positive impact that this has had on their financial and overall wellbeing. We want every Australian to have the security of having a roof over their head and a dignified retirement. For residents still striving to gain homeownership, the new Help to Buy scheme is designed to make that goal easier to obtain. Importantly, Help to Buy will be open to assist residents who have owned homes before and those who haven't. Whether you be a single person, a couple, someone close to retirement or someone just starting out, Help to Buy can assist you. By providing equity contributions to eligible participants, the scheme will reduce the deposit required and lower their ongoing mortgage repayments, thus enabling low- to middle-income earners who enter the program to access housing. By improving access to homeownership and safe shelter, this bill provides the conditions for people to live a healthy life through alleviating the physical and mental stress associated with housing and rental affordability. In an electorate like Pearce, which continues to grow—it's one of the largest and fastest growing in Australia—it is clear to see by the number of land developments underway that the goal of homeownership is still something we all aspire to, although it has been out of reach for some in our community. We have listened to the community, and we have acted. The Albanese Labor government's housing reform agenda will assist more homebuyers and renters. We want more Australians to have the door to homeownership opened to them. By delivering Help to Buy, along with our housing reform agenda, we will help more Australians achieve a safe place that they can call their home—their very own home. I commend this bill to the House. It's five past nine at night, and Labor promised we wouldn't sit late in a new family-friendly parliament, but what's truth to Labor? It's lie after lie. Here we are, and I'm rising to speak on the Help to Buy Bill 2023 and its consequential provisions bill. The bills before the House aim to assist the very long-shot build of 1.2 million additional homes over the next five years. Good luck to the Albanese government on that target! To be frank, I don't see how this can even eventuate when the Labor government in my home state of New South Wales has conceded they can't reach the 75,000 new-build target each year over the next five years. I don't know how one government in one Labor state can say that they can't reach the target and the federal government can say, 'We're going to build 1.2 million additional homes.'  From the outset, I will note the opposition's disapproval of the bill before the House. It is a tick-and-flick bill so the housing minister can say she's achieved an election commitment by putting this legislation through the parliament but the states and territories still need to get on board. We need to support first home buyers with assistance, but a shared-equity scheme where the government owns part of your home is not the way to get housing supply moving back to where it needs to be. We have states that are lagging behind on housing targets due to aspects of red tape and never-ending changes to strategic initiatives. Of course we want our cities to have more housing and different housing stock that suits the lives of all residents but we need to get on with building homes and stop continuously talking about review after review. Housing pressures are taking an immense toll in my community of Lindsay, which includes Emu Heights, Colyton, Londonderry near the Hawkesbury, and the new Western Sydney international airport at Luddenham. We are the heart of Western Sydney. We bridge the north and the south. Western Sydney is facing the brunt of the housing crisis. We're at the coalface of constant new developments popping up throughout our region without the additional infrastructure to support new residents in our community. We could have had that infrastructure, but $5 billion has been ripped away by this government. Glenvale Park, in my electorate of Lindsay—older parts of the suburb were built 20 years ago. Now developers are building other parts and sections. We have had the Mulgoa Road ripped away as part of the $5 billion. It's extraordinary. This is a road that would have unlocked additional lanes to support traffic flow at three intersections along the corridor. Just getting off the M4 coming home from Penrith should take only minutes to get to Glenmore Park, Regentville, Jamisontown and South Penrith. Instead, the constant logjams of cars, buses and trucks create ongoing traffic issues. How can the Albanese Labor government be taken seriously when they want 1.2 million more homes but will not assist in providing the much-needed infrastructure to go alongside the increase in population? We see this time and time again. Coalition governments build things. Labor gets re-elected, floats some big ideas and cuts what communities need most: infrastructure. We see this at the Commonwealth level, where Western Sydney, as I said, has had that $5 billion ripped away by Minister Catherine King. How can Western Sydney keep up with another housing boom when the feds won't come to the table on infrastructure and transport funding? They have cut St Marys and Kingswood commuter car park upgrades. People in my community need this. I wonder whether mums and dads who need to get straight into the car at night to take their kids to sport or pick them up after school are going to park when the neighbourhood is pumped with more development. The T1 heavy rail line is already well over capacity going from the Blue Mountains through Western Sydney and into the CBD. Will the Albanese Labor government assist in upscaling capacity of the rail network to support housing growth? We already know the state Labor Minns government has cut metro line extensions from the new airport to other parts of Western Sydney. Housing in south-western Sydney will go ahead as the aerotropolis kicks off, but yet again—typical Labor—they're cutting transport infrastructure in communities with growing housing needs. Labor comes in here want to talk a big game on cars and driving down emissions, but they won't assist in fixing existing public transport infrastructure to take cars off roads in corridors were more housing is taking place. Where are the federal government's plans to further support the new airport and its advanced manufacturing, research, higher education and health precinct with more funding into the Metros? That's right: it just doesn't exist, but they're happy to keep ticking a box on housing targets without thinking about the future of our communities and what they will need to flourish. Let's take a step back and remember what the Labor Party's commitment was on housing at the last election. They said they would get legislation through parliament to have Help to Buy up and running by 1 January 2023. However, we have the Help to Buy Bill before the House right now, and it's actually February 2024. I noted in my contribution to a housing motion moved by the member for Hughes yesterday that it looks likely to be an election year. It is quite possible, with the Albanese Labor government limping to the finish line. In their list of achievements, they want to sell to the Australian people that they have tried with housing by bringing Help to Buy before the parliament. Just trying is okay! But we know that if the bills pass this House and the Senate the scheme won't come online until the next financial year. If the bill passes, the housing minister will say on the hustings that they passed the bill and went ahead with the legislation. 'We're doing great!' But the minister will then pull the 'sorry, we ran out of time' card if there's insufficient data to demonstrate any positive benefit to any Australians, and particularly to young people trying to get ahead. What the Labor Party forgot to mention at the 2022 election was that all states and territories need to legislate the scheme as well. I doubt this will happen in time to create the change the government wants to sell at the next election. The Labor Party went to the last election with this scheme in mind, despite most states already having a shared-equity scheme for potential homeowners to partake in. Victoria has the Homebuyer Fund, South Australia has the Home Start shared-equity option—they've all got extraordinary names—and Tasmania has the My Home shared-equity program. Where I represent, in New South Wales, there's the Shared Equity Home Buyer Helper scheme. The shadow housing minister has noted that in New South Wales, an extraordinary 94 per cent of places for the scheme have not been taken up. Maybe that's because Australians don't want the government owning part of their family home. What I do know is that Aussies want a government that has the courage to put in place policies that will give first home buyers a real go at attaining the Australian dream—they want that dream for themselves, not to share it with the government—and to provide housing for those most in need. The previous coalition government did this work, and it was ably led by the honourable member for Deakin. He continues as our shadow housing minister because he has put in the hard yards, he understands the sector and he is passionate about Australians taking the first step to secure their family home. The National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, which the coalition established, provided $2.9 billion-plus in low-cost loans that helped to support over 15,000 social and affordable dwellings across the country. I previously worked in the community housing sector, and I know that policies such as this really help providers to build homes for those in our community who just need that hand up. I'm informed that we're seeing one in three first home buyers being supported by the coalition's Home Guarantee Scheme. This scheme helps Australians with deposits as low as two per cent to get assistance to enter the home they need. Saving for a deposit is getting harder and harder for young people, but the coalition's First Home Super Saver Scheme helps tens of thousands of Aussie families accelerate their deposit. Former prime minister Morrison noted the previous government's economic support during COVID in his valedictory speech today. The then government assisted the housing and construction sector during this time, with funds to allow 137,000 home builder applications. This generated $120 billion of economic activity and helped the sector survive the aftermath of multiple lockdowns across Australia. It's a pity that under this Labor government we see the lowest levels of dwelling construction in over a decade. The forecast for national new home builds and renovation activity is slowing as well. And they want us to think that everything is going great! With a housing minister missing in action and the government's key piece of housing policy being introduced in the last part of this parliamentary term, no wonder we're seeing record high numbers of liquidations in the building and construction sectors. Compounding this is a shortage of available construction materials and their increased cost. And we have a Treasurer who has tried to take credit for the success of the coalition's schemes and reforms, which is just absolutely ludicrous. The bills before us outline a niche scheme to help just 10,000 households each year. We need to boost aspiration in our country: providing families with an option from the government to own up to 40 per cent of their homes is not aspiration. We need an economy that ensures people can get on the property ladder without government overreach. The Labor government's proposal would see 10,000 households get access to Help to Buy each financial year and cost the Commonwealth $5.5 billion. I know where that $5 billion would have been better spent; it would have been better spent on the infrastructure in Western Sydney that has been ripped away. Shared-equity schemes across the nation have massive numbers of places remaining. This means that shared-equity schemes are currently not what Australians want to help them get the home they need for their family. The Albanese Labor government should go back to the drawing board and work out a serious plan to assist those who want to own their own home. 'The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress as well for his defence against injury and violence.' These words were penned back in 1604 by Sir Edward Coke. In the years that have since passed, these famous words have been repurposed many a time. They have perhaps diverged from their original intended meaning, but I would argue that contemporary adaptations have assisted their longevity, simplifying them to: 'A man's home is his castle.' It even became the premise behind the movie The Castle, a true Aussie classic, one ahead of its time.  Today it has become impossible for many Australians to understand what it is like to own a home. There is no aspirational class—it's a prize that has become unattainable by any realistic or objective standard. This is a problem that warrants a solution brokered between governments of all levels. According to the Grattan Institute, between 1981 and 2016 homeownership rates among the 25- to 34-year-old demographic fell from more than 60 per cent to just 45 per cent. However, this problem compounds further for the poorest 40 per cent of that cohort, with homeownership rates decimated during that time, falling from 57 per cent all the way down to 28 per cent—it has more than halved. This further highlights that this policy failure didn't occur merely today or yesterday; it has been baking into our economy for many years now. It is a problem requiring solutions across federal, state and territory governments. As such, it has festered within our economy and our society, with no one solution being a silver bullet. By a concerted effort across government, coordinated through the federal government, we can aspire to mitigate and reduce the prevalence of the problem and, on some accounts, minimise its impact too. This is what Labor aspired to do by bringing policies on housing reform to the Australian people at the last election, policies with depth and complexity. We had aspirations for the parliament to provide support for this and many more reforms we have sought to legislate for. We should be standing up for the aspiration of those with more modest ambitions. Those who aspire to have long-term stable housing and a roof over their heads without periods of periodic impermanence are an aspirational class as well, and there are many out there in the community that fit that bill. That's why the Albanese Labor government has been taking a holistic approach to addressing housing policy on a number of fronts since taking office. Help to Buy is just one of those approaches. and it is one that I am proud to be speaking in favour of here today. Help to Buy is a testament to the Albanese Labor government's commitment to addressing the challenges faced by so many Australians who are trying to carve out a slice of the Australian dream, Australians who are sick and tired of needing to justify to a bank how their rent payments provide proof of their ability to service mortgage repayments of a lesser amount. At its most basic and fundamental level, Help to Buy is a shared-equity scheme with 10,000 places per year to enable eligible applicants to purchase their first time. Through the scheme, the government will provide support by way of an equity contribution of 40 per cent for new builds and 30 per cent for the purchase of an existing home, all of this with a minimum deposit outlay of just two per cent. The scheme allows Housing Australia to enter into shared-equity arrangements with eligible homebuyers, effectively reducing the upfront deposit hurdle and ongoing mortgage repayments. This initiative is a response to the escalating challenge many Australians face in saving sufficient funds for a deposit, exacerbated by rising housing costs and the increasing burden of mortgage repayments. The primary aspect of this legislation is its funding mechanism: the Commonwealth has mandated to provide Housing Australia with the necessary appropriations to make equity contributions on behalf of the government. The devil in the detail underpinning this legislation is one that is intrinsically designed to align with the Commonwealth's constitutional powers, leveraging the referral of powers from states under section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution. This collaborative federal approach enables the scheme's nationwide application, accommodating the diverse housing markets and economic conditions across Australia's states and territories. Under this scheme, Housing Australia plays a central role, authorised to formulate, execute and monitor compliance with shared-equity arrangements. This encompasses the capability to terminate arrangements and manage noncompliance, ensuring the scheme's integrity and effectiveness. The legislation also carefully considers the potential financial implications for the Commonwealth and aims to mitigate risks through strategic management and operational guidelines. The return on the Commonwealth's equity contributions is intricately linked to the property's value, ensuring that the government's investment is protected while supporting Australians' homeownership aspirations. The Albanese Labor government's approach with the Help to Buy scheme is innovative yet pragmatic, designed to assist low- and middle-income earners in securing a stake in their own homes. It reflects a deep understanding of the barriers faced by prospective homeowners, including the significant hurdle of saving for a down payment amidst other cost-of-living pressures competing with this pursuit. The scheme represents the partnership between the government and the people. By providing an equity contribution, we aim to reduce the initial financial burden on individuals and families, making the goal of homeownership attainable for those who have been systematically disadvantaged by the current market conditions and are likely to have the disadvantage further ingrained as time moves forward. This initiative is born out of a comprehensive dialogue with communities, financial experts and housing advocates. It is a response to the clear message from the Australian public that the status quo is untenable and a bold new direction is required. Help to Buy is a testament to what we can achieve when we come together with a common purpose, guided by principles of fairness, equity and responsibility. It's a reflection of our belief in the power of government to make a positive, tangible difference in the lives of those we serve. If that sounds somewhat vague and anyone needs a reminder of who that is, well, it's the Australian people. This bill also represents a significant step towards rectifying the imbalances in our housing market, offering a practical, targeted solution that will open doors for many Australians. It is a carefully considered response to the complex issue of housing affordability, designed to complement existing measures and support a sustainable future for our housing market. By providing a pathway to homeownership for low- to middle-income earners, we are not just investing in property; we are investing in the dreams and aspirations of Australians, in the fabric of our communities and in the economic viability of our nation. Help to Buy embodies a vision of an Australia where every citizen has the opportunity to own a piece of this beautiful country, an Australia where the basic dignity of having a place to call home is accessible, not just for a privileged few with the means to accumulate multiple runs on that particular board. The Help to Buy Bill 2023 is our commitment to that vision. It is a step towards rectifying the imbalance in our housing market and towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society. It is an investment in the future of Australian families, in the stability of our communities and in the strength of our economy. The foundation stone upon which Help to Buy is built is that of an unwavering belief in the dignity of homeownership and stable living arrangements, and the significance of those things in the lives and dreams of most Australians. This bill is not merely about the bricks and mortar that form the walls of a house; it's about creating homes, fostering communities and building a future where every Australian has a stake in our society. The challenges we face in housing affordability are not unique to our time, yet they demand innovative solutions that reflect Australia's economic and social realities. The gap between income growth and housing prices has widened to a chasm, leaving many Australians without a clear path to homeownership. It is here in this gap that the Help to Buy scheme seeks to make its mark by offering a practical, targeted solution that acknowledges the diversity of needs among aspiring homeowners. The Albanese Labor government may have gotten wages moving in the right direction again, but Help to Buy, complemented by a number of other housing reforms—not just by this government but by state and territory governments as well—created cooperatively alongside a federal framework, is needed to unstack the deck, something that many have consigned to the too-hard basket for far too long. Cooperative federalism isn't a mere buzzword, although, through both its literal and plain meaning, it is a necessary component to making homeownership a reality for those who may have considered the Australian dream closer to a nightmare many moons ago. Moreover, the Help to Buy scheme is designed with a flexibility to adapt to the varying needs of Australians across this country. Whether it's for a young family looking to plant roots in a community, a single professional seeking stability and investment or older Australians downsizing into more manageable living spaces, this bill offers a pathway to homeownership that respects the individual circumstances of each buyer. In crafting this legislation, we have drawn upon a wealth of evidence and international examples that demonstrate the efficacy of shared-equity homes in improving housing affordability and have even incorporated lessons much closer to home, with similar schemes operated by the states. Other shared-equity schemes across Australia aren't competing with one another. They complement each other and expand the ability to access such a scheme to even more Australians, and this can only be a good thing. This is, of course, unless you're a member of the Liberal-National-Greens alliance that we have seen at many junctures of this 47th Parliament thus far. Many a time this strange marriage of convenience formed to then block the government, particularly in the other place, to make housing more accessible, more plentiful and more affordable for Australians. It is somewhat worth trying to ascertain the animus from both parties that caused these supposed political opposites to attract to one another. We all know that, by way of the member for Griffith's article in the Jacobin that was tabled in this place quite helpfully by the Prime Minister last year, the Greens don't want Australians to have the chance to have a stable roof over their heads through our housing policies because they are afraid that doing so 'would demobilise the growing section of civil society that is justifiably angry about the degree of poverty and financial stress that exists in such a wealthy country'. For those opposite, I suppose their reason for keeping people from affordable housing through Help to Buy or the Housing Australia Future Fund is less about politics and more for the sake of sport, perhaps. One would be led to believe that those opposite would see shelter listed upon the base of Maslow's hierarchy of needs only to disavow it due to it also including self-actualisation—a foreign trait for many and a trait that many appear incapable of attaining or exhibiting in healthy quantities. That rule of thumb was not followed when an ABC journalist asked one of them to vividly recount any events from their years in government. I note the member for Sturt commented only yesterday about the HAFF legislation, lamenting the Greens' eventual role in it passing to form part of the Albanese Labor government's housing reform agenda. To the member for Sturt and his side of the chamber, I would recommend that they provide their support to Help to Buy. You have the power to divorce from this marriage of your own making. If it were one of yours that you were proud of, why would you hide it from your friends? The Help to Buy Bill 2023 represents a significant legislative effort to address Australia's housing affordability crisis through shared equity. It's technical and operational nuances are carefully crafted to ensure that the scheme is sustainable, effective and capable of making a meaningful impact on Australians' ability to achieve homeownership. By leveraging Commonwealth and state collaboration, backed by a solid legislative and financial framework, the bill sets the stage for a transformative approach to housing policy in Australia. The Help to Buy Bill 2023 is a positive step towards realising the Albanese Labor government's vision for Australia, a vision where our housing market more strongly resembles a traditional Australian dream and less like the Australian nightmare and a vision where thousands of Australians will now have a chance of homeownership, where they would otherwise have a chance charitably described as negligible at best. Help to Buy is a step forward in the right direction towards realising the Albanese Labor government's vision by legislating further mechanisms where homeownership becomes possible to those considered long lost in the battle to get a foot in the door to an ever-tightening property market. We as a government are pushing the dial back towards where it should be, one that makes someone's first home an attainable and affordable reality, a reality where homeownership becomes accessible to those previously sidelined for the first time in several years. It is my hope that, through this debate, we can have 40,000 Australians with solid roofs over their heads because of us coming together to support this bill. I commend this bill to the House. For so many Australians, buying your first home is one of life's big moments. I'll never forget my first home—the thrill of being able to paint the walls apricot pink and the idea of putting up Laura Ashley floral wallpaper. I even had a crack at tiling the bathroom, and I quickly realised that I should stick to my day job. It was the 1980s. Owning a home is part of our national story. It gives us a sense of place and a sense of security.  Unfortunately, though, homeownership is increasingly out of reach for so many Australian families. A decade of rampant price rises, declining availability and soaring interest rates has made it harder than ever for Australians, especially young people, to break into the housing market. Today, it costs eight times the average annual income to buy a home in Australia. That compares to only a generation earlier, when buying a house would cost, on average, about 3½ times the household income. Today, unless you have the support of the bank of mum and dad, lower-income earners feel they're destined for a lifetime of renting. We hear a lot about how unaffordable houses are in Melbourne and Sydney, but regional and rural towns are seen as the alternative places where you can afford to buy a home, especially if you have a family. But, quite frankly, this just isn't the case anymore. There are three flawed assumptions about buying a house in regional Australia: it's cheap, there's plenty of it, and everyone wants the same thing. Firstly, it's not cheap to buy a house in regional Australia anymore. The median value of houses has increased by almost 55 per cent since 2020. This is almost double the value increase in capital cities. And let's not forget that the median income of regional and rural Australians is lower than the median income of metropolitan Australians. The second myth is that there are plenty of homes to buy. I'll talk about housing supply later, but right now let me say we do not have enough homes to buy or to rent. The final myth of housing in regional Australia is the assumption that, if you can afford to buy one of these plentiful homes, you want the quarter-acre block with a four-bedroom house. Again, this is no longer true. A Regional Australia Institute survey found that, in regional Queensland, half of all respondents wanted a semidetached townhouse, unit or apartment. Often, young professionals, essential workers or older downsizers actually want a two-bedroom place, but these are rarely available in the regions. Solving these challenges to ensure more Australians can access affordable and suitable housing requires many solutions, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The Help to Buy Bill 2023 is one part of the puzzle of fixing this crisis, which is why I will support the bill, although I do so knowing it has its limitations. This bill sets up a shared-equity scheme to help low-income individuals and families get a foot into the housing market. Via Housing Australia, the Commonwealth will contribute to the purchase costs of a home—up to 30 per cent for existing homes and 40 per cent of the price of new homes. There will be 10,000 places within the scheme each year over four years. I understand that the eligibility criteria for the scheme will include income thresholds of around $90,000 for a single-income purchaser and $120,000 for two people. There will also be property price caps in the scheme, depending on whether you're buying in the city or the country. You will not have to be a first-home buyer to access Help to Buy; you could be close to retirement or starting out in the workforce and seeking the stability of homeownership. It will be open not just to couples but to siblings or to a parent and their adult child. This is really important. There is an assumption that, once you get on the property ladder, you'll be fine, but this isn't always the case. There are many people out there whose life circumstances, through divorce, illness or natural disaster, can change over time. So do their housing needs. A small and suitably targeted equity scheme is seen by some experts as an appropriate response to Australia's housing crisis, helping people who might otherwise be unable to buy a home and experience the stability that comes with this to do so. I want to pause and emphasise small and targeted here. Many experts, including the Productivity Commission, the Grattan Institute and the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, are clear that, unless a shared-equity scheme like Help to Buy is well targeted at those experiencing persistent marginalisation in the housing market, there is a risk of further increasing housing demand and, subsequently, housing prices. This program must be targeted at those who without it would not enter the property market at all. This includes low-income and historically disadvantaged people. That's why I support the member for Goldstein's amendment, which would add that a purpose of the scheme is to assist this cohort, such as single women nearing retirement. The amendment also requires a review of the scheme to consider whether it's actually achieving its objectives. Targeted cohorts should also include those in rural and remote areas where there is market stagnation, something the Regional Australia Institute have been calling for. The scheme should not be used to help people who were always going to enter the housing market; it shouldn't be used just to get them in sooner. I understand that the government intends to put the eligibility requirements for the scheme, including income thresholds and price caps, in written program directions determined by the minister, which she intends to consult on. So I urge the minister to listen to the experts and the evidence when it comes to writing these directions to make sure that they are appropriately targeted. This is why I also support the member for Wentworth's amendment, which would make these written program directions disallowable legislative instruments. It's critical that parliament has oversight over Help to Buy to ensure that the right people can access it and to guard against unintended consequences, such as increasing property prices. This amendment would also address stakeholder concerns that the bill lacks detail. For example, it's currently unclear whether the Commonwealth, who under this bill will own a share of the equity, will benefit from any improvements that the homeowner adds to the property or whether the Commonwealth will share in the risk that the property may lose value. The government must borrow about $5.5 billion to run this scheme, and with so much money at stake it's important that the parliament has a say about where this money is going and how it's being used. I know the government called for similar oversight and recording of spending when they were in opposition. I was here. I heard them say it all the time, including when the then coalition government were making executive decisions about billions of dollars of COVID spending. I remind you I was here. I heard you. I think you should do the same now. This government has a habit of complaining about flaws in governance while in opposition and then not doing much about them once in government. So I urge them to change that now and make the minister's written directions on Help to Buy disallowable by parliament. Deal the parliament in. While this bill is welcome, it's not the transformational change we need to improve the housing crisis. The government must put everything on the table. We need to consider and engage with discussions about reforming negative gearing and capital gains tax discount. We need to look at everything. Most importantly, the government must keep working on supply measures. It is absolutely fundamental to solving this crisis. All three of these experts I just mentioned—the Grattan Institute, the Productivity Commission and the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute—clearly say that to mitigate against the Help to Buy scheme increasing property prices the government must focus on increasing housing supply. The experts are saying it, and I'm constantly hearing about it on the ground in my electorate of Indi and whenever I talk to regional Australians. Earlier this month, I joined more than 300 people from across regional, rural and remote Australia at the National Regional Housing Summit, hosted by the Regional Australia Institute. Local governments, real estate businesses, housing developers, lenders, community housing providers and more converged to speak about the lack of housing they're experiencing, what this means for rural and regional communities and, most importantly, how to solve this crisis. Throughout the day, I heard again and again that housing affordability schemes like the Help to Buy scheme are fine but simply will not do much to address this huge housing crisis in regional and rural towns. We need measures to build more homes. One of these measures is to help local councils to build the critical enabling infrastructure that sets up the land so that homes can be built. Funding is needed to connect essential services. Powerlines and pipes, sewerage and drainage infrastructure: these are absolutely key to unlocking regional housing supply. It's what the nine local councils in my electorate—plus water management authorities and housing developers—keep telling me consistently. Take Wangaratta, for example. I've spoken about it many times in the House, and I'm going to say it again: it is the second-largest town in my electorate. Wangaratta is struggling to build more homes because it has run out of sewerage infrastructure. It's why, since 2022, I've been campaigning for a $2 billion regional housing infrastructure fund so that money for critical enabling infrastructure will go to where it is needed—to regional and rural Australia. I met with the Prime Minister last August and presented my proposal for a regional housing infrastructure fund. We had a really great conversation. Just a week later, following a national cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister announced the Housing Support Program for 'targeted activation payments for things like connecting essential services and amenities to support new housing development'. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? This is why it is so important, I reckon, to have a strong regional independent voice in the parliament to go and speak to the Prime Minister and tell him what we need. I listen to my communities about the problems we face. I work with them to develop solutions. I took those solutions to government and I'm pleased to say it's clear that they are listening. But—there is a big but here—$500 million for the Housing Support Program is not nearly enough. It doesn't touch the sides. And according to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, it is being committed for only two years. At a minimum, we need at least 30,000 new homes to meet the demand in regional Australia, and it costs about $75,000 to build the infrastructure needed to unlock a new home. This means, if my sums are correct—and I'm pretty good on the maths—we need $2 billion to unlock that demand, and that's only for regional Australia. The Housing Support Program is for local councils both in the cities and in the country. It is not a dedicated fund to meet regional needs, and I am really concerned that when the program is up and running our needs in rural Australia will be crowded out by louder voices from the major cities with more planners and more capacity to put in applications. I'm really worried about that. It's why last year I also introduced my 'unlocking regional housing' private members bill, which would require housing funding for critical enabling infrastructure to be directed to regional, rural and remote Australia. I also moved amendments to the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill so that funding could be directed towards local councils for critical enabling infrastructure. I also sought for the HAFF's investment mandate to be amended so that 30 per cent of the HAFF's $10 billion will fund social and affordable housing in regional, rural and remote areas proportionate to the numbers of people who live there. These amendments were not supported by the government, and they're yet to back my 'unlocking regional housing' private members bill and my $2 billion regional housing infrastructure fund, but it is not too late—get in and do it. I really don't think you can continue to ignore my calls for rural and regional Australia for much longer. At the end of the national housing summit this month, the Regional Australia Institute, Master Builders Australia and the Real Estate Institute of Australia issued a communique with clear policy investment and innovation recommendations to address the housing crisis. One recommendation was for 'dedicated and increased housing funding for regional local governments for'—guess what!—'critical enabling infrastructure'. With this Help to Buy Bill, the experts are clearly warning that the government must focus their attention on supply measures. Rental vacancy rates, interest rates and, most worryingly, homelessness rates are all looking increasingly dire for regional Australia. The problem is not getting better, so the government must listen and they must act. I will support this bill, as I said, but I won't do so with loads of enthusiasm or fanfare, because until the government really commit to ongoing, dedicated funding to address housing supply in regional, rural and remote Australia they're simply not doing enough to address this housing crisis. I will be unapologetic in this House for as long as I have the privilege to hold the seat of Indi to stick up for rural and regional Australia, and to come forward with good ideas, good policy well thought out, and a collaboration of people getting behind it. I urge the government to listen on this. Australia is in the midst of a housing crisis. It's being felt in every corner of the country, especially in Warringah, where house prices now average $2.3 million. Median rents in Warringah are $625, well above the New South Wales average of $420.  For some, this crisis is nearing catastrophe. Just last week, a homeless-outreach worker from LocalKind, formerly Community Northern Beaches, and the Manly Observer reached out on social media seeking to stop a pregnant woman and her partner from imminent homelessness, as they had to leave their rental accommodation. The outreach worker, Jessica Meadows, told the Manly Observer: The couple are expecting a baby in June but are about to become homeless … With the lack of affordable housing and long queues at viewings they have not yet secured a new tenancy … The partner is still working full time and can contribute $500 a week while they continue to apply for long term rentals throughout the duration of their stay. Luckily, the outreach meant the couple were able to secure four weeks of accommodation at Mission Australia and a potential granny flat for six months following that. That will mean the couple will be able to bring their soon-to-be newborn somewhere safe and secure. But it's hardly a solution. It highlights just how much change is needed across this area. What it shows is that this housing crisis is, in fact, verging on catastrophe for many Australians. We need to do more on housing and address supply by both building and ensuring greater availability of rental properties. In an earlier debate in this place when we discussed the HAFF, it was interesting that there was very little discussion around the kinds of standards in relation to the housing that would be funded—whether there would be a prioritisation around efficiency and climate adapted and resilient buildings, or whether there would be a focus on building that is effective and efficient to ensure it can be done more rapidly. The lack of housing supply is a wicked, complex problem that will require all levels of government—federal, state and local—to work together. It will take a huge shift in policy. It will need an end to politicising for political gain rather than looking at the long-term view and benefit for society. The current state of play is that house prices in Sydney have risen more than 11 per cent in the last 12 months. Greater Sydney's median dwelling price has climbed to $1.12 million over the past year, with more than 90 per cent of suburbs increasing in value. In Warringah, the average house price of around $2.3 million is an increase of around eight per cent over the previous 12 months and an increase of around 37 per cent over the previous five years—a 37 per cent increase! The percentage of Australians renting, some 31 per cent, is near its highest point within the last three decades. In Warringah, it's nearly 35 per cent of residents. Interest rates are also putting huge stress on those with high mortgages. Those facing stress include many Warringah residents who may be fortunate enough to be earning high salaries but are also paying exorbitantly high prices. The evidence over several years from local organisations such as One Meal and LocalKind Northern Beaches shows a dramatic increase in demand for homelessness services in the community locally. We have several hundred homeless people on the Northern Beaches. Every night in Australia there are around 120,000 homeless people sleeping rough. We have a need of around 300 to 400 social housing units within just the Northern Beaches Council area every year. Added to this is domestic violence, which is in every community, including the Northern Beaches. Our domestic violence shelters are full, and many women have nowhere to go. Northern Beaches Women's Shelter has to turn away some 25 women a month. They need more affordable housing and more transitional and emergency accommodation, but there will never be enough. We must flip this dynamic, introducing a presumption for women and children to stay in the family home and giving greater support to programs like Staying Home Leaving Violence. This program works in cooperation with New South Wales police to remove violent partners from the family home so that the other partner and children can stay safe. We also need policies to address intergenerational inequity. There are so many that are feeling so despondent about their prospects. It's concerning that so many young people feel that homeownership is now unreachable because of the obstacles the current housing market has created. So what are the solutions to the housing crisis? What is the road map, and how do we implement it? There are some solutions, and this bill is a start. I would say it's not an ambitious start, but it is a start. There are other solutions as well, some of which have been spoken about in this place. I've spoken about some of these solutions before, but it's now more important than ever to raise them again. One of the key levers the federal government can use to address this is of course tax reform—a hot topic in recent weeks—by, for a start, supporting state governments to transition from the inefficient tax of stamp duty to a general property tax. Stamp duties are inefficient taxes. They discourage people from moving to housing that better suits their needs. Proposals to make the shift are difficult to achieve because of the initial loss of tax revenue for the state. The federal government should commit to filling part of the revenue hole arising should a state government wish to swap stamp duties for property taxes, including any reduction in the state's share of GST. We know that there are too many dwellings in Australia, particularly in Warringah, where we have empty-nesters. We have a large dwelling, but the children have moved out; they're adults. But there is no incentive in the system to assist people in downsizing. Instead, they've paid off their home, but you then hit them with a stamp duty tax if they try and move or downsize. So there's just no incentive in the system at all at the moment to help solve this problem. Of course, supply will be dealt with by building more, but it has to also look at incentivising that downsizing so that you free up what supply there actually is. Proposals to make the shift are often difficult because they get politicised and weaponised. But still we now are at a crisis point. Increases to Commonwealth rent assistance and better targeting of the scheme is another lever that should be considered to address the growing rates of housing stress and homelessness, especially amongst older women, who are the fastest-growing group suffering homelessness. Rent assistance works; we know that. In 2021 it reduced housing stress levels for recipients nationwide from 72 per cent to 46 per cent, but the maximum rate of rent assistance hasn't kept pace with the rising rents paid by low-income renters. I remind you that the average rent in Warringah is $620 a week. That simply is not going to allow anyone to house themselves on rent assistance. The government needs to review rent assistance to ensure that it is at an adequate level. In parallel with this, governments should consider incentives for providing long-term lease arrangements to increase housing security and stability in the rental market. There is so much more we can do. We are far behind European countries when it comes to renter rights and incentives to ensure that longer leases are provided. There just isn't anything like the kind of acceptance or mechanisms in place in Australia compared to overseas. So there is so much more to be done, and I call on the government to focus on that, because there's no doubt, as we head into another election—probably by next year—that housing and intergenerational equity will very much be on the agenda. Young people want to know there are solutions, but the party that forms government needs to have solutions around this. What does the bill before us do? The Help to Buy Bill will help some get into owning their own homes. Help to Buy is set up as a shared-equity scheme, and it will give successful applicants a Commonwealth equity contribution of up to 30 per cent of the purchase price of an existing home and up to 40 per cent for a new home. The number of applicants is limited to 10,000 per year for four years. There are caps at certain price levels which vary according to locations, and it's capped at certain income levels. It's limited to applicants with no current other properties, and it requires applicants to provide a two per cent deposit and demonstrate other financial capabilities. These are all good measures. The government will retain an equity share in the property, making it a part owner, thus reducing the amount of the loan which the buyer will have to pay off. But, in order to achieve sole ownership of the property, eventually the owner would have to buy out the equity. The current cap for Sydney properties is set at $950,000, so it's more than likely that this will not help many in Warringah, where the median house price is more than double that. I would urge the minister to keep a watching brief and adjust property and salary thresholds further once the program is fully established and shown to be effective. Such caps won't be locked into the legislation. The big advantage is that only the two per cent deposit is required. Raising the necessary deposit has of course been a huge barrier to people entering the housing market, so this will be a relief to many who don't have other means of raising the deposit. The scheme will also help many older Australians, especially many older single women, and to that effect I support the amendments moved by the member for Goldstein in assisting a focus on women. Just 34 per cent of women who separate from their partner and lose the house in those proceedings manage to purchase another home within five years, and that statistic gets even worse because only 44 per cent of women do so within 10 years. So imagine five years after separation or some 10 years after you still have less than half of those women have been able to rehouse themselves. By contrast, 42 per cent of men separating after a divorce or separation buy a home within five years, and 55 per cent within 10 years. There's a clear discrepancy in outcome upon separation when that occurs. That is why it comes as no surprise that women over 55 are at the highest risk of homelessness. The member for Wentworth has also introduced an amendment I strongly support, which is to bring more review over the process and make it a disallowable instrument. It's very important when we're talking about so much public money and such an important scheme that everything be reviewable and that there be diligence and accountability in this place. I support this bill. I do welcome what it brings to the table in starting to help homeownership for those who simply cannot do it at the moment. There are grave fears that it will raise prices because it will increase demand. Clearly the pendulum needs to be matched with an increase in supply to ensure that prices aren't raised. There are many other aspects that need to be looked at by the government. In Warringah there is a high level of foreign ownership of real estate and homes and there's a high level of vacancy of homes, yet there is still no mechanism that really addresses those issues. I think there are a number of areas where federal, state and local governments need to work together to look at whether we're fully occupying and fully utilising the homes and the stock we already have and whether we're prioritising the means by which we can increase supply and have more available. Every tool in the toolbox is needed to help alleviate the current crisis and ensure that younger Australians, in particular, can realise their dream of homeownership. If we choose not to change our policy and to implement new policy, the crisis will turn into catastrophe for many more Australians. I urge the government to be bold and courageous and to look at more solutions. This is a good start but more action is needed. And, of course, when we talk of home building and increasing supplies, please stop allowing and enabling building in danger-prone areas. Only today I met with insurers so concerned at the catastrophic level of risk that so much housing stock is exposed to from the impacts of climate change including floods in flood zones. We are facing a disaster—an absolute cliff—where so much housing will not be insurable. And, if it is not insurable, you have no means of balancing the equity for mortgages and you are going to have a situation where the government will need to stand in and solve this problem. So we can't be building more supply in a way that is reckless to the risks that we have ahead. I urge the government to work with state governments to ensure that we are not opening up areas that are high risk for development. Developers should bear a much greater cost. A proposal that was put to me today was that we should actually have green, yellow and red warnings in our conveyancing contracts in relation to the risk exposure of properties do that a buyer is aware that you are on notice and developers will have to carefully consider whether that land is the best place to develop. Lastly, I should say to everyone in Warringah, I will be hosting a housing forum in the coming months to hear your views and to be able to come forward with solutions to ensure our young people can stay local, can stay and work and have their families in our area in an affordable way. Today I stand before you to shed light on the challenges and concerns surrounding the Help to Buy legislation, which holds the promise of aiding first-time buyers. However, as we delve into the details, it becomes apparent that the journey from promise to operation has been far from seamless. Firstly, let's acknowledge that the only housing policies currently providing support to first home buyers are those inherited from the former coalition government. The Albanese government, despite announcing this legislation over 20 months ago, has seemingly dragged its heels in introducing it as a policy. The Help to Buy policy, a key electoral promise, was slated to commence on 1 January 2023—  Sorry to interrupt you, member for Capricornia. In accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier today, debate is adjourned and resumption of the debate will be an order of the day at the next sitting.

As my electorate is home to the third-largest business centre in Australia, including over 28,000 small businesses, potential new challenges are felt very quickly and keenly by those I represent.  Recently my office has been overrun with concerns expressed about the significant impact of ATO process changes made in November last year, with many small businesses reporting that they simply do not have the resources or administrative expertise to do battle with the bureaucratic behemoth. A local accountant recently explained the challenge to me, saying the new procedure has created a significant new administrative hurdle for small business. In the past, when a business's paperwork got out of hand, owners could leave everything with their accountant to lodge returns through the tax portal. It was pretty straightforward. But the changes introduced in November now mean a business must get a myGovID, link their company or trust to it, which requires hours on the phone, and then log into their business portal, scroll to find their accountant and send their accountant an invitation, which at the end of the day only allows the accountant to act on their behalf for 12 months, which then means the business has to do it all again in just a year's time. In just a fortnight, this accountant had had three small businesses come to him with insurmountable problems due to this change. Given there are thousands of similarly sized accountancy practices, I can only imagine the likely scale of this problem. The irony for the accountant I spoke to is that, due to the difficulty of navigating this new system, he has resorted to submitting paper tax returns by mail. This is leading to enormous stress, as fines keep accruing for unpaid tax and the process to have the fines forgiven has its own challenges. I've heard from constituents who have effectively been forced into unreasonable payment plans because the alternative is enforced liquidation. Businesses used to have a case worker to help them negotiate a repayment plan, but these too are gone. Instead, people are basically trying to negotiate with an unresponsive computer system. Quite simply, small businesses haven't been appropriately educated, and the time and resources to help them are nowhere to be found. If robodebt has taught us anything, it should be that government procedures can be destructive and have a destructive impact on individuals when people's lived experiences are not heeded. Yet I am concerned we are witnessing something similar in relation to small businesses and the ATO. Given this, I urge the government, as a matter of urgency, to please act now to modify harmful processes, while it's the alarm that's sounding rather than livelihoods and lives collapsing.","Small Business: Taxation","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TINK (North Sydney) ","(15:59):"

The organisation was founded by Dr Nilofar Ebrahimi, a medical doctor and former member of parliament in Afghanistan, where she was an important advocate for Afghan women. She founded ZamZam in 2019 to support and empower orphans, youth and families in distress and to help young women enrol in universities. When the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Dr Ebrahimi left her home country and moved to Canberra, where she has continued her critical work.  ZamZam's work supports people in Afghanistan with their basic needs to live, including providing them with food and supply packs that can feed a family for a month, with winter clothes for orphans and widows, and with cash, which is highly important in Afghanistan. ZamZam also aims to get girls into schools and women into university. That's despite the increasing barriers to female education that have been put up by the Taliban. ZamZam also works hard in Australia to support newly arrived Afghan refugees and help them settle into their new lives here, including helping with driving lessons and swimming lessons and community programs here in Canberra. Sunday's fundraiser gave attendees the opportunity to buy beautiful clothing and jewellery made by women and girls in Afghanistan whose education is supported by ZamZam. Their work is critical and should be commended, and I recommend that people have a look at their website and support them if they can. Last week, I also had the opportunity to visit UNSW Canberra to hear about their major plans for the future. I am fortunate enough to have five universities in my electorate. UNSW Canberra has a long history associated with the Australian Defence Force college. They recently announced their intention to provide specialised degrees for graduates who want to pursue careers in security and defence industry, two very important industries here in Canberra. They want to become a research institution and are well on their way to doing so. UNSW Canberra Launch is a collaborative workspace that will bring together industry, government and university to grow innovation and capability in the defence and security sectors. I was lucky to visit the Skykraft workshop and found that they are building satellites just around the corner from my office in the middle of Civic. Their plan is to build these satellites to make air-traffic surveillance and communications easier, specifically over remote regions and the ocean. To support their big changes, UNSW Canberra are planning to build a world-class campus on the old CIT Reid campus. The campus will be developed in close proximity to the defence buildings and will focus on creating graduates that have the skills and knowledge that are key to developing defence capability.","Canberra Electorate: ZamZam Foundation, Canberra Electorate: UNSW Canberra","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PAYNE (Canberra) ","(16:02):"

I want to reflect a little on those agreements and on the achievements of the Morrison government in mental health. I was his assistant minister on mental health and suicide prevention for 18 months from December 2020 until the election, and I do feel that the Prime Minister's legacy in this area is quite significant.  In the 2021-22 budget, the Morrison government committed a record investment of $2.3 billion into mental health and suicide prevention. One of the really important initiatives was the establishment of Head to Health—more than half a billion dollars provided in that budget. That set Head to Health on the path of being what would ultimately become the even larger mental health organisation that headspace is today. Head to Health is about providing free community based support for people who are struggling with mental health issues who perhaps aren't getting the support they need through the hospital system but who need more support than can be provided simply through GPs and local psychologists. In time there'll be more than 100 Head to Health centres around the country. It's very pleasing to see that the Albanese government is continuing to roll out those Head to Health centres. It's something that we're very proud of. A very serious but extremely important topic is what's known as aftercare. This is when people are released from hospital after a suicide attempt. In Australia a few years ago only about half of people who were discharged from hospital in that most serious of situations actually received follow-up care in the community. These people are in a very serious situation. Through the agreement with the states and territories, all states and territories and the Commonwealth committed, both in word and in financial deed, to make that universal so that 100 per cent of Australians will get at least three months support in the community upon discharge in that most serious of situations. I'm very proud that we were able to do that. Eating disorders are another issue that touches so many families in Australia, and the commitment of the Morrison government to establish a world-leading research centre into eating disorders was also a very important achievement of this period. Prime Minister Morrison was extremely genuine and sincere in his desire to have a very positive impact on the mental health system in Australia. He can be proud of his legacy.","Morrison Government: Mental Health","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr COLEMAN (Banks) ","(16:05):"

We might make other artefacts in Australia that are as large as ships, but there are none as complex. In terms of our sovereign manufacturing capacity, our ability to make the things that are most important to us and to be a nation of which it can be said that we are capable of making anything, the significance of our shipbuilding businesses and workforce cannot be overstated. That's why the Albanese government's commitment to a continuous shipbuilding program at Henderson in my electorate is so welcome. That program, which was announced by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Industry last week, is unprecedented in its scale and duration. It is of course principally focused on meeting our maritime security and humanitarian response needs, by growing our fleet from 11 to 26 vessels and by delivering new vessels sooner than under the plan we inherited. It will guarantee the continuity and, indeed, the growth of shipbuilding expertise and jobs in Western Australia for decades to come. It delivers billions of dollars of new investment that will sustain a manufacturing ecosystem, spanning hundreds of small- and medium-sized businesses.  At present, the Henderson precinct is engaged in building four Arafura class offshore patrol vessels and two Cape class patrol vessels, alongside the work involved in upgrading our Anzac class frigates. We have already brought forward the work for delivering the Army's new landing craft medium and landing craft heavy, which will be undertaken by Birdon and Austal. As a result of this government's Defence Strategic Review, we're now committed to building eight new frigates as well as six cutting-edge optionally crewed surface vessels. The scale and carefully programmed nature of this work will be the foundation of long-term employment for more than 1,200 Western Australians. As I suggested earlier, the essential ingredient of our sovereign shipbuilding capacity is our skilled and highly committed maritime workforce. That's why we've already taken key steps to improve education and training opportunities, not least through the provision of 180,000 fee-free TAFE places across Australia. That has already benefitted the education of 19,700 Western Australians. All this does stand in contrast to the decade that preceded us under the previous government. The fact is that we inherited a fleet in decline, with our Navy being asked to make do with the oldest operational service fleet in Australia since the end of World War II. We're not going to allow that to remain the case. As an island continent, we must have a properly equipped Navy and we must maintain a first-rate standard of sovereign shipbuilding capacity. The Albanese Labor government sees that very clearly, and we're taking action to make sure that the shipbuilding hub at the Australian Marine Complex at Henderson, in my electorate of Fremantle, is secure and growing in its role as a national centre of manufacturing excellence.","Shipbuilding Industry, Defence Procurement","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) ","(16:08):"

Over the past five years, or almost five years, in this role, I've held many forums and many round tables, on aged care, youth, industry and getting through COVID. There was a common theme here, and that common theme was mental health and the state of mental health in all of our electorates.  One thing that our government—the coalition government—did at that time was to increase the Medicare-rebated appointments for mental health from 10 to 20. Doctors around my electorate were very grateful for that increase, because they were telling me that over 30 per cent of their consultations were mental health consultations. That is a huge number when you consider, for example, that in my electorate, 27 per cent of the population is over the age of 65—you would think the majority of care would be for aged-care health issues. To have 30 per cent of doctor and GP consultations about mental health is enormous. We can imagine the disappointment when those 20 visits were reduced by the current government, down to 10. There's a young lady in my electorate by the name of Fleur Davies, who started a petition late last year crying out to have the number of sessions reinstated to 20. That petition amassed thousands of signatures across my electorate. In response to the petition, the Minister for Health and Aged Care proceeded to list the issues and figures around the programs. What he didn't do is list the number of participants from regional areas, or Cowper specifically, nor did he show any compassion for or understanding of those who can't afford access to these programs without the Medicare rebates. He concluded his letter with: 'I note your concerns on the case of mental health sessions. While the government is responsible for setting the level of Medicare rebates for services, professionals are free to set their own fees and some of these may exceed the level of Medicare rebates.' What he has done, effectively, is blame the psychologist or counsellor. Minister, what you need to do is reinstate those Medicare rebates back up to 20 sessions, and do the right thing.","Cowper Electorate: Mental Health","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONAGHAN (Cowper) ","(16:11):"

Last week, I was honoured to mark this occasion with the federal Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories, Kristy McBain; the member for South Coast, Liza Butler; the New South Wales Premier; and the New South Wales minister for regional roads. It is, after all, a significant achievement that has been a long time in the making and one that I am proud to have joined with the community years before to help make a reality. I pay tribute to local community organisation Vincentia Matters and, in particular, Liz Tooley, who has spearheaded the successful community campaign.  The Princes Highway-Jervis Bay intersection is the busiest and most crash-prone intersection to the Victorian border. It has been the location of 15 crashes over the past five years, resulting in six serious crashes. It is the main gateway to Huskisson and Jervis Bay. In peak times, locals and tourists know all about the long queues that can be seen backed up on Jervis Bay Road. But what did the local Liberals propose all those years ago for this intersection? A roundabout. The community had their say about that—that it just would not be good enough. A community petition was started for a flyover, which quickly gained signatures. I gladly walked that petition around the streets of Vincentia. It gained over 14,000 signatures. It was then New South Wales deputy opposition leader Yasmin Catley who presented the petition in the New South Wales parliament. Let me be clear, it was the community I wholeheartedly supported that was responsible for the current plan for the Jervis Bay flyover. I called for federal funding to be brought forward and was pleased to secure $100 million in federal funding delivered by the Albanese Labor government, together with $64 million by the Minns Labor government. The total project cost is $164 million. The new intersection upgrade will deliver a grade-separated flyover-style intersection and an overpass across the Princes Highway with a roundabout on each side of Jervis Bay Road to deliver safer and smoother connections it. It will include a multimodal facility which will include parking, park and ride, and pathways. This upgrade will expand the Princes Highway to two lanes in each direction on the approaches to the intersection and include longer entry and exit lanes, as well as free-flowing access to the highway when travelling north and south. At least 110 jobs will be created during construction, with contractor SRG Global Civil delivering the project to be completed in up to four years. I cannot wait to open the Jervis Bay flyover, along with my community.","Gilmore Electorate: Roads","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(16:14):"

Unfortunately, Hamas's attack in October of last year has made it incredibly difficult to see a solution for that part of the world.  One of the reasons that I have been a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine is I desperately didn't want this to become a political division in this country. Sadly, I've completely failed in that attempt. What I call the protest classes—the extremists—who might think they're helping the Palestinian people are also doing enormous harm, because it's an excuse not to worry about the deaths of nearly 30,000 people if the people who are speaking up for them and the ones who get the attention don't have the credibility with the broader community. All I ask is that we don't take sides, that we look at a resolution for that area and that we understand that a child who has been killed by stray bullets or a child who is suffering from malnutrition and illness is an innocent person regardless of whether they're Israeli or Palestinian. We must not forget our humanity and become a cheer squad for one side or the other in this country. We are not doing the people of the Middle East any favours. We need to have a measured approach. We need a ceasefire so that this can be sorted through. This is one of the most frustrating times in my 16 years in this place. I know it's a long way away but, when you've been there and you've seen through your own eyes the conditions on the ground in that part of the world, you have a responsibility as a human being and as a member of parliament to try to do what you can to make a difference. I know I'm outnumbered on this issue, but I'm just asking people to think of the humanity rather than just taking sides.","Middle East","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr COULTON (Parkes—Chief Nationals Whip) ","(16:17):"

I think there's a lot of agreement on this side with the words that he said.  I'm very pleased to talk about our tax cuts and what they mean for the people of Australia and, in particular, my electorate. I know that my constituents are feeling the bite of cost-of-living pressures, particularly when it comes to housing. My electorate has some of the highest rents in the country, and that's why I'm very proud to be part of a government that has invested in housing. We've invested billions of dollars in the Housing Affordability Fund and we're trying to get 'help to buy' through the parliament at the moment, and it would be great if the Greens and Liberals didn't team up to block it. But right now, one thing we can do is back the bigger tax cuts that our side of parliament is proposing. In my electorate, this would put more money in the pockets of more people at a time when they're doing it tough. Every working Australian would receive a tax cut from 1 July. That's 13.6 million people. In my electorate, what that means is that 112,000 people would receive an average tax cut of $1,915; 86,000 taxpayers would receive a bigger tax cut than they would have under the proposal of the previous government, and 76 per cent of all taxpayers in my electorate would receive a bigger tax cut than they would have received from Scott Morrison's proposal. We want people to earn more. We want them to keep more of what they earn, after a decade of wage stagnation. And that's the other bit of good news that I'm delighted to share with this place: seeing real wages growing for the first time through the largest pay increases in 14 years in the most recent wage price index, is so great. Real wages growth is back. We on this side always back higher minimum wages for Australian workers. We want to see those flow through to awards. We were prepared to back that 15 per cent pay increase for the aged-care sector. And, of course, 90 per cent of those aged-care workers are women. I also really want to say how pleased I am to see the ABS figures on the gender pay gap. The gender pay gap has dropped to 12 per cent, the lowest level on record. I'm very proud of the contribution that our changes to industrial relations laws have made, including things like the Workplace Gender Equality Agency reports into the pay gap into the private sector. Having large Australian companies report their gender pay gap will have an impact over time. We're getting on with it. We're helping people with the cost of living through tax cuts, through housing and through wages.","Taxation","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney—Minister for the Environment and Water) ","(16:20):"

I wish to draw the attention of parliament to the plight of more than 100 elderly Western Australian retirees who lost their life savings in the financial collapse of the Sterling First rent-for-life scheme.  The recent Senate inquiry into the Sterling Income Trust was critical of the regulatory failures of both ASIC and the Western Australian Department of Consumer Protection. From 2015, ASIC began receiving complaints that the directors of Sterling First had misrepresented the scheme and that the directors were serial Ponzi offenders associated with previously collapsed schemes resulting in millions of dollars in losses. The human impact has been devastating, with many vulnerable senior citizens facing severe financial hardship and homelessness. In a bid to secure some form of redress, the victims have formed the Sterling First Action Group and are currently pursuing a class action through the courts. A grassroots community campaign is being fought to provide justice for the victims of the failed scheme. It is in the public interest to reveal that the current president of the Liberal Party's HillarysBranch, Kirsten Marie, served as a director of the responsible entity, Theta Asset Management, alongside her husband, Robert Patrick Marie, who was fined $100,000 by ASIC and banned for four years from controlling an entity carrying on a financial services business. Theta Asset Management was also fined $2 million by ASIC and forced into liquidation for its role in the $16.7 million collapse. It is clearly untenable for individuals who have been sanctioned by ASIC to occupy senior office bearer positions within the Liberal Party. To date the media has been reluctant to report on this fact. It is a major financial scandal and an embarrassment for the Liberal Party. Questions need to be asked about the circumstances in which Kirsten Mariecame to be installed as president of the Hillarys Branch of the Liberal Party, because it is evident that her continued involvement in the senior role is untenable. What role does Simon Ehrenfeld, president of the Moore division and a candidate for Liberal Party preselection, play in exerting control over the Hillarys branch in conjunction with Robert and Kirsten Marie? On behalf of my constituents, the victims of the Sterling First financial scam, I call upon Kirsten Marie and Robert Patrick Marie to resign their positions within the Liberal Party immediately. A grassroots community campaign is being mobilised to fight for justice for the victims of the failed scheme.","Financial Security","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOODENOUGH (Moore—Second Deputy Speaker) ","(16:23):"

It's true but it's ironic, because residents in Point Cook have long had to put up with inadequate mobile phone coverage.  Late last year I surveyed residents about their experiences with poor mobile coverage and connectivity. They told me stories about how poor connectivity impacted them every day: stories of disrupted online education; of remote work proving difficult, if not impossible; of being unable to reach family and friends because their connection was too poor; and, most concerningly of all, of how lack of reception saw some Point Cook residents concerned that they would be unable to contact emergency services when they needed to. The message was clear: telecommunications providers needed to lift their game in the area. I used the results of this survey to make the case directly to the CEOs of Telstra and Optus. I told them about my constituents' experiences and my expectation that they lift their game. My staff have met with representatives of the companies to go through these issues in detail. In response I've been told that Telstra is now building two new mobile phone towers in Point Cook. Site acquisition for these towers has escalated since my community consultation. These new phone towers will provide improved 4G and 5G connectivity for Point Cook residents. Optus have advised that they plan to establish four new connectivity sites and to upgrade two existing sites over the next one to five years. These developments will mean that Telstra customers in Point Cook should start to see their connection improve, potentially as soon as in the next six months. The time line is less clear for Optus customers, but I'll continue working productively with them to speed up their telecommunications infrastructure. This is progress, but I'm continuing to push these providers to move more quickly and to deliver these much-needed infrastructure improvements as soon as possible. The Albanese Labor government is working to keep Australians connected across Melbourne's peri-urban fringe. We're rolling out the Peri-Urban Mobile Program—or PUMP—to improve connectivity in bushfire priority areas and across greater Melbourne in conjunction with the Victorian government. I've implored mobile phone carriers to take advantage of this program if it will help them to improve their mobile coverage for residents in fast-growing peri-urban areas of Melbourne, like Point Cook in my electorate. This complements the Mobile Black Spot Program, which aims to improve mobile coverage across regional and remote Australia. The Albanese government believes that your mobile connection should not be determined by your postcode. Before the last election we made it clear that under our government no Australian would be held back and no Australian would be left behind. I'll keep pushing to ensure that all Point Cook residents have better mobile connectivity so that they can get on with living their lives, running their businesses, getting their study done and communicating with their friends and families.

While the veteran community broadly welcomed the Douglas decision of 2020 and many veterans have benefited from that decision, we were alerted to concerns that a number of veterans were facing higher end-of-year tax liabilities as a result.  For context, the Douglas decision found that anyone who was receiving military invalidity benefits, paid under the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme or the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, on or after September 2007 should be taxed as superannuation lump sums rather than superannuation income streams. For many, this did provide a tax benefit. There's no doubt, though, that the Douglas decision was highly complex, and it has taken time to work through some of the consequences of this decision to make sure that there are no unintended consequences left unresolved. Labor committed to ensuring veterans were not left worse off as a consequence of the Douglas decision and the necessary legal changes flowing from it. Previously, these payments, under the MSBS and the DFRDB, were treated as asset test exemption income streams and defined as benefit income streams under both the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. A division having been called in the House of Representatives— Sitting suspended from 16:32 to 16:44 Mr KEOGH: As I was just explaining, the legislation that is before us today is part of Labor's commitment to ensuring that veterans are not left worse off as a consequence of the Federal Court's Douglas decision from 2020. The payments that flow to some veterans through the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme were previously, before the Douglas decision, treated under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act as asset-test-exempt income streams and defined as benefit income streams. As a result of the Douglas decision, the lump-sum payments may not now qualify as benefit income streams or be exempt from asset tests. This leads to a high degree of uncertainty and risk of unintended consequences for veterans. We want to fix this problem, and that's what this legislation is all about. We want to ensure that veterans have certainty to maintain equity in the system and fairness in the way that income support recipients are means-tested and the way in which their pay rates are determined. Today, we're looking to resolve these issues once and for all to ensure that veterans are no worse off following the Federal Court's decision. These new provisions in this bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Military Invalidity Payments Means Testing) Bill 2024, insert a new income stream classification and assessment regime into the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. These changes in the bill are designed to ensure the same assessment of income for invalidity payments and to ensure that invalidity payments continue to be treated as exempt from the assets test, clarifying the issues identified earlier. The new provisions are designed to ensure the same assessment of income for invalidity payments and to ensure that invalidity payments continue to be treated in the same way from an assets test point of view. This means that a person's invalidity payments that they may be receiving either through social security or under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, which are provided in recognition of the need for increased support due to service related conditions, are not negatively affected by other income or assets. This is intended to ensure that veterans and/or their partners receive a level of support that is consistent with the intent of that legislation and policy, before the unexpected findings that were delivered by the Federal Court in the Douglas decision. The last thing we want is to negatively impact those who have signed up to defend our nation. This bill seeks to ensure that no veteran is worse off as a result of the Douglas decision in the Federal Court, and I commend the bill to the House. The Full Federal Court's 2020 decision in Commissioner of Taxation v Douglas, commonly referred to now as the Douglas case, has created an unintended consequence for the means test applied to certain military invalidity benefit payments under existing legislation. These affected payments are invalidity benefits under the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme. Both schemes are now closed. The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Military Invalidity Payments Means Testing) Bill 2024 is required to ensure that veterans are no worse off following the Douglas decision. Given the commitment that our military personnel make to serving our nation, we have a moral obligation to ensure that, when they retire from the Australian Defence Force, we look after them and, certainly in situations such as this, that they are no worse off because of the unintended consequences of this case. It's important to fix this problem, to give veterans certainty, to maintain equity in the system and to ensure fairness in the way income support recipients are means-tested and their payment rates determined. It's vital to remember that these benefits are received by veterans who have served our country, and we owe it to them to ensure that legislation supports them in a fair and equitable manner. The government needs to amend legislation to ensure a clear and fair legal basis for assessing these payments within the income support system. This system provides targeted support to those who need it based on their income levels and circumstances. A key principle is to provide similar levels of support to people with similar means of supporting themselves. To maintain the system's equity and fairness to other income support recipients, these invalidity payments need to be assessed in line with how similar sources of income are assessed for other recipients. This bill aims to ensure that veterans and their partners continue to receive income support at a rate that aligns with the original intent of the legislation and policy before the Douglas decision and is consistent with entitlements for other income support recipients, including other veterans, under existing arrangements. The bill creates a new category of income stream in the Social Security Act and Veterans' Entitlements Act and a means-testing treatment designed to mirror the assessments obtained from the previous treatment before the Douglas decision. It inserts a new income stream classification and assessment regime under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. These new provisions aim to ensure the same assessment of income of invalidity payments and continued exemption of the invalidity payments from the assets test. This ensures that veterans and/or their partners receive a level of support consistent with the original intent of the legislation and policy, before the unexpected findings of the Douglas decision. This bill also preserves the validity of all relevant historical income and asset assessments relating to affected payments. Importantly, the changes to the bill do not alter the income tax benefits from the Douglas decision for veterans and/or their partners. This approach ensures these military invalidity benefits continue to be treated similarly in the means test for other comparable types of income. This bill also ensures that veterans receiving military invalidity benefits will receive similar income support outcomes as other veterans with retirement benefits from the same military schemes and other Australians with similar income levels. By passing this bill, we aim to maintain fairness and equity within the income support system and demonstrate our ongoing commitment to supporting our veterans, who have served our nation. We owe it to them to get this right, and that's what this bill does. I'm pleased to be summing up on behalf of the Minister for Social Services. The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Military Invalidity Payments Means Testing) Bill 2024 amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to establish a clear legal basis for means testing the income from military invalidity payments affected by the Full Federal Court's 2020 Douglas decision when recipients of those payments also seek support through our income support system. As the Minister for Social Services outlined in her second reading speech, as a result of the Douglas decision, we can no longer treat invalidity benefit payments from the Defence Force Retirements and Death Benefits Scheme and the Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme as asset-test-exempt defined benefit income streams in the social security means test. When we apply the framework used to assess income types in the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act, it is apparent that there's actually no explicit alternative means-testing treatment for these payments that we can use instead. The only alternative identified in existing legislation is clearly not intended for statutory superannuation benefits of this type, and analysis shows this alternative has significant legal risk and uncertainty, is unclear and would create inequities in the system, including amongst veterans themselves. That's why we need to establish a clear legal basis for means testing these payments in the social security system. One option would have been for the government to make amendments to classify these invalidity benefit payments as lump sums for the purposes of income support legislation. This would be similar to the way the payments were classified in tax law following the Douglas decision. But the Social Security Act and Veterans' Entitlements Act are not bound by the way different types of payments are classified in the tax system. In fact, if the lump-sum treatment were applied to these payments in the social security means test, these veterans would actually be worse off because it would have the effect of reducing recipients' rates of support, leaving them with less money in their pockets. That's why, with this bill, the Minister for Social Services is introducing a new classification of military invalidity pension income stream in the Social Security Act and Veterans' Entitlements Act, to cover the military invalidity payments that are impacted and affected by the Douglas decision. The assessment of the military invalidity pension income stream within the means test is designed to produce the same result as the historical assessments of the affected invalidity payments. In addition, the bill provides for military invalidity pension income streams to be considered asset-test-exempt income streams under the acts, ensuring that the payments remain exempt from the assets test for income support. In almost every case, the bill results in no change to the rate of income support veterans or their partners are currently receiving. Importantly, it would also mean veterans and their partners will continue to receive income support at a rate that is consistent with entitlements for other income support recipients under existing arrangements, including other DFRDB and MSBS veterans who receive retirement defined benefit income streams. In addition, the bill validates past assessments of the affected invalidity payments under the previous treatment, which may be invalid in light of the Douglas decision. It also gives the secretary of the Department of Social Services and the Repatriation Commission the power to create instruments under relevant acts to set out conditions under which other income stream payments can be classified as military invalidity pension income streams if this is required down the track. On behalf of the Minister for Social Services, I want to thank the member for Deakin and the opposition for indicating the bipartisan approach and support that has been taken by the coalition, and also the member for Deakin for engaging so positively and constructively with the minister's office and the minister herself on this really important legislation. With this bill, we are establishing a clear legal basis where currently there isn't one for means testing the income from those payments affected by the Douglas decision when recipients of these payments also seek support through our income support system. It's so important to give our veterans certainty. For those who have served our nation, this change maintains equality in the way different income support recipients are means tested and gives that certainty to it. Again, I acknowledge the bipartisan support from across the parliament on this very important change. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

"0","0","0","1","2","0","469","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2024. Many small businesses in Warringah are struggling right now. Some are even closing entirely. At the end of 2023, we had local institutions in Mosman shut up shop, including Brunskills Pharmacy, Savior Faire, Shane's Quality Butchery and Don Adan café—a vast variety of local businesses. They have been local favourites for over 30 years. Whilst there are a lot of pressures facing small- and medium-sized businesses right now—inflation, utility bills, less consumer spending—one other thing I always hear about when visiting small businesses is the difficulty and complexity of navigating our industrial relations laws, their fear of getting it wrong and the fact that it is constantly changing.  The government has now pushed through several legislative packages of major changes to our industrial relations laws, some of which we are still working through. It makes it difficult for small businesses to operate, especially when only about 43 per cent of them are breaking even. This bill is a classic example of the government doing a Senate deal and rushing through the legislation. I would argue it's poor policy, it hasn't been thought through and it hasn't been properly consulted on. The government is now having to clean up what happened through the rushed process. It only gives uncertainty and angst for businesses. It is not how we should be making policy in Australia. I respect the right to disconnect for employees, but by legislating it in the rushed way that we did—and we are now having to fix it—we are going to see unintended consequences. Many have heard about this in the media. What is the right to disconnect? It gives employees a right to disconnect from their employers' unreasonable contact outside of work hours. The difficulty of course is in the definition of 'unreasonable contact' and how that is interpreted. The change is partly a response to smartphones and working from home blurring the lines between work and personal life. We know that over the last few years with COVID many things have changed in our workplaces. While it is incredibly important to get the balance right, by legislating it in this way we are at risk of creating a real minefield for businesses. The right-to-disconnect amendment to the government's legislation came from Senate deliberations. It was not part of the suite of legislation that was put to the House. It was not part of a consultation process with COSBOA or BCA or business lobby groups. It hadn't had full consideration in the House before the government legislated it in the Senate. Now we're seeing it coming back to the House from the other place. In fact, we're having to pass this additional legislation because of the unintended consequence—or rather the effect of rushing to pass it—of including a criminal sanction in relation to this provision. No-one disagrees that employees need time to switch off, but we need to balance that with the need to get the job done, with productivity and with how businesses operate in a modern era with smartphones. We need to balance flexibility with being connected. The COVID-19 pandemic saw a huge change in the way many Australians work day to day. These changes have meant newfound flexibility for many, and that does make it harder to disconnect. Nevertheless, we don't want to lose the flexibility that many employers and employees alike value, because it has helped on both sides. For example, many women or families who need to deal with family commitments need to be able to leave the workplace, and they need to request more flexible arrangements. The converse is also true for employers. They will have difficulty in knowing what is going to be considered 'unreasonable contact' and during what times while continuing a willingness to provide more flexibility in relation to working arrangements. If this change in the law is used in a vexatious manner—which, let's get real, does happen—it will absolutely spook employers into winding back the flexible working arrangements that so many have come to enjoy. This amendment was rushed. We know that unintended consequences arise out of well-intentioned policymaking but rushed processes. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry stated that this sort of amendment is 'a blunt instrument which will do more harm than good'. They highlighted a tension, where technology has afforded employees more freedom to work unusual hours or to not be physically onsite but also assured employers that they are contactable if needed. That shows there is a level of nuance here that is worthy of greater scrutiny in order to get the policy balance right. How did we get here? Why must the government do this additional legislative clean-up? The second tranche of the government's closing loopholes legislation established the right to disconnect. This was established in the debate in the Senate on this legislation, where an amendment was sought to be made by the government to make clear that parties who breach a right-to-disconnect order issued by the Fair Work Commission are not committing a criminal offence. However, as so often happens here, political shenanigans and posturing were afoot, and the government were not granted leave for this amendment to be moved. Instead, we are taking up time in the House with an additional bill to do what that amendment was trying to do in the first place. This bill simply fixes that issue. It makes sure that noncompliance is a civil rather than a criminal offence, something which should have been done by amendment in the first place. But it does bring to light the broader problem in relation to this legislation and the processes of government in how these changes have occurred. This bill relates to the bill passed by the Senate a few weeks ago, and there's great concern in relation to some of the changes for casual workers. The government didn't give us enough of an opportunity to speak on the amended legislation at the time. In fact, it used its numbers to gag debate and rush it through, which is rather hypocritical in light of my having been in this place myself during the last term of government when the shoe was on the other foot and the now government complained about being gagged in those days. Good policymaking requires scrutiny and debate time. The definition of 'casual employee' and the conversion process have been amended in a way that is more palatable and, hopefully, practical for employees and employers. That would have been something I would have enjoyed the opportunity to debate when that bill came back from the Senate. Now there is one conversion process, initiated by an employee. That simplification is good. Businesses—and this was an amendment that was pushed for in the House but, as so often happens, was only agreed to by the government in the other place—only have to act on converting an employee from casual to part or full time if they receive a notification from the employee. Employees can initiate this after six months working for a bigger business or after 12 months working for a small or medium enterprise. This highlights yet another industrial relations issue we have, which is that there are currently 12 definitions of 'small business' in Commonwealth legislation. We will have more to say on this, and I'm urging the government to address that problem. Changes to the casual conversion process echo the amendments that the crossbench in the House had offered, and it's good to see that our efforts had some impact, since they were then agreed to in the other place. Overall, the changes that affect casual workers are not what is needed right now, I would argue, especially for small businesses, in light of current economic circumstances. They will still create complexity, uncertainty and more pressure for many that are already struggling to break even. Small businesses will continue to feel this pressure well into 2024. One of the biggest concerns I had with the original legislation was in relation to employee-like status and that threshold. This has also been amended in the other place, but of course we did not get the opportunity to comment on those amendments, because the government elected to gag debate. To be an employee-like worker, a person must satisfy two or more of the listed criteria, rather than one as in the original bill. There have now been some sensible changes introduced, refining what may be included for the Fair Work Commission to look at who is an employee-like worker and the scope of matters that will be included in minimum standard orders. This is a move in the right direction and provides more precision than existed in the original legislation. However, it is still a massive and complex change to the IR framework that will be complex and difficult for many to understand and implement, and with complexity comes uncertainty. Many of my constituents and businesses in Warringah will be affected by this new piece of legislation in relation to the right to disconnect, and quite possibly not in a positive way. I would argue to the government that we must look to ease the burden of red tape on our business owners, big and small. If we keep passing complex legislation that is rushed and not properly consulted on, we are making it harder for businesses and entrepreneurs to succeed in Australia. We need to get back to basics, with draft exposures of legislation for consultation and genuine engagement with a variety of stakeholders—listening to feedback and incorporating it to make our laws better. If we don't, we will continue to waste the time of this House on legislative clean-ups. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. While I think many constituents in Wentworth are open to the right to disconnect, there is some concern that it's come out of nowhere and hasn't been subject to the usual processes and scrutiny associated with significant changes in IR law, as the member for Warringah illustrated so carefully in her speech. As we consider this legislation, I wonder if the minister might be willing to share who was involved with consultation on the right to disconnect. I want to thank the member for Wentworth and also acknowledge that I was here for the speech given by the member for Warringah as well. I acknowledge that there are many issues we agree on within my Arts portfolio, but we are regularly in disagreement with Workplace Relations. There are often different views, but the engagement has always been constructive and, certainly, in the interest of their electorates. The right to disconnect had first been proposed through two parliamentary inquiries. For the work and care Senate inquiry, in terms of their consultation, not everybody would have made submissions on the right to disconnect but there were 125 submissions. It then came up again in the inquiry into the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023, where there were 130 submissions; obviously there only would have been a small number that dealt directly with closing loopholes, although I understand it came up directly during some of the evidence taken in the hearings that they held. Those were the formal parliamentary processes that caused some crossbench members, notably the Greens Party, to make clear last year that their support for the bill would ultimately be contingent on a right to disconnect being legislated. They made that clear publicly. At that point, we as a party adopted it as policy but as a government had not yet declared it at that point. Because it was coming up as a crossbench amendment, I made a point of making some comments about it publicly. Then there was a meeting on 2 February with employer groups, and that meeting has been made public. Not all of the employer groups but some of them had disengaged for some months from direct contact, which I respect—it's their right to do so. They did so very publicly. On 2 February, that was the moment they started to re-engage again. We worked through a lot of issues in the meeting; the right to disconnect was one of them. It would be disingenuous for me to claim that there was a whole meeting about it, but it was certainly an issue that was raised at that meeting with the business groups. There were conversations back and forth with a number of the groups that were present at that meeting. At that meeting we had ACCI, the BCA, AIG, the Minerals Council of Australia, the Master Builders Association, COSBOA, the Australian Retailers Association and the RCSA there—a series of groups. Subsequent to that, some of them, not all of them, had direct conversations back and forth with my office about different issues of concern they had with a series of aspects of the bill. One of those was the right to disconnect. Ultimately, the consultation continued between the government, the Greens Party and Senator David Pocock. I'm not sure of the extent to which Senator Jacqui Lambie was involved at that point, but ultimately we ended up at a point where, across Senator David Pocock, the Greens Party and the government, there was a form of words on which all could agree. There was consultation happening with business in terms of what they viewed as the worst possible ways to legislate if you were going to. I don't want to pretend the business groups were asking for this to be legislated at all, but, in terms of the views that the business groups put about if this were to be done and how they believed it would be more workable than other options, that consultation was certainly very much reflected in the amendment that ultimately went through. I thank the minister for his response. I note that the COIL, the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which typically provides advice to government on IR changes, was not consulted in this instance. Could the minister clarify for the record whether COIL was consulted and, if not, why not. Because my portfolio—I was even guilty of it then, when I listed out the business groups—collapses into a world of acronyms very quickly, I will explain the concept of what the COIL is. Under the Fair Work Act, there is a national workplace relations committee. It involves equal numbers of employer groups and union representatives. It has existed for a long time, regardless of who the minister of the day has been from each side of politics. It has a subcommittee known as the Committee on Industrial Legislation, referred to as COIL. What happens at that meeting is that, when government legislation is introduced, before it becomes public, it goes to that committee on a completely confidential basis. To my knowledge, that trust, no matter what people think of the legislation, hasn't been broken. What then happens is that you'll get people—under the other side of politics, it's more likely to be the unions; under this government, most recently, you'll get it from some of the business groups—who will say, 'Okay, first of all, I don't want you to do this at all. If you were to, these are the legislative problems with how you're dealing with it.' That's what COIL is and how it works. That's possible for government legislation. When we are dealing with an amendment that is coming from the crossbench in either house, whether it be the Senate or the House of Representatives, the government cannot present, with any certainty, what is going to be considered in the parliament, because it is the right of the crossbench member to choose their own amendment. That's the reason why the Committee on Industrial Legislation doesn't get consulted on crossbench amendments, nor can it be consulted on crossbench amendments. It is simply because it is the right of the crossbench to move the amendments in whatever form they choose. I thank the minister for his response. I take the point that COIL is typically consulted on government legislation and that the initial legislation implementing the right to disconnect is not government legislation. However, the right was supported by government, presumably after quite a lot of negotiation and internal consideration, and is now law. My question is: would the minister be willing to commit to consulting COIL on significant changes to IR legislation in the future, even for non-government amendments, which are likely to receive government support and become law? I'm really grateful to the member for Wentworth for both raising it and the terms on which it's raised. I don't think it is possible to have a workable way of presenting an amendment to a formal meeting of COIL that we ultimately don't have carriage of. Amendments in the Senate, similar to when amendments have gone back and forth in the House sometimes—which happened a bit on the secure jobs, better pay bill and has happened probably in a more specific way with climate legislation in the House—continue to be varied up until quite close to the time, in which case what was presented to the COIL by the government effectively might not reflect what ends up being introduced. I am certainly very open to working out what formal processes we can have to make sure that we get the benefit of a similar process. There's no doubt—and anyone who has held my job from either side of politics over the years will tell you—that the time lines of COIL are really frustrating and the outcomes are always helpful. That's something that will always be said. If there is a way of getting that sort of benefit for crossbench amendments, I'm interested in seeing how that might be able to be done. I don't think a direct replication of how it works for government can be done without taking away the effective rights of crossbench members and their agency over their own amendments. But I'm happy to, at the next meeting of the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council, raise the issue of the sorts of processes, even if they're conceptual, and where we can get the benefit of some of those processes, where an amendment is likely to be moved. It would, of course, have to be done in a way where it was really clear that it was still the right of the crossbench, that they might do something different—in which case the government would have to make a call—and that it couldn't be seen as a breach of trust. If we presented something radically different to the parliament to what we presented to COIL, it would be seen as a breach of trust unless the differences were what had been raised at COIL. So, if we can find a way of doing that, of getting some benefit from that sort of process, then I'm certainly open to it, and I'm happy to give the member for Wentworth an undertaking that I will take that up and explore how it might be possible to deal with the principles or policies that we think are likely to come through from crossbench amendments. Question agreed to. Bill agreed to. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.","Fair Work Amendment Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(16:58):"
"0","0","0","1","2","0","471","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I'd like to take this grievance debate literally and grieve for all those innocent lives lost in the horrific war between Hamas and the Israeli government, now in its fifth month. Yes, conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is decades old, but this latest violence is devastating. The day of 7 October 2023 saw the largest loss of Jewish life on a single day since World War II, at the hands of terrorist group Hamas, who still holds civilian hostages. The harrowing situation in the occupied Palestinian territories is affecting many Australians, who are grieving and scared for family and loved ones.  Australia has vocally and repeatedly expressed concern about the unacceptable loss of civilian lives in Gaza. Worryingly, though, it may get worse. This week, according to media reports, the Israeli government may tick off on plans for a ground offensive, a major ground offensive, in Rafah, where over one million Palestinians are sheltering in tents and clinging to life. The Prime Minister is absolutely right to call on Israel not to go down this path. I've been a longstanding and vocal supporter of Palestinian rights and the need for a just resolution to this conflict and a political agreement for two states—a secure Israel and a Palestinian state—the longstanding policy of Australia and many nations. Yes, a secure Israel. The world cannot just abandon the Jewish people to be slaughtered by the Iranian regime or their proxy extremists. Those calling for extreme responses should remember this. The world also cannot stand by while Gazans starve to death or just passively observe accelerating dispossession and escalating violence in the West Bank. Mass starvation is not a proportionate response to Hamas's horror show. All human life is sacred, and all innocent civilians should be protected. Domestically, one of the most offensive things said is that the Australian government or parliament or MPs support genocide. That is ridiculous. Everyone wants to see a ceasefire. Australia has voted for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and of course wants to see a permanent ceasefire agreed to urgently by both parties. Australia has also stated that we expect Israel to abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice in South Africa's case alleging genocide. Most urgently though, right now, is the need to get food to the people starving in Gaza. I say to the government of Israel: for God's sake, let food in now—not tomorrow or next week or next month but now, today. Right now, 400,000 Gazans are starving. Now, one million are at risk of starvation. Families in Gaza have been forced to forage for scraps of food left by rats and eat leaves out of desperation to survive. A Save the Children aid worker said: My husband told me people have resorted to eating bird and animal food and tree leaves out of desperation. He has been forced to scavenge for scraps of food; he recently found scraps in his sister's house that had already been ruined by rats but washed them and ate them anyway because there is literally nothing else left to eat. He said he will not perish from bombs, but from scarcity of food. The UN has said that, in the first six weeks of this year, from 1 January, over 50 per cent of aid missions to areas north of Wadi Gaza, where the starvation is highest, were denied by Israeli forces. Australia has committed $46½ million in aid since this violence started, but the truth is that right now only Israel has the power to decide if the people of Gaza will die of starvation or not—not Hamas, not Australia, not Egypt and not even the US; it is Israel that can decide this. If the right-wing Israeli government wants to salvage the shreds that are left of its international reputation with much of the world, it should let enough food in now. How can a country that has so many wonderful people and so much to offer the world, which claims to be a civilised democratic state, fail to act with urgency while civilians are at immediate risk of starving to death 10 kilometres from their shops and supermarkets? Of course, one of the many big lies being spread in Australia is that the government has cut all funding to UNRWA. That is untrue. In fact, the Labor government restored funding to UNRWA that the Liberals cut, and then we doubled it. All $20.6 million has been paid this financial year. Six million dollars in extra funding has been temporarily paused, not cut, and of course people want that resolved and restored. Looking ahead, the world must maintain focus on the creation of two secure states. The current Israeli Prime Minister's repeated declarations that he will not support the creation of a Palestinian state demand an urgent international response. The grave implication is that his extreme right-wing government is hell-bent on formalising a policy of apartheid. If not forced relocation, then what else can he possibly mean? Former Israeli prime ministers have observed that if there is no Palestinian state, there can only be a single, non-Jewish majority state—and that's off the table—or a non-democratic apartheid state. Formal recognition of a Palestinian state should form part of the world's response, along with urgent action to curb and reverse illegal Israeli settlements and extremist settler violence in the West Bank. Frankly, there is little point to people in the world, me included, rabbiting on about a two-state solution if Israel keeps settling the West Bank without consequence, making a Palestinian state impossible. Given Mr Netanyahu's comments, words now need to be matched with action by the international community to impose consequences on the illegal settlements enterprise. Australia must make sure that our nation and its citizens are not active or passive participants in the settlement enterprise. The USA, the UK and likely the EU are moving to entry-visa bans for extremist settlers. Australia's not at the top of their travel destination list, but other consequences should be considered in concert with other nations. Financial sanctions against the terrorist group Hamas are welcome. Consistency is important, and terrorist-like activities by extremist settlers also demand determined responses. Internationally consistent financial sanctions on individuals and entities directly linked to settler violence and Palestinian dispossession, including construction, finance and agricultural companies should be developed. The urgent clarification should be made that the 2019 Australia-Israel convention on double taxation only applies to land within the 1967 borders, as the agreement lacks an explicit territoriality clause that equivalent EU and US agreements have. Why isn't it illegal for Australians to donate to support illegal settlement activity in the West Bank, and why on earth should people be able to get a tax deduction for doing so? The Jewish National Fund's Israeli wing was revealed to be purchasing Palestinian properties for illegal settlements in the occupied territories. There are concerning reports that the Australian JNF is raising money for Ateret Cohanim, who have been working to get rid of Palestinian residents in Jerusalem. Human rights organisations recognise it as a terrorist group. The Christians for Israel foundation are openly funnelling money into illegal settlements. The seminary for advancement of Jerusalem and the Ariel University Australia trust are supporting a university in the occupied territories. None of these connections are hidden. These organisations openly solicit donations and support settler and settlement related activities. I will continue to pursue these issues and will write formally to the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, raising questions and seeking information about these charities. Thank you to the many Australians and the Israeli progressive Jewish and human rights groups who have contacted me since I first raised these issues. To speak up about these things is not anti-Semitic, and it's not anti-Israel. Anti-Semitism is a curse, and to label legitimate criticism of the current extremist right-wing Israeli government as anti-Semitism distracts focus from combating genuine prejudice and discrimination in our community. The views I've expressed are openly discussed in Israel, and to be called anti-Semitic when you raise them here is nonsense. Gross politicisation of this tragedy by the Leader of the Opposition and the Greens political party is despicable. In the last few months, Australians have seen very clearly what the Liberals and Greens are up to. The Liberals are trying to harvest votes from the Jewish community and the Greens from the Australian Muslim community, with extreme rhetoric, hyperbole and blatant untruths. Mythbusters: Australia is not cutting all funding from UNRWA; Australia is not selling weapons to Israel; Australia does not support genocide; Australia does want to see a ceasefire; and Australia is not giving terrorists visas to come here. Only the Labor Party has any interest whatsoever in maintaining social cohesion in Australia and contributing constructively internationally on this issue. All MPs and community leaders should be guided by the same principle of a just and enduring peace, and a negotiated two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist in peace and security within internationally recognised borders—and committed to maintaining that commitment to a peaceful Australian community.","Middle East","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(17:21):"
"0","0","0","1","2","0","473","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I rise to speak in this grievance debate and, firstly, I want to discuss the impact of natural disasters on our children. This morning I was fortunate enough to host an event for Royal Far West and UNICEF Australia to discuss this very issue. We were lucky to have a range of experts, even those personally impacted by the Black Summer bushfires, including Scott and his son Ed, who came down for it. I'd like to thank them very much for what they told us of the experience for them personally—particularly how Royal Far West was able to help Ed deal with the impact of the bushfires, his attendance at school and the mental health impact and toll it has taken on the family as a whole.  I'm lucky enough to have Royal Far West in my electorate. It's coming up to its centenary celebration. It has been operating for nearly 100 years, assisting country kids. It's a local organisation with a national reach, delivering support for our regional communities and improving the health and wellbeing of our nation's rural and remote children by connecting kids to the care they need. And, yes, it has always been based in Manly. What has been amazing, with the advent of new technology, has been the use of telehealth and the provision of wraparound services for country kids. Unfortunately, they can't access these in some of the more remote areas. We know that Australia is already facing more extreme weather due to climate change, and communities around Australia have already suffered the devastating impacts of bushfires and floods. Too rarely when we discuss those events do we consider how these events are so traumatic—the traumatic impact they have on our children and how they experience it. This is particularly in relation to their emotional and mental health. One of the most stark figures from our recent natural disasters that really stood out to me was that, according to a just-released UNICEF report by Deloitte, 1.4 million children and young people in Australia have experienced a disaster in an average year. And children and young people are more likely to experience disasters if they're in regional or remote areas, from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and/or from First Nations communities. The cost of the impact of the emotional and mental health trauma is staggering. Children and young people are, as a result of those disasters, 4.2 per cent less likely to finish their schooling to year 12. This means that the cost to productivity later in life, and to their own personal lost earnings, is some $3 million. Those children impacted are also between 1.3 and 4.5 per cent more likely to experience psychological distress, leading to $162 million in healthcare cost increases. To build resilient communities, we need to consider the youngest community members and their needs, recognise the impacts that climate change is having on their childhoods and build resilience to climate change. Too often, from spring to autumn, we see various communities on the news that are at risk of or impacted by bushfire threats, and we'll get the news that the school is closed. How often do newsreaders—or does anyone—pause to reflect on what that means for that community? The school being closed means that children are left at home, sometimes unattended, sometimes at risk. It means that productivity stops because parents stay home as well. The impact to the children's educational journey and their failure then to meet milestones is considerable. The UNICEF and Deloitte report had several key insights worth sharing that we need to take up with urgency. They include a nationally consistent approach to supporting children and young people in their preparation and response to disasters, and a risk informed approach to disaster recovery and resilience building for children and young people, because the impacts don't happen, as one might expect, straight after a disaster. The report found that, for children, the stress and mental and psychological impacts from disasters come to light on average about 18 months after a disaster. So when we have a government focused on delivering disaster relief within a two-year window after a disaster and expecting everything to be fixed, it shows how that model is inadequate for what happens on the ground. Disaster recovery and resilience building funding should also be sensitive to the unique needs of children and young people. We must prioritise addressing those gaps and key services for children, investing in the initiatives that work and addressing the need for sustainable future funding to care for children impacted by climate change. To that end, I have submitted to the government that they need to continue to fund organisations like Royal Far West for the very essential work that they are doing to support children around the country. Their work requires some $15.8 million in federal funding over the forward estimates. To date they've helped some 3,000 children from 60 schools, preschools and kindergartens in New South Wales and Queensland since the introduction of the community recovery service that commenced in 2020 in response to the Black Summer bushfires. It's clear that the assistance that those programs are delivering is incredibly important—and we heard that incredible testimony this morning. Another issue that I'd like to raise in the grievance debate is the News Limited announcement that Beetaloo is now a proven gas powerhouse. What we should be announcing is that it is a proven emissions and climate bomb. Even before yesterday's announcement, the project has been reported to be causing greenhouse gas emissions that will be the equivalent of 20 per cent of Australia's total emissions inventory. That's right; 20 per cent of our nation's emissions will be coming from one project. It's monstrous. Yesterday Tamboran announced to the ASX that its preliminary drilling results indicated that there was more gas, that there were faster flow rates and that reserves were higher than expected—even more emissions in the midst of a climate crisis. This announcement came with bullish rhetoric about expansion and how the project is close to the financial closure of the initial wells, with plans for many more. The claims that the project will meet the projected gas shortfalls for the east coast market were unsurprisingly not met with any challenge in the media or any testing as to their veracity. In fact, when Tamboran said that they were the one and only solution to address shortfall that is projected on the east coast—there's just so much that is misleading and problematic about those claims. Firstly, the latest ACCC gas inquiry states that there will be no expected shortfalls until 2028 and that this may change depending on gas demand and the rapid transition to renewable energy. Even in the event of a shortfall, this project is not the 'one and only solution', as unfortunately we have a list of multiple new gas fields being approved by the government, which, like Beetaloo, are all identifying that they will somehow supply the shortfall. Tamboran has also not identified a pipeline or a way in which they will deliver such gas to the east coast, because the inference is there that what will in fact happen is yet more gas for export, for sale internationally, and of course record profits and very little revenue back to the Australian people through the government's proposed PRRT legislation. Further, there are grave concerns about this project's expansion—that it should be subject to approvals, including one that is currently pending, before there is commercialisation. It is reliant on the approvals and the building of a pipeline. Also, in relation to yesterday's announcement, the proposal is still pending approval from the Northern Territory government, and yet a Northern Territory minister is continuing to publicly support the expansion of this project before it has even been approved, giving rise to concerns of bias and undermining any kind of approval process. But, even in this place, yesterday's announcement brings up a more serious issue, which is that this project has still not been referred to the minister for the environment under the EPBC Act, and, despite the gravity of this proposal and its potential environmental impacts, it hasn't yet come under federal scrutiny. Last year the EPBC Act was amended to include a water trigger—an amendment that was recommended by the scientific Pepper inquiry into the Beetaloo basin. This is incredibly important, because it looked at the impacts of the projects and the risks to the water table. Overwhelmingly the key concern in the community, for farmers, locals, vets and First Nations leaders, was 'the potential impact of any onshore shale gas industry on water resources'. When there is that risk of contamination, a key concern in relation to the Northern Territory and their water from this basin, why has this project not yet come before the minister for the environment for consideration under the EPBC Act? When we talk about the impact of climate on children and there is this reckless behaviour, there is a strong disconnect.","Natural Disasters, Gas Industry","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(17:30):"

My first stop was the Bridport Men's Shed, were I met with Terry, Jack, Mick, George, Don and Gail to have a cuppa, a catch up and a delicious slice of coffee cake made by Terry's wife. Whilst the morning tea was lovely, the real purpose of the visit was to take a look at their latest drill press and bandsaw, purchased for $5,000 and funded through the Stronger Communities Program.  Situated in a rural coastal town, the Bridport Men's Shed first opened in 2015, and was driven by several community members, including George who I met last week, who also saw a need for a place where locals could keep their bodies and their minds active at little or no cost. What rang true in meeting with some of the members last week was how important the place is for social connection, particularly for those who may struggle after losing a loved one. They pointed out the significance of the $5,000 for the community shed. Whilst it may not seem like a lot of money to many, the organisation recognises it would've been extremely difficult for them to fundraise the money needed to buy essential new equipment. This was exactly the goal of the Stronger Communities Program when it was first developed by the coalition government. It aimed to deliver social benefits in communities across Australia, providing grants between $2,500 and $20,000 to community organisations and local governments for small-scale projects. The program has helped fund over 15,000 such projects across Australia, across every single electorate, including in my electorate of Bass, where more than 70 projects have been supported. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the independent selection committee made up of members of Tasmania's upper house whose electorates cover the whole of Bass. To MLCs Rosemary Armitage, Jo Palmer, Tania Rattray and Nick Duigan: thank you for being fierce advocates for your regions. As I highlight a number of these worthy projects in my speech this evening, I want the Labor government to sit up and take notice. These are the types of community organisations you risk leaving behind if you fail to commit to further Stronger Communities Program funding—projects like the community garden in Scottsdale, headed up by the Better Health 4 Dorset team and part of Health Consumers Tasmania, who were a worthy recipient of $10,000 in funding from the last round of the Stronger Communities Program. I left the Bridport Men's Shed to head to the official opening of the garden last week. The garden is one of the first health and wellbeing initiatives established by the Better Health 4 Dorset team—formed by a group of around 20 locals who were working on several key issues, including local transport, mental health, improving access to health care and establishing a health and wellbeing hub. The idea of the community garden was ignited by the community themselves. The better health team facilitated over 20 kitchen-conversation sessions involving more than 100 locals, who identified that a community garden was an important and missing piece of infrastructure in the area. After securing funding through the Stronger Communities Program, more than 40 community members worked tirelessly on the project for many months, culminating in the official opening last week. It will be available to schools, the elderly and the community at large. Bec Smith from Health Consumers Tasmania said the aim of the garden is: … to promote healthy eating, improve access to fresh, affordable produce and improve mental health by providing avenues for locals to connect and work together. It's amazing what $10,000 can do. Ten thousand dollars can also purchase much-needed storage for an organisation like Dorset Community House. Located in the heart of Scottsdale, Dorset Community House provides several critical services and activities, not just in Scottsdale but right through to Gladstone, Bridport, Golconda and Alberton, covering more than 3,000 square kilometres. From community transport to school holiday programs, financial counselling, baby playtime and playgroup, the organisation needs to maximise and utilise the space it has. With as much funding as possible diverted to essential programs, it's often the smaller but necessary infrastructure projects that fall by the wayside. Funding from programs like the Stronger Communities Program can help fill that gap. These are just three examples of north-east Tasmanian organisations that have benefited from the last round of the Stronger Communities Program, but there are so many others to share. When you think about the number of volunteers and volunteer hours that go into keeping these organisations going, in a time when keeping volunteers on board is an increasing issue, ripping away essential funding will also make things more difficult. In 2019, the value of volunteering in Tasmania was estimated to be around $4 billion, with volunteers contributing an average of 229 hours a year, amounting to around 4.4 hours each week. In fact, volunteering is Tasmania's biggest sector, larger than both the private and public sectors. As elected representatives, we know that governments rely on volunteers to fill the many gaps that the government can't or won't. For members of the Launceston & North East Railway organisation, funding from the Stronger Communities Program has meant they were finally able to build a shed and workshop to house their rail bugs. Over the past seven years, volunteers from the organisation have worked to preserve the railway history of the region, and, with tourism plans in the works, volunteer member Greg Stewart took on the task of designing and building rail bugs at the organisation's Turners Marsh location. The three bugs, painted red, blue and green, will eventually be used for tourists to travel along more than three kilometres of the currently disused rail line between Turners Marsh and Waddles Road in Karoola. Each bug has disc brakes and four seats—two at the front for peddlers and two at the back for passengers—and each has the ability to reach a top speed of 20 kilometres per hour. Mr Stewart said the shed would not have been possible without the support of the grant. 'We have a 100 per cent volunteer workforce, doing it all in our own time, at our own expense, and the only money we earn at the moment is from barbecues, raffles and a grant like this one,' he said. In Launceston, a $14,000 Stronger Communities Program grant provided the opportunity for the local tramway museum to purchase solar panels for their Inveresk building. Wholly run by a team of dedicated volunteers, the Launceston Tramway Museum is a community based organisation working to restore and revive old trams that once roamed the city. Andrew MacKenzie, president of the Launceston Tramway Museum Society, said the grant has made a significant impact on the sustainability of the organisation by reducing operational costs. 'Installing solar panels allows for the fiscally feasible operation of the tram by drawing on power generated by the solar panels,' he said. Through the Stronger Communities Program, City Park Radio, which runs on the dedication of a passionate team of volunteers, was able to purchase essential podcasting equipment, providing an opportunity for anybody in our northern Tasmanian region to tell a story or learn a new technical skill. The grant program is also responsible for assisting with the set-up of Launceston's first tool library, providing a benefit to members of our local community who may not have the space or money to buy their own tools. On remote Flinders Island, the Furneaux Islands Community Shed has been able to purchase a new Lucas Mill to benefit its 60-plus members, thanks to the Stronger Communities Program. For Girl Guides Tasmania, it has provided a kitchen upgrade at their local camp site in my electorate. In Beauty Point, it provided funds to renovate an underused church hall to create and grow a community club. The grant has provided funds to purchase gardening equipment, assisting Community Gardens Australia to grow a community garden, benefiting students from Ravenswood Heights Primary School and the local community. Karinya young women's shelter has been providing safe, confidential crisis accommodation for more than 40 years, and they were able to upgrade their IT services to ensure the organisation can continue its community outreach services. The Elders Council of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Corporation have finally been able to upgrade their driveway to ensure the safety of members and visitors. This project has been on their wish list for several years, and I know they were thrilled to receive funding through the Stronger Communities Program. The Stronger Communities Program has provided funds to improve a sensory space, assisting in setting up a therapeutic multisensory room for clients with disability. It's helped keep our community safe by assisting Tamar Sea Rescue to purchase a rescue vessel. The program provided the West Launceston Bowls and Community Club funds to continue their successful school bowls program by providing funding for equipment. The Lapidary Club, the Northern Tasmanian Netball Association and the Launceston Musical Society were all able to purchase equipment to ensure the sustainability and growth of their organisations. The organisations I've listed tonight are just a few of the countless community organisations in Northern Tasmania that have benefited from Stronger Communities, and there are many more who would benefit from the funding this program provides. At a time when the cost of living is at an all-time high and it's becoming harder and harder to meet growing costs, keep volunteers and fundraise, the federal government cannot turn its backs on our communities in need. I urgently call on the government to commit to continuing the program in the upcoming budget.","Stronger Communities Program","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(17:40):"

They assist government in developing and delivering on policy agendas and priorities, and the APS, the Australian Public Service, is, of course, a really trusted institution in Australia. The daily workload is phenomenal at times, and the work of public servants continues to both astonish and frustrate communities at different times, sometimes in equal measure.

Wait times at Services Australia have been getting progressively worse for a number of years now, and the root cause of the issue is a conflation of a shocking reduction in staff numbers, as well as a reliance on IT systems that, under the former government—I think we would have to be frank—just simply did not work. Since Labor was last in government, more than a decade ago, the staffing levels at Services Australia have declined, and this enabled shocking schemes like robodebt to really get away from the former government. Currently, Services Australia gets over one million calls a week. There are 10 million visits into Centrelink offices each year and there are 1.1 billion transactions taking place online. This is a very, very big service delivery. We know that the increasing call wait times and processing delays at Services Australia have caused distress and absolute inconvenience. I see that in my constituents and in those receiving various government payments and income support. We also know there is no substitute in human services for real humans. We have provided an extra $228 million to increase the agency's frontline staffing and operations. We've rapidly recruited 3,000 frontline staff, bringing 500 new staff into Medicare and 2,500 staff into Centrelink to provide support with these issues around processing and telephony. We started recruiting those extra people in November and December of last year, and they are now in place. These new staff are currently being trained to allow them to effectively help people when they are calling in. Many have completed their initial training and have started on the phones, and we are starting to see some positive results on the number of calls answered and the average wait times. As more people complete initial training and move onto the phones, we'll see those numbers improve and improve. We've also bolstered the number of interpreters to help the agency engage with culturally and linguistically diverse communities. On top of that, we have put an extra 850 people on just to deal with the natural disasters payment, an issue that affects so many of us in different parts of Australia. The priority is to really blitz that payment backlog. In the current climate, where the cost of living is a factor for many Australians, the agency is working hard to expedite customer outcomes, as it should, and that is the focus for the government. I know that Novocastrians are also feeling frustrated and stressed by the long processing times within the NDIA. When disability service providers are facing delays when they're trying to register as NDIS providers or waiting for claims to get paid, we know that it's the participants who really feel that, and it means that they're not accessing the services they need when they need them and instead are stuck in limbo, waiting for support. That is not a situation we want to see ever continue. The NDIS has delivered what is absolutely a better deal for hundreds of thousands of Australians. I see this in my community every day. We were one of the trial sites. Ten thousand people went onto the NDIS as soon as the rollout began. It made phenomenal changes in people's daily lives and quality of life. But we want to do more to achieve that vision of NDIS, so the government, alongside the National Cabinet, has committed to reforming the NDIS to make sure that the disability supports are fairer for all Australians. We know an effective NDIS will improve outcomes for people with disability, help them achieve their life goals and ensure the sustainability of the scheme for future generations. The independent NDIS review received almost 4,000 submissions and engaged with thousands of people. An overarching goal of the review was to put people with disability back at the centre of the NDIS and to help restore trust, confidence and pride in the NDIS. I want to thank those who took part in this process and who shared their story in order to help shape a better system. The review was released on 7 December, last year, and included 26 recommendations and 139 supporting actions. The review panel engaged deeply with Australians with disability, carers and the disability sector, as well as the states and territories and other relevant experts, and it will inform how state, federal and territory governments should work together to reform the NDIS. This is a significant moment in Australian history, particularly for people with disability and their families and the disability sector. With Labor in government, we can bring down NDIS costs and improve the experience and outcomes of participants at the same time. It's not an either-or choice for us. I know this is something that the minister is incredibly passionate about, and we'll fight tooth and nail to ensure that we have a system that meets the needs of those it is intended for. Finally, I just want to update the House on the Albanese Labor government's commitment to ensuring that the veteran community is provided with the best possible services and support. With increasing costs of living and rising costs for business, the veteran community have told us that they're finding it harder and harder to find GPs who will treat them without accumulating out-of-pocket expenses. From 1 November, the Labor government tripled the veterans' access payment in an effort to encourage more GPs to service veterans. The veterans' access payment is an incentive that GPs receive, in addition to the Medicare rebate, when treating veterans who hold a DVA gold card or a white card. The tripling of this payment will ensure that GPs continue to service our veterans, with no out-of-pocket costs. Payments apply to general face-to-face and telehealth GP consultations, including home visits for people who are homebound and consultations in residential aged-care facilities. We've also streamlined and reduced the paperwork for GPs; the first package of the 19 most-frequently used forms has now been consolidated down to just seven, while a process is underway to significantly reduce the remaining 54 forms by the middle of this year. We're working through the big backlog that we inherited, and there is some very good news on that front. As of 31 January this year, the total number of claims yet to be allocated to a delegate at DVA had fallen to 3,697. That's still way too many but down from that shocking number we inherited. I want to encourage Novocastrians to keep reaching out to my office. Governments are providing good services; we want to make sure they're the very best they can be, and we're always here for continuous improvement. Imagine looking into the eyes of the Australian people who elected you as their nation's leader and repeatedly being untruthful—deliberately telling untruths. That is exactly what Anthony Albanese and this Labor government continue to do to Australians. They have built a government based on lies and broken promises, with a weak leadership team at the helm. Remember the $275 lower electricity price promise? What about cheaper mortgages? That also was a promise before the election. Do we remember the phrase, 'Life will be cheaper under me,' on the front page of the newspaper? The now Prime Minister continued to spout that during the last election campaign. And it turns out that we were right all along, because it won't be easy under Albanese—and it hasn't been easy. Added to the list of broken promises is of course his monumental tax-cut backflip, which unfolded earlier this month. And now Australians are set to foot the bill for Labor's broken stage 3 tax cuts promise. After spending $450 million dollars—that's almost half a billion dollars—on a failed referendum and adding $209 billion in extra spending across the economy, the government will now spend $40 million on an advertising campaign to sell their tax cuts. At the same time, they're giving just $14 million to struggling food banks. That tells you what they're doing and what their priorities are under the Albanese Labor government. That's a whopping $55,000 of taxpayer money per day on an advertising campaign to sell their tax cuts. It's an eye-watering amount of money to spend on a public information campaign for a single measure—in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis—and I think that Australians will make up their own minds on that. They'll decide—in fact, they'll decide this weekend in the electorate of Dunkley—whether they want to send the Prime Minister a message on what his priorities are at the moment and what they've been since Labor came to power. They know they can't buy integrity for $15 a week. The government know that, so they're looking to spend $40 million trying to convince people of their lie instead. But no amount of money is going to justify that calculated lie, and Australians are feeling poorer under this Labor government. Why are they feeling poorer? Because they are poorer! Australians are poorer after 18 months under this government. Personal income tax has risen by a record 27 per cent and living standards have collapsed by 8.6 per cent. That's a big difference. Labor's broken promises are piling up and taking more money out of the pockets of hardworking Australians. We know that: we speak to family and friends who are struggling. Parts of my community are struggling. The stats are clear: Australians are set to pay an extra $28 billion more in taxes over the next 10 years because of this decision to change the rollout of the stage 3 tax cuts, mainly through bracket creep. Does a promise mean anything to this government? Anthony Albanese said, 'My word is my bond,' but it's blatantly clear that his word means nothing— The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Ms Vamvakinou ): I'll just interrupt and remind the member for Moncrieff to refer to members by their correct titles. Ms BELL: Thank you for that very gentle reminder, Deputy Speaker! The Prime Minister said, 'My word is my bond,' but it's blatantly clear in the wake of these broken promises that his word means nothing. The string of broken promises from this Prime Minister is eclipsed only by the outright assault on the values that Australians hold so dear. My electorate is in the heart of the Gold Coast. We certainly consider it to be the home, the natural home, of the entrepreneurial spirit, with more than 70,000 registered businesses across the Gold Coast and 32,000 in my electorate alone. But our aspiration and hard work is under attack through the wealth redistribution strategy coming from the most socialist government since Whitlam. So beware, Australians; beware, Gold Coasters, of what is next. Negative gearing and capital gains tax on the family home could be up for grabs; who knows? Remember 'my word is my bond'? That is what we heard, but we have seen those words being changed, haven't we? We have seen 'my word is my bond' up in lights. We have seen 'life will be easier' or 'life will be cheaper' up in lights. But that is not the reality today. Treasury secretary Dr Kennedy refused to rule out work being done within Treasury on further tax changes that would amount to more broken promises. Dr Kennedy suggested he was unable to pick the specifics of what they're working on in the tax system, stating 'particularly if they should be near a cabinet process or they are part of a deliberative process'. So there you have it. In Labor's first 18 months, the mountain of broken promises piling up is pushing the struggling families across our nation further into crisis with the cost of living. I have even heard about people going to the supermarket and buying their groceries on their credit card. That is a terrible position to be if you are running a family. It is clear that, when Labor run out of money, they come after yours and they certainly come after ours. They have continued to lie and mislead the Australian public and, given their track record, will continue to do so. The Albanese government continue to spiral out of control when it comes to their broken promises and their weak leadership. The weak leadership runs deep within this government. In what can only be described as an embarrassing display, the immigration minister continues to duck and weave from scrutiny over the mishandling of his responsibilities. But, in true Labor fashion, those opposite continue to point fingers and play the blame game by attacking and undermining the previous government for Labor's lies and broken promises. Labor are claiming they're the ones cleaning up the coalition's mess, but these criminal detainees, 37 of whom are sex offenders, were released on Labor's watch. Some 149 hardened criminals have been released into our communities across the country on Labor's watch. Clearly, they weren't interested in watching too closely, because ,while Minister Giles's department was briefing his office on legal options in advance of the NZYQ case, he was busy advocating at Voice rallies in Canberra, where these briefings took place. This is a shocking failure on community safety and national security from this government. The fact that the Prime Minister was apparently not even aware of the first illegal boat arrival when he was asked at a press conference shows this government has completely lost control and interest in Australia's border security. The Prime Minister's weak leadership on national security is clearly incentivising the people smugglers to reopen their operations. The results of the coalition's tough border policy, Operation Sovereign Borders, speak for themselves. I note the former home affairs minister is here in the Federation Chamber and I congratulate her on the work that she did in that portfolio to keep our borders safe. I reflect on the fact that we broke the back of the people-smuggling trade that originally brought chaos to our borders on Labor's watch—under the Gillard and Rudd governments. It is clear this government is spiralling out of control. They cannot even keep our community safe. We do not know where those hardened criminals are. We don't know where the sex offenders are or where those murderers are that this government has let out into our communities across our nation. Australians should be very concerned about this. Australia should also be concerned about the boats that are now coming to our shores. Think back to before Tony Abbott became the Prime Minister and stopped the boats. Operation Sovereign Borders, under the former prime minister Scott Morrison as immigration minister, was where we had good results. But now people smugglers on the other side of the world are getting the message that they can come here to our country. They're getting that message because there have been some illegal boat arrivals. That's a terrible message to send across the world to those awful people smugglers, who are always watching. It should come as no surprise that those illegal arrivals came after Labor ripped $600 million from border security in their most recent budget, a decision which, according to the Australian Border Force Commissioner, would leave his frontline forces 'stretched'. As a result, the Department of Home Affairs admits maritime surveillance has decreased due to workforce and asset shortages, and that directly resulted in a return to the human tragedy we saw during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, a dark time when there were 50,000 illegal boat arrivals on 820 boats and, tragically, there were at least 1,200 deaths at sea. The Prime Minister was central to that period in government. As Prime Minister, he can't even look the Australian people in the eye and say that Operation Sovereign Borders is operating as it did under the coalition government. Labor will do anything to try and pull the wool over the eyes of Australians, but their complaining does not mask their policy failures. Can we trust this Prime Minister when all he and his ministers have done is lie, deceive the public and underdeliver on national security? The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I thank the member. Before I call the member for Holt, I will bring standing order No. 90, reflections on members, to the attention of everybody in the chamber: All imputations of improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly. That includes calling other members liars.","Albanese Government","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle—Deputy Speaker) ","(17:50):"

"0","0","0","1","2","0","483","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","As we approach International Women's Day, I rise to shed light on the pivotal steps taken by the Albanese Labor government in advancing women's economic empowerment. Since forming government in 2022, the Australian Labor Party has embedded women's economic equality as a core ideal for our nation.  Today we have seen the publication of individual companies' gender pay gaps by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. This signals a momentous shift in Australia's approach to measuring gender parity in the workforce. For too long gender pay gaps have lurked in the shadows. They have perpetuated systemic injustice that upset the full participation and advancement of women. But with a stroke of the legislative pen in March 2023 by the Minister for Women, Katy Gallagher, we are seeing a new era of transparency—one that holds employers accountable for the conditions within their workplaces. The public naming and shaming of companies with significant gender pay gaps will serve as a powerful catalyst for change and compel them to confront gender pay inequalities head on. Under the stewardship of the Labor government, the gender pay gap has fallen to its lowest point in a decade, with the latest figures revealing a 14.8 per cent gap in the private sector and a notably reduced 10.4 per cent gap in the public sector. We should recognise this as tangible progress. However, despite these remarkable strides in recent years, there is still so much work to be done. For the first time in our nation's history under the Albanese government, we boast a majority of the federal caucus being women, with a record number of women occupying seats in cabinet. This milestone isn't just a symbol; it is transformative. It underscores our firm belief in the power of diversity and the proven impact of having women at the decision-making table. Let me be clear: it makes a big difference. Having women in positions of leadership isn't just about representation; it's about driving solid change. It's about recognising the unique perspectives and experiences that women bring to the parliament and utilising them to shape policies that uplift and empower all members of our society. Over the course of Labor's first two budgets, we have also made significant investments aimed at supporting women in every aspect of our lives. Whether it's through increased funding for child care, extended paid parental leave provisions, bolstering women's safety initiatives or advocating for fairer wages, we have left no stone unturned in our quest to level the playing field for women across this great nation. By prioritising gender-sensitive policies, we are not only advancing the economic interests of women but also fostering a more equitable and inclusive society for all. To take an example: Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts policy will put more money back into the pockets of 90 per cent of taxpaying women. Further, we are forging ahead with the development of a comprehensive national strategy to achieve gender equality. This strategy will serve as a road map—a blueprint—for building a future where every woman has the opportunity to thrive and succeed unrestricted by the constraints of gender bias and discrimination. In closing, let me leave you with some sobering statistics. While Australia has made strides in recent years, we still have much ground to cover, with a national gender pay gap of 13 per cent. Women continue to earn $252.30 less per week than their male counterparts. These disparities are not just numbers; they represent the lived experiences of millions of women. It is truly our duty to ensure that they are afforded the same opportunities, rights and dignity as their male counterparts. I have met a lot of great women here, and seeing the diversity in parliament gives me the opportunity to go out to my community and point to our example. I look forward to attending many events in my electorate, especially all the breakfasts and lunches! I'm looking forward to all that. To all the women members of parliament, all the women working in this building, all the women who live in my community of Holt, all Victorian women and all women across this great nation, I say happy International Women's Day! The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Ms Sharkie ): There being no further grievances, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will made an order of the day for the next sitting. Federation Chamber adjourned at 1 8 : 17","Gender Equality","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms FERNANDO (Holt) ","(18:11):"
